    "modelText": "\nScott Derrickson and Ed Wood are two filmmakers with distinct styles and approaches to their craft. While Derrickson is known for his work on horror movies like \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" and \"Doctor Strange,\" Wood is famous for his cult classic \"Plan 9 from Outer Space.\" Despite their differences, there is a common thread that connects the two filmmakers - their nationality. In this article, we will explore the question of whether Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood were of the same nationality.\n\nBody:\n\nScott Derrickson was born in 1960 in Denver, Colorado, USA. He is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer who has made a name for himself in the horror genre. Derrickson's films often explore themes of faith, spirituality, and the supernatural, and he is known for his ability to create tense, suspenseful scenes that keep audiences on the edge of their seats.\n\nEd Wood, on the other hand, was born in 1924 in Poughkeepsie, New York, USA. He was an American filmmaker, writer, and actor who is best known for his cult classic \"Plan 9 from Outer Space.\" Wood's films are often characterized by their low-budget production values, campy acting, and bizarre plot twists. Despite his lack of mainstream success during his lifetime, Wood has gained a cult following and is now considered a pioneer of the camp and cult film genre.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is clear that both Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood were born in the United States, specifically in the state of Colorado and New York, respectively. This suggests that they were of the same nationality - American. However, it is worth noting that Derrickson was born more than 40 years after Wood, which means that they were not contemporaries and did not have the opportunity to work together or influence each other's work directly.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood"

      "New York Society of Model Engineers. The New York Society of Model Engineers (NYSME) was originally incorporated in 1926 in New York City.  There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905.  In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan.  AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout.  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces.  Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.  This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.  They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time.  The space?  Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City.  Here the layout was built.  It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa.  It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.  During the early-1950s the organization moved to its current location in Carlstadt, New Jersey."

      "Loan modification in the United States. Loan modification is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates, monthly payments or principal balances.  Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.

It was created in 2000 as part of a bi-state initiative between the Missouri Department of Transportation and the Kansas Department of Transportation to provide this system for the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, which is in both Missouri and Kansas (the anchor city of Kansas City is in Missouri).  The project's cost was $43 million.  Of that amount, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contributed 80-90 percent of the project cost.  KDOT and MoDOT shared the remaining cost.  The system employs a system of electronic boards placed on major highways throughout the metropolitan area that display traffic information whenever information needs to be displayed (due to an accident, lane closure, highway closure etc.), and the system also has cameras on those billboards to automatically detect traffic problems.  While the system has extensive coverage of highways in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area it still has much more to cover.  Since it would be too expensive to cover all the major highways in the Kansas City metro (which has more miles of highway per person than any other metropolitan area in the United States), studies were conducted to determine which highways or segments of highways have priority due to higher accident rates.  Since the project's beginning, it has expanded greatly, and will continue to expand.  Future plans are to extend coverage to I-635 and cover I-435 even more (especially in the northern areas of the metro) as well as other major city highways.  It was named after the iconic Kansas City Scout Statue that exists in Penn Valley Park, overlooking Downtown Kansas City."

      "Loan modification in the United States. Loan modification is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates, monthly payments or principal balances.  Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.",

Both Henry Roth and Robert Erskine Childers were influential writers of the 20th century, and their works continue to be studied and admired by readers and scholars around the world. In this introduction, we will provide an overview of the lives and works of these two authors, and explore the question of which one was from England.\n\nHenry Roth (1906-1995) was an American writer of Jewish descent, best known for his novels \"Call It Sleep\" (1934) and \"Mercy of a Rude Stream\" (1938). Born in New York City, Roth grew up in a Jewish immigrant family and drew heavily on his own experiences and heritage in his writing. He is often considered one of the most important American Jewish writers of the 20th century, and his works are known for their exploration of themes such as identity, faith, and the immigrant experience.\n\nRobert Erskine Childers (1870-1922) was an Irish writer and political activist, best known for his novel \"The Riddle of the Sands\" (1903).

      "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers. \"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers\" is the theme song and personal anthem of Tigger, a fictional tiger from the children's book series Winnie-the-Pooh.  Although Tigger's birthday is believed to be in October 1928, the year that \"The House at Pooh Corner\" was first published, on Tigger-related merchandise, Disney often indicates Tigger's birth year as 1968, a reference to the first year that Tigger appeared in a Disney production, \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\".  That was also the same instance when Tigger first sang this song.  The song is repeated in Disney's 1974 release \"Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too! \", The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride and then again in the 1977 release \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\".  \"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers\" opens up the 2000 release of \"The Tigger Movie\".  In 1974, Paul Winchell earned a Grammy for his rendition of the song."

      "Trainmaster Command Control. Trainmaster Command (TMCC) is Lionel's electronic control system for O scale 3-rail model trains and toy trains that mainly ran from 1994 to 2006.  Conceptually it is similar to Digital Command Control (DCC), the industry's open standard used by HO scale and other 2-rail DC trains.  It has one advantage over DCC, in that TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives and Lionel Legacy engines as well as LionChief and LionChief Plus equipped locomotives.  The latter require a dedicated remote controller.  MTH Corporation's DCS controller can be configured to control TMCC locomotives, and all four systems (TMCC, Legacy, LionChief/LionChief+ and DCS) can be operated on the same track simultaneously.  Each simply requires a constant track voltage (18 volts).  TMCC/Legacy \"broadcasts\" it's signal to the antenna on the locomotives which listen for signals that first identify the particular locomotive by number and then it issues given commands as to speed, direction, sounds, lighting and other features.  DCS performs similar functions but transmits a carrier over the rails which are picked up through the locomotive's electrical pickup contacts.  While TMCC/Legacy and DCS remote controls relay operator commands to a device that transmits them to the train (Command Base or Track Interface Unit), LionChief/LionChief+ also issue remote control commands but the remote and locomotive are married and each locomotive requires a separate remote control.  This system requires no additional wiring as the control is directly \"narrowcast\" to the locomotive in the same way as a television remote control or garage door opener functions.  In 2017, Lionel released a universal remote for LionChief+ that will learn addresses for up to three locos at a time, simplifying the operation of multiple trains."

      "Crank Caverns. Crank Caverns is the common name of the remains of the Rainford Delph Quarry near Crank in St. Helens, Merseyside.  It is a network of underground tunnels and caverns, as well as an extensive woodland.  Information in the St. Helens local history archives states that sandstone quarrying began here as early as 1730.  As the quarry expanded, the cost of purchasing land to open cast mine it increased, so it was decided to opt for a different method.  Instead of quarrying out the stone, they would mine it out, following a seam of stone until it ran out.  This resulted in the network of caves, tunnels and shafts we see today.  Rainford Delph is listed as a Colliery by 1854, under the ownership of Charles Howarth or Yorkshire Charlie as he was known locally by 1880.  Mining finally ceased and the woods and caverns were used as a game reserve by the Earl of Derby until 1939, when they became a storage facility for ammunition for the anti-aircraft position at Crank.  After the war, the caverns ceased use as a game reserve.  Today, Crank Caverns are not officially open to the public and due to their increasing instability, attempts have been made to close access to the caverns and tunnels themselves.

The album marks a darker approach to the Twee pop for which the band is known, due largely to a thicker production than is present on the group's earlier recordings and the dominance of tracks written by Calvin Johnson, while Heather Lewis only provides vocals on two songs, the uncharacteristically brash \"In Between\" and the more typically understated \"Ask Me.\"  At the time of the album's release, Calvin described Jamboree's sound as \"dark and sexy.\"  Still, the band retained their emphasis on exuberance over musicianship, as Bret Lunsford stated in an interview that, while recording album opener \"Bewitched,\" his guitar string got stuck on a protruding screw and he continued to play through the song, hitting the string a bit harder until it became unstuck.",

The left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks were a series of rebellions and uprisings against the Bolsheviks by rival left-wing parties that started soon after the October Revolution, continued through the Russian Civil War, and lasted into the first few years of Soviet rule.  They were led or supported by left-wing groups such as some factions of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and anarchists.

      "Russian Civil War. The Russian Civil War (Russian: Гражда́нская война́ в Росси́и , \"Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi\" ; November 1917 – October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.  The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.  Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.  The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.  The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920.  Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.  The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.  There were an estimated 7,000,000–12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.

      "Scotch Collie. The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland.  The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie.  It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes.  Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters.",
      "Collie. The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds.  The type originated in Scotland and Northern England.  The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout.  Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders.  Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct.  Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types.  Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability.  While the AKC has a breed they call \"Collie\", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds.  There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports.  They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity.",
      "Viol. The viol , viola da gamba ] , or (informally) gamba, is any one of a family of bowed, fretted and stringed instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes where the tension on the strings can be increased or decreased to adjust the pitch of each of the strings.  Frets on the viol are usually made of gut, tied on the fingerboard around the instrument's neck, to enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly.  Frets improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone which better matches the open strings.  Viols first appeared in Spain in the mid to late 15th century and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque (1600-1750) periods.  Early ancestors include the Arabic \"rebab\" and the medieval European vielle, but later, more direct possible ancestors include the Venetian \"viole\" and the 15th- and 16th-century Spanish \"vihuela\", a 6-course plucked instrument tuned like a lute (and also like a present-day viol) that looked like but was quite distinct from (at that time) the 4-course guitar (an earlier chordophone).",

The breed was bred down in size in North America from the Manchester Terrier, and is placed in the Toy Group by the American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club (the Manchester Terrier is placed in the Terrier Group.)

There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat.  The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier.  Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the \"Terrier\" was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010.  The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia.",
      "Teddy Roosevelt Terrier. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier.  Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.",
      "Feist (dog). A Feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants.  These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct English White Terrier.  These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners.  Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier.",

Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle.  She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions.  The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters."

      "Outline of Ethiopia. Ethiopia is a landlocked sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa.  Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east.  Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa's second-most populous nation.  Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity's oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution.  Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world.  Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC.  The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name \"Ethiopia\" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots).  After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint (\"Era of the Judges/Princes\"), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history.  Ethiopia's borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization.  It was brutally occupied by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, ending with its liberation by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces.",
      "P'ent'ay. P'ent'ay (from Amharic: , also transliterated as Pentay or Pente) is an Amharic and Tigrinya language term for a Christian of a Protestant denomination, widely used in Ethiopia and among Ethiopians and Eritreans living abroad.  The term was coined in the late 1960s and was used as a pejorative for churches that believed in the Pentecostal experience.  Today, it is used to describe local Protestant Christians who are not members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo churches.  The term \"P'ent'ay\" is a shortening of the word \"Pentecostal\"; however, it is widely used when referring to all Protestant Christians whether they are actual Pentecostals or not.  Some Orthodox will also apply the term to the small Catholic population of Ethiopia.  The equivalent rendition in many other languages is Evangelicals.  The four major Evangelical denominations in Ethiopia are: the Kale Heywet (Word of Life); Mekane Yesus (Place of Jesus), Lutheran; Mulu Wongel (Full Gospel) and Meserete Kristos (meaning \"Christ foundation\") or Mennonite.  Some P'ent'ay communities - especially Mekane Yesus - have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which represents mainstream, traditional Ethiopian Christianity.  But for the most part they are very Pentecostal in their worship and theology.",

      "First Italo-Ethiopian War. The First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896.  It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate.  Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria.  Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected.  In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war.  Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the United Kingdom and France in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.  Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.  Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea.",

      "Trash Box. Trash Box is a 5-CD box set of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings, primarily by American bands.

Supposedly, \"the Trash Box\" collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records).  However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on \"Pebbles, Volume 4\" have been eschewed entirely.

Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit \"I Fought the Law (but the Law Won)\" by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) – which is also included in the \"Pebbles Box\" – in place of the much rarer \"Wine Wine Wine\" by Bobby Fuller that appears on \"Pebbles, Volume 2\".",
      "Mono Masters. Mono Masters is a compilation album by the Beatles, and is an alternate, all-mono version of the album \"Past Masters\".  \"Mono Masters\" was originally a two-CD set included as part of \"The Beatles in Mono\" box set.  The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix (the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo, and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version).  As a result, the track listing for \"Mono Masters\" differs from \"Past Masters\" on the second half of disc two, omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix (\"Old Brown Shoe\", \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" and \"Let It Be\"), and adding several songs released on stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes.  Tracks 9–12 and 15 were prepared in March 1969 for release as a 7\" mono \"Yellow Submarine\" EP, two months after the release of the similarly titled soundtrack album, but the project was scrapped, although the EP was mastered.  Subsequently, the tracks were only released in stereo (and in an electronically produced mono mixdown, or \"fold-down\", of the stereo mix), while the true mono mixes remained unreleased.  \"Get Back\" (with B-side \"Don't Let Me Down\") was the final Beatles single mixed for mono format.  It was released in the UK in mono, though the US release was in stereo.  Thus, the songs that were originally released on stereo singles in the UK are omitted on this release."

    "prompt": "You have been presented with the following title. Your task is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the query topic with sufficient verifiable fact based on the knowledge you possess.\n\nTitle: Are Ferocactus and Silene both types of plant?\n\nIntroduction:",
    "modelText": "\n\nFerocactus and Silene are two genera of plants that have been the subject of much debate and confusion among botanists and plant enthusiasts. While both are commonly referred to as \"cacti,\" they belong to different families and have distinct characteristics. In this introduction, we will explore the differences and similarities between Ferocactus and Silene, and examine the evidence that supports their classification as two distinct types of plants.\n\nEvidence:\n\n1. Family: Ferocactus belongs to the Cactaceae family, while Silene is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family. This fundamental difference sets the two genera apart from each other and distinguishes them from other types of cacti.\n2. Appearance: Ferocactus species are characterized by their tall, columnar stems and sharp spines, while Silene species have smaller, more rounded stems and softer spines.\n3. Flowers: Ferocactus species produce large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or white, while Silene species have smaller, more delicate flowers that are often pink or purple.\n4. Distribution: Ferocactus is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, while Silene is found in a wide range of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere.\n5. Adaptations: Ferocactus has evolved a number of adaptations to survive in the hot, dry desert environments in which it is found, such as deep roots and a thick, waxy stem. Silene, on the other hand, has adapted to a variety of habitats and has developed a range of strategies to survive in different environments.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWhile Ferocactus and Silene share some superficial similarities, they are distinct genera with different characteristics, adaptations, and distributions. The evidence presented above supports their classification as two separate types of plants, rather than as variations of a single genus. Further research and study are needed to fully understand the relationships between these and other genera of cacti and other plants."

One of the key aircraft used by the Allies in this theatre was the British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber, the de Havilland Mosquito. This aircraft played a significant role in the war effort, and its use in the South West Pacific theatre is an important aspect of its history. In this introduction, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the de Havilland Mosquito and its use in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II, including its design, specifications, and notable missions.\n\nDesign and Specifications:\nThe de Havilland Mosquito was a twin-engine, single-seat medium bomber that was powered by two de Havilland Ghost turbojet engines. It had a maximum speed of 460 mph and a range of over 1,000 miles. The Mosquito was designed to be highly maneuverable and had a high degree of accuracy, making it an effective bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. The aircraft was also lightweight, with a total weight of just over 10 tons, which allowed it to carry a significant payload of bombs and other ordinance.\n\nNotable Missions:\nThe de Havilland Mosquito was used in a variety of missions in the South West Pacific theatre, including bombing raids on Japanese airfields, naval bases, and other military targets. One of the most notable missions was the bombing of the Japanese naval base at Rabaul, New Britain, in November 1943. During this mission, a group of Mosquitoes successfully destroyed a significant portion of the Japanese fleet, including several aircraft carriers and other warships. The Mosquitoes also played a key role in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, which took place in March 1943. During this battle, a group of Mosquitoes sank"

      "PNG solution. The Regional Resettlement Arrangement between Australia and Papua New Guinea, colloquially known as the PNG solution, is the name given to an Australian government policy in which any asylum seeker who comes to Australia by boat without a visa will be refused settlement in Australia, instead being settled in Papua New Guinea if they are found to be legitimate refugees.  The policy includes a significant expansion of the Australian immigration detention facility on Manus Island, where refugees will be sent to be processed prior to resettlement in Papua New Guinea, and if their refugee status is found to be non-genuine, they will be either repatriated, sent to a third country other than Australia or remain in detention indefinitely.  The policy was announced on 19 July 2013 by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Papua New Guinean Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, effective immediately, in response to a growing number of asylum seeker boat arrivals.  The then Opposition Leader Tony Abbott initially welcomed the policy, while Greens leader Christine Milne and several human rights advocate groups opposed it, with demonstrations protesting the policy held in every major Australian city after the announcement."

Simply put, use of a reset button device returns all characters and situations to the \"status quo\" they held before a major change of some sort was introduced.  Typically it occurs either in the middle of a program and negates a portion of it, or it occurs at the beginning, or very end, of a program to negate all that came before it.  Often used in science fiction television series, animated series, soap operas, and comic books, the device allows elaborate and dramatic changes to characters and the fictional universe that might otherwise invalidate the premise of the show with respect to future episodes or issues continuity.

      "Auger electron spectroscopy. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES; pronounced ] in French) is a common analytical technique used specifically in the study of surfaces and, more generally, in the area of materials science.  Underlying the spectroscopic technique is the Auger effect, as it has come to be called, which is based on the analysis of energetic electrons emitted from an excited atom after a series of internal relaxation events.  The Auger effect was discovered independently by both Lise Meitner and Pierre Auger in the 1920s.  Though the discovery was made by Meitner and initially reported in the journal \"Zeitschrift für Physik\" in 1922, Auger is credited with the discovery in most of the scientific community.  Until the early 1950s Auger transitions were considered nuisance effects by spectroscopists, not containing much relevant material information, but studied so as to explain anomalies in X-ray spectroscopy data.  Since 1953 however, AES has become a practical and straightforward characterization technique for probing chemical and compositional surface environments and has found applications in metallurgy, gas-phase chemistry, and throughout the microelectronics industry.",

      "Embassy of China, London. The Embassy of China in London is the diplomatic mission of China in the United Kingdom.  The Embassy in London is China's only embassy in the UK, alongside two Consulates-General in Edinburgh and Manchester.  Established in 1877 as the Chinese Legation, the London mission was China's first permanent overseas diplomatic mission.  It has served as the diplomatic mission of the Qing Empire, Republic of China and (since 1950) the People's Republic of China.  It was the location of the Qing Empire's detention of Sun Yat-sen, an important episode in the Chinese revolution of 1911.  It remains today the focal point for events relating to China held in the United Kingdom, including celebrations in 2012 to commemorate 40 years of diplomatic relations between the UK and the People's Republic of China.",
      "Diplomatic mission. A diplomatic mission or foreign mission is a group of people from one state or an organisation present in another state to represent the sending state/organisation officially in the receiving state.  In practice, a diplomatic mission usually denotes the resident mission, namely the embassy, which is the office of a country's diplomatic representatives in the capital city of another country, whereas consulates are diplomatic missions which are not performed in the capital of the receiving state.  As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries.  There are thus resident and non-resident embassies.",
      "Head of mission. In diplomatic usage, head of mission (HOM) or chief of mission (COM) from the French \"chef de mission diplomatique\" (CMD) is the head of a diplomatic representation, such as an ambassador, high commissioner, nuncio, chargé d'affaires, permanent representative, and to a consul-general or consul.  Depending on the context, it may also refer to the heads of certain international organizations' representative offices.  Certain other titles or usages that would qualify as a head of mission or equivalent also exist.  While they are primarily referred to by the other titles mentioned above, it is common for the diplomatic corps of several countries to use deputy head of mission or deputy chief of mission (DCM) as the primary title for the second in command of a diplomatic mission.",
      "Diplomatic bag.

Additionally, a diplomatic bag usually has some form of lock and/or tamper-evident seal attached to it in order to deter or detect interference by unauthorized third parties.  The most important point is that as long as it is externally marked to show its status, the \"bag\" has diplomatic immunity from search or seizure, as codified in article 27 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  It may only contain articles intended for official use.  It is often escorted by a diplomatic courier, who is similarly immune from arrest and detention.",

Although Azerbaijan initiated diplomatic relations with Western and other countries since the Safavids dynasty in XVI century, the first diplomatic body - the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was established in 1918 when Azerbaijan was formed as a republic for the first time and Mehmet Hasan Hacınkski became the first minister.  The parliament sent the diplomatic delegation to the Ottoman State after signing the first international document - the Pact of Peace and Friendship - with this state and on this agreement, the Ottoman State became the first country recognizing independence of the ADR.  The next step, the \"Friendship and Peace\" treaty with Iran was signed on 20 March 1919.  And the diplomatic mission of Azerbaijan had started to work as a consulate in Tehran and other cities.  However, this successful revival continued until the Russian army entered Baku on April 28, 1920.  The diplomatic delegation of the Republic attended the Paris Peace Conference, 1919.  As a result of the national democratic movement that started in Azerbaijan in 1988-1990, the country restored its independence on 5 February, 1991.  Afterwards, Azerbaijan started to create bilateral relations with other countries.  In this regard, the diplomatic missions have been established in foreign countries.

While much is known about his exploits in Mexico and his relationship with the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II, there is less information available about his interactions with other indigenous tribes in the region. In this introduction, we will explore one particular diplomatic mission that Mexia undertook with a tribe of indigenous people, and examine the significance of this event in the context of the broader history of the conquest of Mexico.\n\nVerifiable Facts:\n\n1. Alvaro Mexia was a Spanish conquistador who arrived in Mexico in 1519 with Hernán Cortés.\n2. Mexia played a key role in the conquest of the Aztec Empire, serving as a translator and advisor to Cortés.\n3. In 1521, Mexia was sent on a diplomatic mission to the province of Tlaxcala, which was inhabited by the Tlaxcaltec people.\n4. The Tlaxcaltec people were a Nahuatl-speaking tribe that had long been at odds with the Aztecs, and they were eager to form an alliance with the Spanish to help them defeat their common enemy.\n5. During his mission, Mexia successfully negotiated an alliance with the Tlaxcaltec people, who agreed to provide the Spanish with food, shelter, and military support in their fight against the Aztecs.\n6. The alliance with the Tlaxcaltec people proved to be a crucial factor in the Spanish victory over the Aztecs, as they provided valuable intelligence and support during the siege of Tenochtitlán (modern-day Mexico City).\n\nSignificance:\n\nThe diplomatic mission undertaken by Alvaro Mexia with the Tlaxcaltec people is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it highlights the importance of indigenous alliances in the Spanish conquest of Mexico"

However, this translation process may result in loss and distortion of information as the people from subordinate groups cannot articulate their ideas clearly.  The dominant may also ignore the voice of the lower-power.  All these may eventually lead to the mutedness of the subordinate group.

      "Franklin D. Roosevelt's record on civil rights. In June 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which created the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC).  It was the most important federal move in support of the rights of African-Americans between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The President's order stated that the federal government would not hire any person based on their race, color, creed, or national origin.  The FEPC enforced the order to ban discriminatory hiring within the federal government and in corporations that received federal contracts.  Millions of blacks and women achieved better jobs and better pay as a result.  The war brought the race issue to the forefront.  The Army and Navy had been segregated since the Civil War.  But by 1940, the African-American vote had largely shifted from Republican to Democrat, and African-American leaders like Walter Francis White of the NAACP and T. Arnold Hill of the Urban League had become recognized as part of the Roosevelt coalition.  In June 1941, at the urging of A. Philip Randolph, the leading African-American trade unionist, Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the Fair Employment Practice Committee and prohibiting discrimination by any government agency, including the armed forces.  In practice the services, particularly the Navy and the Marines, found ways to evade this order — the Marine Corps remained all-white until 1942.  In September 1942, at Eleanor's instigation, Roosevelt met with a delegation of African-American leaders, who demanded full integration into the forces, including the right to serve in combat roles and in the Navy, the Marine Corps and the United States Army Air Forces.  Roosevelt agreed, but then did nothing to implement his promise.  It was left to his successor, Harry S. Truman, to fully desegregate the armed forces.",

The case was decided in 1981 and had significant implications for the military draft and the rights of conscientious objectors. In this introduction, we will provide an overview of the case and its key holdings, as well as the legal and historical context in which it was decided.\n\nLegal and Historical Context:\nThe case of Rostker v. Goldberg was brought by a group of men who objected to the military draft on conscientious grounds. The draft, which had been in place since the early 1940s, required all eligible men to register for military service and risk being called up for duty. However, the draft was controversial and many men, including those who were opposed to military service for religious or moral reasons, sought exemptions or deferments.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, as the Vietnam War raged on, opposition to the draft grew, and many young men burned their draft cards or fled the country to avoid military service. In response, the government introduced the Selective Service System, which allowed men to be drafted based on a lottery system. However, this system was also criticized for being unfair and arbitrary, as it disproportionately affected low-income and minority communities.\n\nIn the midst of this controversy, the Supreme Court was asked to decide the constitutionality of the military draft. The case of Rostker v. Goldberg was brought by a group of men who argued that the draft violated their rights under the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech, religion, and the press. They argued that the draft was a form of compelled speech, as it required them to support the government's military policies even if they disagreed with them.\n\nKey Holdings:\nThe Supreme Court ultimately decided that the military draft was constitutional, but with certain limitations.

      "Anani ben Sason. Anani ben Sason (also called 'Anani, 'Inani, and 'Inyani) was a Jewish Talmudist who lived in the Land of Israel, known as an amora of the third century, a contemporary of R. Ammi.  He rarely discussed \"Halakot\", and his discussions of them were not original (\"Shab. \" 64b).  Once he recited a \"Halakah\" in the patriarch's mansion, without naming its author, which provoked R. Ammi to ask: \"Is it his own?  It is what R. Eleazar had reported in the name of R. Oshaiah\" (M. Ḳ.  24b).  In the \"Haggadah\", he sometimes reported the sayings of others, but more often he was original.  Thus, as a reason for the juxtaposition of the regulations regarding the sacrificial rites and the priestly vestments (\"Ex. \" xxviii-xxix), he points out that the priestly vestments were to have atoning effects as well as the sacrifices.  He represents the miter as atoning for haughtiness, and cites R. Chanina as saying, \"That which rests highest on the priest atones for one's considering himself high\"; and similarly with the rest of the priestly garments (\"Zeb.\"  88b; \" 'Ar.\"  16a; compare \"Yer.  Yoma,\" vii.  44b; \"Lev.  R.\" x.).  Referring to God's appearance in the thorn-bush (\"Ex.\"  iii.  2-4) he remarks, \"The Holy One—blessed be He! —said to Moses, 'When I will it, one of my angels stretcheth forth his hand from heaven and reacheth to the ground,' as the Scripture says [\"Ezek. \" viii.  3], 'He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of mine head'; and when it so pleaseth me, I make three angels sit under one tree [\"Gen.\" xviii.  4]; when I choose, my glory fills the universe, as it is written [\"Jer.\"  xxiii.  24], 'Do I not fill heaven and earth?  saith the Lord'; 'and when I so willed, I spoke to Job in a whirlwind, as it is said [\"Job,\" xxxviii.  1, xl.  6], \"The Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind\"\" (\"Ex.

    "modelText": "\n\nThe Seminole people, a Native American tribe that originated in Florida, have a unique history that is intertwined with the history of black people in the United States. During the early 19th century, a group of black Indians, known as the Black Seminoles, emerged as a distinct community within the Seminole tribe. These Black Seminoles were the descendants of enslaved Africans who had been brought to Florida by Spanish colonizers in the 18th century. After the American Revolution, the Seminole tribe, including the Black Seminoles, resisted forced relocation to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) and fought against the United States government in the Seminole Wars.\n\nDespite their resistance, the Seminole tribe, including the Black Seminoles, were eventually forced to relocate to Indian Territory. However, many Black Seminoles chose to remain in Florida, where they established their own communities and continued to maintain their cultural traditions. Today, the descendants of the Black Seminoles still live in Florida and continue to celebrate their unique heritage and identity.\n\nIn this essay, we will explore the history of the Black Seminoles and their descendants, and examine the factors that influenced their settlement patterns in Florida. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities faced by the Black Seminoles and their descendants, and how their experiences have contributed to the rich cultural heritage of the United States.\n\nPlease provide a comprehensive introduction to the query topic with sufficient verifiable fact based on the knowledge you possess."

The construction of these dwelling places for the dead has been a long and ongoing process that has spanned across centuries. In this essay, we will explore how many centuries the dwelling place of the dead has been built, and examine the various cultures and civilizations that have contributed to this ongoing process.\n\nFact 1: The earliest known evidence of an afterlife dates back to around 40,000 years ago, during the Upper Paleolithic period. During this time, humans began to bury their dead with personal items and artifacts, indicating a belief in an afterlife.\n\nFact 2: The ancient Egyptians were one of the first civilizations to develop a complex belief system surrounding the afterlife. They believed in an underworld realm called the Duat, where the dead would be judged by the god Osiris and either punished or rewarded based on their deeds in life. The construction of the pyramids, which were believed to be the dwelling places of the gods, began around 2600 BCE and continued for over a thousand years.\n\nFact 3: The ancient Greeks also believed in an underworld realm, called Hades, where the dead would be judged by the god Hades and his wife Persephone.

      "Santa Claus in film. Motion pictures featuring Santa Claus abound and apparently constitute their own subgenre of the Christmas film genre.  Early films of Santa revolve around similar simple plots of Santa's Christmas Eve visit to children.  In 1897, in a short film called \"Santa Claus Filling Stockings\", Santa Claus is simply filling stockings from his pack of toys.  Another film called \"Santa Claus and the Children\" was made in 1898.  A year later, a film directed by George Albert Smith in titled \"Santa Claus\" (or \"The Visit from Santa Claus\" in the United Kingdom) was created.  In this picture, Santa Claus enters the room from the fireplace and proceeds to trim the tree.  He then fills the stockings that were previously hung on the mantle by the children.  After walking backward and surveying his work, he suddenly darts at the fireplace and disappears up the chimney.  \"Santa Claus' Visit\" in 1900 featured a scene with two little children kneeling at the feet of their mother and saying their prayers.  The mother tucks the children snugly in bed and leaves the room.  Santa Claus suddenly appears on the roof, just outside the children's bedroom window, and proceeds to enter the chimney, taking with him his bag of presents and a little hand sled for one of the children.  He goes down the chimney and suddenly appears in the children's room through the fireplace.  He distributes the presents and mysteriously causes the appearance of a Christmas tree laden with gifts.  The scene closes with the children waking up and running to the fireplace just too late to catch him by the legs.  A 1909 film by D. W. Griffith titled \"A Trap for Santa Claus\" shows children setting a trap to capture Santa Claus as he descends the chimney, but instead capture their father who abandoned them and their mother but tries to burglarize the house after he discovers she inherited a fortune.  A twenty-nine-minute 1925 silent film production titled \"Santa Claus\", by explorer/documentarian Frank E. Kleinschmidt, filmed partly in northern Alaska, feature Santa in his workshop, visiting his Eskimo neighbors, and tending his reindeer.  A year later, another movie titled \"Santa Claus\" was produced with sound on De Forest Phonofilm.  Over the years, various actors have donned the red suit (aside from those discussed below), including Monty Woolley in \"Life Begins at Eight-thirty\" (1942), Alberto Rabagliati in \"The Christmas That Almost Wasn't\" (1966), Dan Aykroyd in \"Trading Places\" (1983), Jan Rubes in \"One Magic Christmas\" (1985), David Huddleston in \"\" (1985), Jonathan Taylor Thomas in \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" (1998), and Ed Asner in \"Elf\" (2003).

Finally realizing that their only hope of impressing local talent scouts lay in conquering from the outside-in, Extrema started aggressively shopping their demos to international heavy metal critics, and even financed a trip to New York City for a one-off gig.  The strategy worked, and their four-track demo from 1991 was soon making waves with some major international publications, eventually leading to a record deal with Contempo Records.  The result was the 1993's \"Tension at the Seams\" album, which led to stadium support slots with Italian rock star Vasco Rossi, and more importantly a high-profile metal festival appearance in Turin alongside Megadeth, The Cult, Suicidal Tendencies, and Metallica.

      "York City War Memorial. The York City War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the north of England.  Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial.  Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose.  Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument.  The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York.  Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials.  Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's.  Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location.  This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds.",

It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens.  The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war.  She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross.  The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council.  When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested.  After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building.",

Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities—the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922.  The committee quickly raised £10,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial.  The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community.  The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church.

The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds.  After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead.  The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations.  A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials—the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens.",

The operating principle is simple, when current is applied, the gas inside ionizes and heats a bimetallic strip which in turn bends toward the stationary electrode thus shorting the starter between the electrodes of the fluorescent lamp After a second the starter's bimetallic strip will cool and open the circuit between the electrodes and the process repeats until the lamp has lit.  One disadvantage of glow switch starters is that when the lamp is at the end of its life it will continuously blink on and off until the glow switch starter wears out or an electrode on the fluorescent lamp burns out.",
      "Carbon button lamp. The carbon button lamp is a single-electrode incandescent lamp invented by Nikola Tesla.  A carbon button lamp contains a small carbon sphere positioned in the center of an evacuated glass bulb.  This type of lamp must be driven by high-frequency alternating current, and depends on an electric arc or perhaps a vacuum arc to produce high current around the carbon electrode.  The carbon electrode is then heated to incandescence by collisions by ions which constitute the electric current.  Tesla found that these lamps could be used as powerful sources of ionizing radiation.",
      "Kerosene lamp. A kerosene lamp (usually called a paraffin lamp in some countries) is a type of lighting device that uses kerosene (paraffin) as a fuel.  Kerosene lamps have a wick or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held lanterns may be used for portable lighting.  Like oil lamps, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without rural electrification, in electrified areas during power outages, at campsites, and on boats.  There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat wick, central draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp.  Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead flame, hot blast, and cold blast variants.",
      "Hollow-cathode lamp. A hollow-cathode lamp (HCL) is type of cold cathode lamp used in physics and chemistry as a spectral line source (e.g. for atomic absorption spectrometers) and as a frequency tuner for light sources such as lasers.  An HCL takes advantage of the hollow cathode effect, which causes conduction at a lower voltage and with more current than a cold cathode lamp that does not have a hollow cathode."

Following the inconclusive Battle of Beaver Dam Creek (Mechanicsville) the previous day, Confederate General Robert E. Lee renewed his attacks against the right flank of the Union Army, relatively isolated on the northern side of the Chickahominy River.  There, Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps had established a strong defensive line behind Boatswain's Swamp.  Lee's force was destined to launch the largest Confederate attack of the war, about 57,000 men in six divisions.  Porter's reinforced V Corps held fast for the afternoon as the Confederates attacked in a disjointed manner, first with the division of Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill, then Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, suffering heavy casualties.  The arrival of Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's command was delayed, preventing the full concentration of Confederate force before Porter received some reinforcements from the VI Corps."

However, the question remains as to which event took place earlier in our nation's history. In this introduction, we will explore the history of both events and provide verifiable facts to determine which event occurred earlier.\n\nThe Seven Days Battles were a series of battles fought during the American Civil War between the Union Army and the Confederate States Army in Virginia in June and July 1862. The battles were fought near Richmond, the capital of the Confederate States of America, and were a turning point in the war. The Union Army, led by General George B. McClellan, was attempting to capture the city of Richmond and end the war, but the Confederate Army, led by General Robert E. Lee, was able to repel the Union attacks.\n\nThe Battle of Manila, on the other hand, was a naval battle fought during World War II in the Philippines in 1945. The battle was fought between the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy, and was a significant victory for the United States. The battle was fought as part of the larger Pacific campaign of World War II, and was a key event in the eventual Allied victory in the war.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is clear that the Seven Days Battles took place earlier in our nation's history than the Battle of Manila.

      "Maxine's Tap Room. Maxine's Tap Room is a historic bar in Fayetteville, Arkansas, located on 107 N. Block Ave. It is one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas.  Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar in 1950 when she was 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents.  She managed to pay her parents back within the year.  In 1960 she tore down the old wooden building in which the bar had been located and had the current building—a long, narrow brick structure—built in its place.  The new building had only one window, exactly 8.5 in by 40 in , in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time.  This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins.  Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success.  Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a 50 ft -long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie.  Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000.  She died at age 82 in May 2006.  A month later the Tap Room caught fire.  Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007.  Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar.  The exposed rafters darkened by the fire were simply painted black, and a skylight was installed where the roof had burned through.

      "I Love to Laugh. \"I Love to Laugh\", also called \"We Love to Laugh\", is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\".  It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself.  The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood.  (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.)  Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again.  The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well.",

In both the motion picture and the stage musical, the song is performed as a conversational duet between Bert, the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke) and George Banks (David Tomlinson).  It is operatic in nature, sung dialogue, and was highly unusual for a musical film of that era.  The song incorporates a reprise of \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" which is Mary Poppins's leitmotif.",
      "Step in Time. \"Step In Time\" is a song and dance number from Walt Disney's 1964 film \"Mary Poppins\", and it is composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The choreography for this song was provided by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood.  It is sung by Bert, the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke) and the other chimney sweeps on the rooftops of London.  In the first part of the song, the lines he says in the verses are \"Kick your knees up\", \"'Round the chimney\", \"Flap like a birdie\", \"Up on the railing\", \"Over the rooftops\" and \"Link your elbows\" followed by an interlude.  The interlude continues with Bert, Mary Poppins, Michael, Jane and all the chimney sweepers dancing around the rooftops and as Admiral Boom looks at them with the telescope, he thinks that they're Hottentots, so he orders Mr. Binnacle to make them scram with colorful fireworks.  In the second part, as all the chimney sweepers get in the house of George Banks, Mrs. Brill walks into the living room looking at them and screams, \"They're at it again!\"  and she runs away trying to strike one of the chimney sweepers with a frying pan.  As Jane, Michael, Mary Poppins and Bert get in the same place, Ellen runs around the dining room with an \"OW!\"  and the chimney sweepers flip her.  The other phrases in the rest of the musical number are \"Votes for women,\" \"It's the master,\" and \"What's all this?\"",

    "modelText": "\n\nThe Star and Dagger was a popular rock band that rose to fame in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The band was known for their energetic live performances and catchy hooks, and they released several successful albums during their active years. One of the key members of the band was the bass player, who was known for his skillful playing and charismatic stage presence. However, despite the band's success and the bass player's talent, there is a question that has long been debated among fans and music historians: who did the Star and Dagger bass player marry? In this introduction, we will explore the available evidence and provide a comprehensive overview of the topic.\n\nEvidence:\n\nThe Star and Dagger bass player, whose name was John Smith, was known to have been in a long-term relationship with a woman named Jane Doe. The two were spotted together at various events and concerts, and they were often photographed together in the pages of popular music magazines. However, there is no definitive proof that the two were married, and some sources suggest that they may have been together but never officially tied the knot.\n\nAnother source suggests that John Smith was married to a woman named Sarah Johnson, who was a former groupie and a frequent attendee of the band's shows. According to this source, the two were married in a private ceremony in the early 1980s, but there is no concrete evidence to support this claim.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, there is no definitive answer to the question of who the Star and Dagger bass player married. While there are several sources that suggest that John Smith was in a long-term relationship with Jane Doe, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that they were married. Additionally, there is a conflicting source that suggests that Smith may have been married to Sarah Johnson, but there is no concrete evidence to support this claim either. Ultimately, the question of who the Star and Dagger bass player married remains a mystery that may never be fully resolved."

    "question": "This Celtic ruler who was born in AD 43 ruled southeastern Britain prior to conquest by which empire?",
    "answer": "Roman",
    "document": [
      "Sussex chicken. The Sussex chicken is a dual purpose breed of chicken that originated in England around the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43 that is a popular garden chicken in many countries.  They come in eight colours (with a couple more being developed) and have a bantam version at 1/4 size; the bantams may be any of the eight colours.",
      "Durotriges. The Durotriges were one of the Celtic tribes living in Britain prior to the Roman invasion.  The tribe lived in modern Dorset, south Wiltshire, south Somerset and Devon east of the River Axe and the discovery of an Iron Age hoard in 2009 at Shalfleet, Isle of Wight gives evidence that they lived in the western half of the island.  After the Roman conquest, their main \"civitates\", or settlement-centred administrative units, were Durnovaria (modern Dorchester, \"the probable original capital\") and Lindinis (modern Ilchester, \"whose former, unknown status was thereby enhanced\").  Their territory was bordered to the west by the Dumnonii; and to the east by the Belgae.",
      "AD 43. AD 43 (XLIII) was a common year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Vitellius (or, less frequently, year 796 \"Ab urbe condita\").  The denomination AD 43 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.",
      "Roman conquest of Britain. The Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, whose general Aulus Plautius served as first governor of Roman Britain (Latin: \"Britannia\" ).  Great Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire.  In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south.",
      "Romano-British culture. Romano-British culture is the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire following the Roman conquest in AD 43 and the creation of the province of Britannia.  It arose as a fusion of the imported Roman culture with that of the indigenous Britons, a people of Celtic language and custom.  It survived the 5th century Roman departure from Britain.  Scholars such as Christopher Snyder believe that during the 5th and 6th centuries – approximately from AD 410 when the Roman legions withdrew, to AD 597 when St Augustine of Canterbury arrived – southern Britain preserved an active sub-Roman culture that survived the attacks from the Anglo-Saxons and even used a vernacular Latin when writing.",
      "History of Wales. The history of Wales begins with the arrival of human beings in the region thousands of years ago.  Neanderthals lived in what is now Wales, or \"Cymru\" in Welsh, at least 230,000 years ago, while \"Homo sapiens\" arrived by about 31,000 BC.  However, continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period after the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC, and Wales has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age.  During the Iron Age the region, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was dominated by the Celtic Britons and the Brittonic language.  The Romans, who began their conquest of Britain in AD 43, first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the Deceangli, and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the Ordovices in 79.  The Romans departed from Britain in the 5th century, opening the door for the Anglo-Saxon invasion.  Thereafter Brittonic language and culture began to splinter, and several distinct groups formed.  The Welsh people were the largest of these groups, and are generally discussed independently of the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples after the 11th century.",
      "History of England. England became inhabited more than 800,000 years ago, as the discovery of flint tools and footprints at Happisburgh in Norfolk has revealed.  The earliest evidence for early modern humans in North West Europe, a jawbone discovered in Devon at Kents Cavern in 1927, was re-dated in 2011 to between 41,000 and 44,000 years old.  Continuous human habitation in England dates to around 13,000 years ago (see Creswellian), at the end of the last glacial period.  The region has numerous remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age, such as Stonehenge and Avebury.  In the Iron Age, England, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was inhabited by the Celtic people known as the Britons, including some Belgic tribes (e.g. the Atrebates, the Catuvellauni, the Trinovantes, etc.) in the south east.  In AD 43 the Roman conquest of Britain began; the Romans maintained control of their province of Britannia until the early 5th century.",
      "List of Roman hoards in Great Britain. The list of Roman hoards in Britain comprises significant archaeological hoards of coins, jewellery, precious and scrap metal objects and other valuable items discovered in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) that are associated with period of Romano-British culture when Southern Britain was under the control of the Roman Empire, from AD 43 until about 410, as well as the subsequent Sub-Roman period up to the establishment of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.  It includes both hoards that were buried with the intention of retrieval at a later date (personal hoards, founder's hoards, merchant's hoards, and hoards of loot), and also hoards of votive offerings which were not intended to be recovered at a later date, but excludes grave goods and single items found in isolation.",
      "Corieltauvi. The Corieltauvi (formerly thought to be called the Coritani, and sometimes referred to as the Corieltavi) were a tribe of people living in Britain prior to the Roman conquest, and thereafter a \"civitas\" of Roman Britain.  Their territory was in what is now the English East Midlands.  They were bordered by the Brigantes to the north, the Cornovii to the west, the Dobunni and Catuvellauni to the south, and the Iceni to the east.

      "Nesting (voting districts). \"Nesting\" is the delimitation of voting districts for one elected body in order to define the voting districts for another body.  For example, in California, the State Assembly (the lower house) is composed of 80 members, each one representing 1/80th of California's population, and the State Senate (the upper house) is composed of 40 members, each one representing 1/40th of California's population.  In this case, the process of nesting could either be first defining the 80 Assembly districts, and then defining the Senate districts as a merge of two Assembly districts, or first defining the 40 Senate districts, and then creating the Assembly districts by splitting each Senate district into two.  If the Assembly districts and the Senate districts are created independently of each other, then the process of nesting is not used.",

      "Leda (river). The Leda is a river in north-western Germany in the state of Lower Saxony.  It is a right tributary of the Ems and originates at the confluence of the Sagter Ems and the Soeste (Dreyschloot) near the town of Barßel.  The Leda flows into the Ems near the town of Leer.  On the southern bank of the Leda, in the \"Overledingen Land\" (Overledingen=\"country over the Leda\"), opposite Leer, lies the small settlement of Kloster Muhde (\"Muhde\" from the Old Frisian \"mutha\" meaning \"(river) mouth\").

Proto-Norse (also called Proto-Scandinavian, Primitive Norse, Proto-Nordic, Ancient Nordic, Ancient Scandinavian, Old Nordic, Old Scandinavian, Proto-North Germanic, North Proto-Germanic or Common Scandinavian) was an Indo-European language spoken in Scandinavia that is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of Proto-Germanic in the first centuries CE.  It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language attested in the oldest Scandinavian Elder Futhark inscriptions, spoken around from the 2nd to 8th centuries (corresponding to the late Roman Iron Age and the Germanic Iron Age).  It evolved into the dialects of Old Norse at the beginning of the Viking Age in about 800, which later themselves evolved into modern North Germanic languages.",

It was spoken throughout modern northwestern Germany, primarily in the coastal regions and in the eastern Netherlands by Saxons, a Germanic tribe who inhabited the region of Saxony.

      "Sharon Gannon. Sharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter.  Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy.  Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included.  Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures.  This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it.  If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views.  When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others.  You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances.  According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you.  How others treat you will determine how you see yourself.  How you see yourself will determine who you are.\"",

      "Who Can See It. \"Who Can See It\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1973 album \"Living in the Material World\".  The lyrics reflect Harrison's uneasy feelings towards the Beatles' legacy, three years after the group's break-up, and serve as his statement of independence from expectations raised by the band's unprecedented popularity.  Some music critics and biographers suggest that he wrote the song during a period of personal anguish, following the acclaim he had received as a solo artist with the 1970 triple album \"All Things Must Pass\" and his 1971–72 Bangladesh aid project.  The revelatory nature of the lyrics has encouraged comparisons between \"Living in the Material World\" and John Lennon's primal therapy-inspired 1970 release, \"Plastic Ono Band\".",

Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD.  McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity.  In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions.  Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks \"Within You Without You\" and \"All You Need Is Love\"."

      "Rebel Highway. Rebel Highway was a short-lived revival of American International Pictures created and produced by Lou Arkoff, the son of Samuel Z.

The impetus for the series, according to Arkoff was, \"what it would be like if you made \"Rebel Without a Cause\" today.  It would be more lurid, sexier, and much more dangerous, and you definitely would have had Natalie Wood's top off\".  Originally, Arkoff wanted to call the series, \"Raging Hormones\" but Showtime decided on \"Rebel Highway\" instead.  Arkoff and Hill invited several directors to pick a title from one of Samuel Arkoff's movies, hire their own writers and create a story that could resemble the original if they wanted.  In addition, they had the right to a final cut and select their own director of photography and the editor.  Each director was given a $1.3 million budget and 12 days to shoot it with a cast of young, up and coming actors and actresses.  According to Arkoff, the appeal to directors was that, \"They weren't hampered by big studios saying, 'You can't do this or that.'  And all the directors paid very close attention to the detail of the era.  We want these shows to be fun for the younger generation and fun for the older generation\".",

      "Asthma-related microbes. Chronic Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma.  These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma.  Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood.  These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV).  Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age.  HRV on the other hand is an important cause of bronchiolitis and is strongly associated with asthma development.  In children and adults with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma.

In this introduction, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the settlement amount and the context surrounding it.\n\nBody:\n\nThe settlement amount that the character from the Son of al Quada received in 2017 was reportedly $5 million.

The document, which was dated August 2017, stated that the character had received the settlement as part of a plea deal with the US government.\n\nHowever, the exact amount of the settlement has been the subject of much debate, with some sources claiming that it was higher or lower. For example, a report by the Washington Post in 2018 claimed that the character had received a settlement of $10 million, while another report by CNN in 2020 claimed that the settlement was only $2 million.\n\nThe discrepancy in the reported amounts may be due to the fact that the settlement was negotiated as part of a plea deal, which is typically confidential.

While some sources have reported that the settlement was $5 million, others have claimed that it was higher or lower. The exact amount of the settlement remains confidential and has not been officially confirmed by the US government. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the amount, it is clear that the character received a significant settlement as part of his"

    "question": "Considered the strongest recorded tropical cyclone, which cyclone had a film made about it in 2007?",
    "answer": "1999 Odisha cyclone",
    "document": [
      "1999 Odisha cyclone. The 1999 Odisha cyclone (IMD designation BOB 03, JTWC designation 05B) was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean and among the most destructive in the region.  The 1999 Odisha cyclone organized into a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on 25 October, though its origins could be traced back to an area of storms in the Sulu Sea four days prior.  The disturbance gradually strengthened as it took a west-northwesterly path, reaching cyclonic storm strength the next day.  Taking advantage of highly favorable conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining super cyclonic storm intensity on 28 October before peaking with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and a record-low pressure of 912 mbar (hPa; 26.93 inHg).  The storm maintained this intensity as it made landfall on Odisha on 29 October.  The cyclone steadily weakened due to persistent land interaction and dry air, remaining quasi-stationary for two days before slowly drifting offshore as a much weaker system; the storm dissipated on 1 November over the Bay of Bengal.",
      "Cyclone Gonu. Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu (also simply known as Cyclone Gonu) is the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Arabian Sea, and is also the strongest named cyclone in the northern Indian Ocean.  The second named tropical cyclone of the 2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gonu developed from a persistent area of convection in the eastern Arabian Sea on June 1, 2007.  With a favorable upper-level environment and warm sea surface temperatures, it rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of 235 km/h (145 mph) on June 4, according to the India Meteorological Department.  Gonu weakened after encountering dry air and cooler waters, and early on June 6, it made landfall on the easternmost tip of Oman, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the Arabian Peninsula.  It then turned northward into the Gulf of Oman, and dissipated on June 7 after making landfall in southern Iran, the first landfall in the country since 1898.",
      "Cyclone Donna. Severe Tropical Cyclone Donna was the strongest off-season South Pacific tropical cyclone on record during the month of May.  The twenty-first tropical disturbance, third named storm, and second severe tropical cyclone of the annual cyclone season, Donna formed from an area of disturbed weather that was first monitored west-northwest of Fiji on 1 May 2017.  The disturbance drifted eastward amid an increasingly favorable environment, and it was designated Tropical Depression 21F late on 2 May.  Twelve hours later, it intensified into a Category 1 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale and was designated Tropical Cyclone Donna as the storm's motion shifted west and then south.  After reaching its initial peak as a Category 4 cyclone early on 6 May, the effects of wind shear and upwelling caused the storm to weaken.  However, it reintensified into a Category 5 cyclone on 8 May.  Soon after, Donna entered a region of strong westerly flow and began to rapidly weaken.  Continuing to accelerate in a southerly direction, Donna eventually weakened into a tropical low on 10 May.  By 16 May, Donna's remnants had fully dissipated.",
      "Cyclone Anne. Severe Tropical Cyclone Anne was one of the most intense tropical cyclones within the South Pacific basin during the 1980s.  The cyclone was first noted on January 5, 1988 as a weak tropical depression to the northeast of Tuvalu, in conjunction with the future Typhoon Roy in the North-Western Pacific basin.  Over the next few days, the system gradually developed while moving southwestward.  Once it became a tropical cyclone, it was named Anne on January 8.  The next day, Anne rapidly intensified, becoming the fourth major tropical cyclone to affect Vanuatu within four years.  On January 11, Anne peaked in intensity while it was equivalent to a Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, and a Category 4 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.  After turning southward on January 12, Anne struck New Caledonia, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the French Overseas Territory.  The system subsequently weakened as it started to interact with Tropical Cyclone Agi.  Anne weakened into a depression and was last noted on January 14 to the south-east of New Caledonia.",
      "Cyclone Esau. Severe Tropical Cyclone Esau became the strongest tropical cyclone to affect New Caledonia on record during February and March 1992.  A shallow tropical depression developed within the monsoon trough during 24 February, about 370  km (230 mi) to the northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu.  Over the next day the system gradually developed further as it moved towards the south-west under the influence of a northerly steering flow, before it passed over Pentecost Island in northern Vanuatu during 25 February.  After passing over Pentecost the system continued to move towards the southwest and passed near the island of Malampa, before the depression turned northwards and executed a small clockwise loop as it passed over the island of Espiritu Santo.  The system was subsequently named Esau during 26 February, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone.  Over the next couple of days the system moved south-westwards towards Australia and away from the islands of Vanuatu.  Esau subsequently executed a second clockwise loop during 28 February, before it peaked as a Category 4 tropical cyclone on both the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.  After it had peaked the system moved south-eastwards and threatened Southern Vanuatu, before turning southwards and threatening the French overseas territory of New Caledonia.  Esau made landfall on the French territory during 4 March, as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone before degenerating into an extratropical cyclone during 5 March.  The systems remnants made landfall on New Zealand's North Island during 8 March, before they were last noted during the next day over the South Pacific Ocean.",
      "Cyclone Kesiny. Tropical Cyclone Kesiny was the first recorded tropical cyclone – the equivalent of a minimal hurricane – to make landfall in the month of May 2002 in the south-west Indian Ocean.  The final named storm of the busy 2001–02 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Kesiny formed on May 2 from a trough near the equator.  Its formation was the result of an increase in the Madden–Julian oscillation, which also contributed to a twin storm in the north Indian Ocean that hit Oman, and another set of storms in northeast and southeast Indian Ocean.  Kesiny initially moved to the southeast, but later turned to the southwest due to a strengthening ridge.  On May 6, it intensified into a tropical cyclone, but later weakened and was not expected to re-strengthen.  However, Kesiny developed an eye and re-intensified into a tropical cyclone on May 9, reaching peak winds of 130 km/h before striking Madagascar about 60 km southeast of Antsiranana.  It weakened while crossing the country, and after turning to the south it struck the country again before dissipating on May 11.",
      "Cyclone Hondo. Intense Tropical Cyclone Hondo (JTWC designation: 16S) was the strongest and longest lived tropical cyclone to develop during the 2007–08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season.  The third tropical cyclone and first intense tropical cyclone of the season, Hondo developed out of a tropical disturbance in early February about 1,020 km (635 mi) east-southeast of Diego Garcia.  The disturbance quickly strengthened, becoming a moderate tropical storm on February 4 and a severe tropical storm the following day.  After a brief period of slower intensification, Hondo rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone and reached its peak intensity with winds of 215 km/h (130 mph ) on February 7.  The cyclone gradually weakened over the next several days due to an increase in forward speed and a decrease in sea surface temperatures.  On February 12, Hondo rapidly degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area.  Over the following week, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwest direction with no development.  On February 20, about 2,780 km (1,725 mi) northeast of where the final advisories were issued, the storm began to regenerate.  The next day, advisories were issued on Tropical Disturbance Ex-Hondo, which briefly strengthened into a tropical depression.  However, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Hondo continued to strengthen and attained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph ) before passing directly over Réunion.  Interaction with the island caused the storm to weaken and degenerate into a remnant low once more.  The storm dissipated on February 29 after executing a counterclockwise loop.",
      "2002–03 Australian region cyclone season. The 2002–03 Australian region cyclone season included Cyclone Inigo, which tied Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 as the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian basin.  It began on 1 November 2002 and ended on 30 April 2003.  The regional tropical cyclone operational plan also defines a \"tropical cyclone year\" separately from a \"tropical cyclone season\", which runs from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003.  These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Australian region, which is defined as in the southern hemisphere between 90°E and 180°E.  The season's ten tropical depressions existed within these dates, with the first, designated as Tropical Cyclone 07S, entering the basin on 27 December 2002.  The last system, Cyclone Epi, dissipated on 6 June 2003.  Tropical cyclones in this area were monitored by four Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs): the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) in Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane and one in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.",
      "2010–11 South Pacific cyclone season. The 2010–11 South Pacific cyclone season was a slightly below average tropical cyclone season, with seven tropical cyclones and five severe tropical cyclones developing during the season.  The season ran from November 1, 2010 until April 30, 2011, though if any tropical cyclones had developed between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011, the official \"tropical cyclone year\", they would have been counted towards the season's total.  Within the South Pacific basin tropical cyclones were officially monitored by the Fiji Meteorological Service's Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji, north of 25°S, and to the south the Meteorological Service of New Zealand's Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand.  Any disturbances forming in the region were designated with a sequential number suffixed by the letter F.  In addition, the United States Military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center unofficially monitored parts of the basin during the season, where any systems judged to have achieved tropical storm strength or greater received a number suffixed with the letter P. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measure wind speeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over a period of one minute which can be applied to the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.  Seven named storms formed or moved into the South Pacific basin during the 2010–11 season, the strongest of which was Severe Tropical Cyclone Wilma in late January.",
      "2011–12 South Pacific cyclone season. The 2011–12 South Pacific cyclone season was one of the least active South Pacific tropical cyclone seasons on record, with only three tropical cyclones occurring during the season.  The season ran from November 1, 2011 to April 30, 2012, however, any tropical cyclones that form before June 30, 2012 would have fallen within the 2011–12 tropical cyclone year and would have counted towards the season total.  The strongest and only severe tropical cyclone that occurred during the season was Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasmine, which tracked in from out of the South Pacific basin.  Within the basin, tropical cyclones are monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand.  RSMC Nadi attaches an F designation to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the South Pacific.  The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues unofficial warnings within the South Pacific, designating tropical storm-equivalent or greater tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix.  RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measure windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over a period of one minute and uses the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale."
