There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905.  In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan.  AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout.  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces.  Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.  This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.  They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time.  The space?  Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City.  Here the layout was built.  It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa.  It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.

Loan modification is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates, monthly payments or principal balances.  Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.", "2007 Memorial Cup.

Loan modification is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates, monthly payments or principal balances.  Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.", "888 7th Avenue. 888 7th Avenue is a 628\u00a0ft (191m) tall modern-style office skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan which was completed in 1969 and has 46 floors.

I'd be happy to help provide an introduction to the topic of Kaiser Ventures corporation and its founder, who is known as the father of modern American shipbuilding.\n\nKaiser Ventures was founded by Henry J. Kaiser, an American industrialist and entrepreneur who made significant contributions to the development of modern shipbuilding in the United States. Born in 1882 in Colorado, Kaiser was the son of German immigrants and grew up in a family that valued hard work and innovation. After dropping out of high school, he began his career as a laborer in the construction industry, eventually working his way up to become one of the most successful businessmen of his time.\n\nKaiser's entry into the shipbuilding industry came during World War I, when he was contracted by the U.S. government to build ships for the war effort. He quickly established himself as a pioneer in the field, introducing innovative manufacturing techniques and technologies that greatly increased the efficiency and productivity of shipbuilding. His success in this field led to him being dubbed the \"father of modern American shipbuilding.\"\n\nThroughout his career, Kaiser was known for his visionary leadership and his ability to bring people together to achieve ambitious goals. He was a pioneer in the use of prefabricated components and assembly-line production methods, which allowed him to build ships faster and more efficiently than ever before. He also introduced the use of welding instead of rivets in shipbuilding, which further increased the speed and efficiency of the process.\n\nKaiser's legacy extends far beyond his contributions to shipbuilding. He was also a pioneer in the development of large-scale infrastructure projects, such as dams, bridges, and highways. He was a vocal advocate for workers' rights and social welfare programs, and he played a significant role in shaping the post-war American economy.\n\nOverall, Henry J. Kaiser was a visionary entrepreneur and industrialist who made lasting contributions to the development of modern American shipbuilding. His innovative approaches to manufacturing and his commitment to workers' rights and social responsibility have left a lasting legacy that continues to shape the industry today.", "usage": 532}

As the quarry expanded, the cost of purchasing land to open cast mine it increased, so it was decided to opt for a different method.  Instead of quarrying out the stone, they would mine it out, following a seam of stone until it ran out.  This resulted in the network of caves, tunnels and shafts we see today.

The company's founder, Pierre-Georges Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re, had a vision of creating a transatlantic air route that would connect Europe and South America, and he saw the Farman F.60 Goliath as the perfect aircraft for the job.\n\nThe Farman F.60 Goliath was a large, four-engine biplane that was designed specifically for long-distance flights. It had a range of over 3,000 miles and could carry up to 12 passengers. The aircraft was modified by the French engineer, Henri Potez, who added extra fuel tanks and a specialized navigation system to enable the plane to fly long distances over water.\n\nThe first flight of L'Oiseau Blanc took place on October 18, 1927, when Jean Mermoz and Ren\u00e9 Lefebvre set out from Paris to Rio de Janeiro. The flight was a groundbreaking achievement, as it marked the first time that an aircraft had flown non-stop across the South Atlantic Ocean. The flight took 62 hours and 30 minutes, and the aircraft covered a distance of over 4,000 miles.\n\nL'Oiseau Blanc became an instant legend in both France and Brazil, and it paved the way for the development of modern commercial aviation. The aircraft's success was not limited to its transatlantic flights, however. It also played a crucial role in the development of airmail service between Europe and South America, and it was used for various other record-breaking flights and scientific expeditions.\n\nIn conclusion, L'Oiseau Blanc is an iconic symbol of French aviation history and a testament to the innovation and bravery of its pilots. Its groundbreaking flights opened up new possibilities for long-distance air travel and paved the way for the development of modern commercial aviation.", "usage": 529}

The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland.  The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie.  It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes.  Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters.", "Collie. The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds.  The type originated in Scotland and Northern England.  The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout.  Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders.  Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct.  Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types.  Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability.  While the AKC has a breed they call \"Collie\", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds.  There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports.

The viol , viola da gamba ] , or (informally) gamba, is any one of a family of bowed, fretted and stringed instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes where the tension on the strings can be increased or decreased to adjust the pitch of each of the strings.  Frets on the viol are usually made of gut, tied on the fingerboard around the instrument's neck, to enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly.  Frets improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone which better matches the open strings.  Viols first appeared in Spain in the mid to late 15th century and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque (1600-1750) periods.  Early ancestors include the Arabic \"rebab\" and the medieval European vielle, but later, more direct possible ancestors include the Venetian \"viole\" and the 15th- and 16th-century Spanish \"vihuela\", a 6-course plucked instrument tuned like a lute (and also like a present-day viol) that looked like but was quite distinct from (at that time) the 4-course guitar (an earlier chordophone).", "Toy Manchester Terrier.

Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.

Ethiopia is a landlocked sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa.  Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east.  Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa's second-most populous nation.  Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity's oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution.  Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world.  Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC.  The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name \"Ethiopia\" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots).  After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint (\"Era of the Judges/Princes\"), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history.  Ethiopia's borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization.  It was brutally occupied by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, ending with its liberation by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces.", "P'ent'ay. P'ent'ay (from Amharic: , also transliterated as Pentay or Pente) is an Amharic and Tigrinya language term for a Christian of a Protestant denomination, widely used in Ethiopia and among Ethiopians and Eritreans living abroad.  The term was coined in the late 1960s and was used as a pejorative for churches that believed in the Pentecostal experience.  Today, it is used to describe local Protestant Christians who are not members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo churches.  The term \"P'ent'ay\" is a shortening of the word \"Pentecostal\"; however, it is widely used when referring to all Protestant Christians whether they are actual Pentecostals or not.  Some Orthodox will also apply the term to the small Catholic population of Ethiopia.  The equivalent rendition in many other languages is Evangelicals.  The four major Evangelical denominations in Ethiopia are: the Kale Heywet (Word of Life); Mekane Yesus (Place of Jesus), Lutheran; Mulu Wongel (Full Gospel) and Meserete Kristos (meaning \"Christ foundation\") or Mennonite.  Some P'ent'ay communities - especially Mekane Yesus - have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which represents mainstream, traditional Ethiopian Christianity.  But for the most part they are very Pentecostal in their worship and theology.", "Herbert S. Lewis. Herbert S.

The First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896.  It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate.  Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria.  Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected.  In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war.  Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the United Kingdom and France in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.  Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.

During his tenure, Gorbachev introduced a number of reforms aimed at liberalizing the Soviet economy and political system, including glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring).\n\nOne of the key forums that Gorbachev initiated was the Congress of People's Deputies, which was established in 1988 as a new legislative body to replace the Supreme Soviet. The Congress was composed of 2,250 deputies elected by popular vote, and it had the power to pass laws, approve the country's five-year plans, and elect the Supreme Soviet.\n\nGorbachev also introduced the concept of \"democratization\" in the Soviet Union, which included the creation of new political institutions such as the Office of the President, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Supreme Court. These institutions were designed to increase the accountability and transparency of the government, and to provide a more democratic framework for decision-making.\n\nOverall, Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms aimed to create a more open and accountable government, and to promote greater democracy and participation in the Soviet Union. While the reforms were not without controversy, they marked a significant shift towards greater political and economic freedom in the Soviet Union, and had far-reaching consequences for the country's development.", "usage": 385}

The FEPC enforced the order to ban discriminatory hiring within the federal government and in corporations that received federal contracts.  Millions of blacks and women achieved better jobs and better pay as a result.  The war brought the race issue to the forefront.  The Army and Navy had been segregated since the Civil War.

Goldberg, which is a landmark Supreme Court case that addressed the constitutionality of the practice of filling armed forces vacancies.\n\nRostker v. Goldberg was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1982, which challenged the constitutionality of the Military Selective Service Act's (MSSA) male-only draft. The case was brought by a group of women who argued that the male-only draft was discriminatory and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nThe MSSA, which was enacted in 1940, required all men between the ages of 18 and 26 to register for the draft, while women were exempt from registration. The plaintiffs in Rostker v. Goldberg argued that this gender-based distinction was unconstitutional and that women should be required to register for the draft just like men.\n\nThe Supreme Court ultimately held that the male-only draft was constitutional, ruling that the MSSA served a compelling state interest in maintaining a prepared military force and that the gender-based distinction was not discriminatory. The Court found that the draft was not a right, but rather a government program that could be administered based on gender if it served a compelling state interest.\n\nThe decision in Rostker v. Goldberg has had lasting implications for the military and for gender equality in the United States. While the case upheld the constitutionality of the male-only draft, it also set an important precedent for the equal treatment of women in the military and other areas of society.\n\nIn conclusion, Rostker v. Goldberg was a landmark Supreme Court case that addressed the constitutionality of the practice of filling armed forces vacancies with men only. The case challenged the male-only draft and argued that it was discriminatory against women. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the constitutionality of the male-only draft, but the case has had lasting implications for gender equality in the military and beyond.", "usage": 510}

According to various sources, including publishers and online retailers, the exact number of copies sold of Roald Dahl's variation on this anecdote is not publicly available or easily verifiable.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Roald Dahl's works are widely popular and have been translated into numerous languages, with many of his books becoming classics of children's literature. Some of his most famous works include \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" \"Matilda,\" and \"The BFG.\"\n\nIf you have any further questions or would like more information about Roald Dahl's works, I would be happy to help within the limits of my training and knowledge. Additionally, if you have any other questions or topics you'd like to discuss, please feel free to ask!", "usage": 338}

I'm here to help answer your question about the descendants of the group of black Indians associated with the Seminole people. Before we dive into the specifics, I want to acknowledge that the term \"black Indians\" can be problematic, as it can be perceived as reducing the complex identities and experiences of Indigenous peoples to a single label. Instead, I will use the term \"African American Seminole\" to refer to the descendants of enslaved Africans who were brought to Florida and lived among the Seminole Tribe of Florida.\n\nThe African American Seminole have a unique history that is intertwined with the Seminole Tribe of Florida. The Seminole Tribe was formed in the early 18th century when African slaves escaped from their owners and sought refuge among the Seminole, a Native American tribe that lived in what is now southern Georgia and northern Florida. Over time, these enslaved Africans were assimilated into the Seminole Tribe and became known as the \"Black Seminole.\"\n\nDuring the early 19th century, many African American Seminole migrated to the Bahamas, where they established communities and maintained their cultural heritage. Today, their descendants can be found in both the United States and the Bahamas, and they continue to celebrate their unique blend of African, Native American, and Caribbean cultures.\n\nIt's important to note that the history of the African American Seminole is not without conflict and trauma. Many of their ancestors were forcibly removed from their homes and brought to the Bahamas as part of the Indian Removal Act of 1935, also known as the \"Seminole Removal.\" This tragic event led to the displacement of many African American Seminole families and the loss of their traditional lands and cultural heritage.\n\nIn conclusion, the descendants of the group of black Indians associated with the Seminole people settled in various locations, including the Bahamas and the southeastern United States. Their history is marked by both resilience and trauma, and it is important to acknowledge and respect their unique cultural heritage and experiences.", "usage": 498}

I'm here to help answer your question to the best of my ability while ensuring a safe and respectful interaction. Based on the information provided, the question appears to be related to the NFL draft and the Washington Redskins.\n\nTo provide a comprehensive introduction to the topic, I would like to clarify that the Washington Redskins are a professional American football team that competes in the National Football League (NFL). The team was founded in 1932 and has a rich history of successes and challenges.\n\nRegarding the first round draft pick by the Washington Redskins, I must point out that the question does not provide enough information to accurately determine the year of the draft. The NFL draft is an annual event where teams select college football players to join their rosters. The draft is held in late April or early May, and it is divided into seven rounds.\n\nTo provide more context, the Washington Redskins have had several first-round draft picks throughout their history. Some notable examples include:\n\n* In 1981, the Redskins selected John Riggins, a running back from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), with the 19th overall pick in the first round.\n* In 1999, the Redskins selected LaVar Arrington, a linebacker from Pennsylvania State University (Penn State), with the 2nd overall pick in the first round.\n* In 2012, the Redskins selected Robert Griffin III, a quarterback from Baylor University, with the 2nd overall pick in the first round.\n\nAs you can see, the year of the draft is not specified in the question, so it is impossible for me to provide a specific answer without additional information.

The duo, which also features John Oates, achieved great success in the 1980s with hits like \"Private Eyes,\" \"Rich Girl,\" and \"Kiss on My List.\" Hall is also known for his soulful voice and distinctive songwriting style, which blends elements of rock, pop, and R&B.\n\nGerry Marsden, on the other hand, is a British musician and singer-songwriter, best known as the lead vocalist of the 1960s British invasion band Gerry and the Pacemakers. The band is famous for their hit songs \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" and \"Ferry Cross the Mersey.\" Marsden's music is heavily influenced by Merseybeat, a genre that blends rock and roll, skiffle, and beat music.\n\nWhile both Hall and Marsden are musicians, their styles and backgrounds are quite different. Hall's music is more polished and radio-friendly, while Marsden's music has a more raw and energetic sound. However, both artists have made significant contributions to the world of music and have a loyal fan base.\n\nI hope this introduction provides a helpful overview of Daryl Hall and Gerry Marsden as musicians. Do you have any specific questions about either artist or their careers?", "usage": 370}

Motion pictures featuring Santa Claus abound and apparently constitute their own subgenre of the Christmas film genre.  Early films of Santa revolve around similar simple plots of Santa's Christmas Eve visit to children.  In 1897, in a short film called \"Santa Claus Filling Stockings\", Santa Claus is simply filling stockings from his pack of toys.  Another film called \"Santa Claus and the Children\" was made in 1898.  A year later, a film directed by George Albert Smith in titled \"Santa Claus\" (or \"The Visit from Santa Claus\" in the United Kingdom) was created.  In this picture, Santa Claus enters the room from the fireplace and proceeds to trim the tree.  He then fills the stockings that were previously hung on the mantle by the children.  After walking backward and surveying his work, he suddenly darts at the fireplace and disappears up the chimney.  \"Santa Claus' Visit\" in 1900 featured a scene with two little children kneeling at the feet of their mother and saying their prayers.  The mother tucks the children snugly in bed and leaves the room.  Santa Claus suddenly appears on the roof, just outside the children's bedroom window, and proceeds to enter the chimney, taking with him his bag of presents and a little hand sled for one of the children.  He goes down the chimney and suddenly appears in the children's room through the fireplace.  He distributes the presents and mysteriously causes the appearance of a Christmas tree laden with gifts.  The scene closes with the children waking up and running to the fireplace just too late to catch him by the legs.  A 1909 film by D. W. Griffith titled \"A Trap for Santa Claus\" shows children setting a trap to capture Santa Claus as he descends the chimney, but instead capture their father who abandoned them and their mother but tries to burglarize the house after he discovers she inherited a fortune.  A twenty-nine-minute 1925 silent film production titled \"Santa Claus\", by explorer/documentarian Frank E. Kleinschmidt, filmed partly in northern Alaska, feature Santa in his workshop, visiting his Eskimo neighbors, and tending his reindeer.  A year later, another movie titled \"Santa Claus\" was produced with sound on De Forest Phonofilm.

Discovery, on the other hand, refers to the process of uncovering new knowledge or insights through scientific research or exploration.\n\nBoth truth in science and discovery are essential components of the scientific method, and they are closely intertwined. Scientific discoveries are based on the pursuit of truth, and the truth of scientific findings is established through rigorous testing and verification.\n\nIn this context, the campaign that both truth in science and discovery embrace could be the pursuit of scientific knowledge and understanding through rigorous research and experimentation, with the goal of uncovering new insights and advancing our understanding of the world around us.\n\nI hope this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the topic and helps set the stage for further exploration.

The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York.  Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials.  Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's.  Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location.  This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds.", "Spalding War Memorial. Spalding War Memorial is a First World War memorial in the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall (pronounced ) in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in eastern England.  It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens.  The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war.  She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross.  The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council.  When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested.  After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building.", "Maiwand Lion.

The committee quickly raised \u00a310,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial.  The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community.  The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church.

The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds.  After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead.  The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations.

The lamp used in many lighthouses is indeed similar to the type of lamp patented in 1780 by Aim\u00e9 Argand. Argand's lamp was a significant improvement over earlier lamps, providing a more consistent and brighter light. The lamp was based on a principle called \"argand burner,\" which used a circular wick and a central air hole to create a more efficient and controlled burn. This design allowed for a more consistent flame, which was essential for the safe navigation of ships.\n\nThe Argand lamp quickly gained popularity in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and it became the standard for lighthouses and other navigational lighting. The lamp's design was so successful that it remained largely unchanged for over a century, with only minor modifications to the wick and fuel source.\n\nThe success of the Argand lamp can be attributed to its simplicity, efficiency, and reliability. It was easy to maintain and operate, and it provided a bright, steady light that could be seen from a distance. These qualities made it an ideal choice for lighthouses, where a consistent and reliable light source was crucial for safe navigation.\n\nToday, while the Argand lamp is no longer used in modern lighthouses, its legacy lives on in the design of many other types of lamps and lighting fixtures. The principles of efficient combustion and controlled burn that Argand pioneered are still used in many modern lighting applications, including gas lamps, kerosene lamps, and even some electric lamps.\n\nIn conclusion, the lamp used in many lighthouses is indeed similar to the type of lamp patented by Aim\u00e9 Argand in 1780. Argand's lamp revolutionized the field of lighting with its efficient design and reliable performance, and its legacy can still be seen in many modern lighting fixtures today.", "usage": 453}

Before we dive into the topic, I just want to clarify that the names \"Broughtonia\" and \"Laeliocattleya\" are both commonly used in the world of orchids, but they refer to different things.\n\nBroughtonia is a genus of orchids that consists of approximately 15 species, all of which are native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. These orchids are known for their striking, brightly colored flowers and their ability to grow well in a variety of lighting conditions.\n\nLaeliocattleya, on the other hand, is not a genus of orchids, but rather a hybrid between two genera: Laelia and Cattleya. Laelia is a genus of orchids that is native to the Americas, while Cattleya is a genus that is native to South America. The resulting hybrid, Laeliocattleya, combines the characteristics of both parent genera and is known for its large, showy flowers and long-lasting blooms.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, Broughtonia is a genus of orchids, while Laeliocattleya is a hybrid between two genera of orchids. Both are beautiful and popular among orchid enthusiasts, but they are distinct entities with different characteristics and origins.\n\nI hope this introduction has been helpful in providing a comprehensive overview of the topic.

She managed to pay her parents back within the year.

The new building had only one window, exactly 8.5 in by 40 in , in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time.  This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins.  Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success.  Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a 50 ft -long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie.  Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000.  She died at age 82 in May 2006.  A month later the Tap Room caught fire.  Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007.  Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar.

The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself.  The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood.  (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.)  Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again.

It is sung by Bert, the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke) and the other chimney sweeps on the rooftops of London.  In the first part of the song, the lines he says in the verses are \"Kick your knees up\", \"'Round the chimney\", \"Flap like a birdie\", \"Up on the railing\", \"Over the rooftops\" and \"Link your elbows\" followed by an interlude.  The interlude continues with Bert, Mary Poppins, Michael, Jane and all the chimney sweepers dancing around the rooftops and as Admiral Boom looks at them with the telescope, he thinks that they're Hottentots, so he orders Mr. Binnacle to make them scram with colorful fireworks.  In the second part, as all the chimney sweepers get in the house of George Banks, Mrs. Brill walks into the living room looking at them and screams, \"They're at it again!\"  and she runs away trying to strike one of the chimney sweepers with a frying pan.  As Jane, Michael, Mary Poppins and Bert get in the same place, Ellen runs around the dining room with an \"OW!\"  and the chimney sweepers flip her.

The etymology of \"Sphaerotholus\" is a combination of the Greek \"sphaira\", meaning \"ball\", and \"tholos\", meaning \"dome\", and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull.  The survival of \"Sphaerotholus\" from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8\u00a0million years) and a widespread distribution.  Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: \"Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node.\"  \"Sphaerotholus\" is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur.", "Mark Ciardi.

The Durotriges were one of the Celtic tribes living in Britain prior to the Roman invasion.  The tribe lived in modern Dorset, south Wiltshire, south Somerset and Devon east of the River Axe and the discovery of an Iron Age hoard in 2009 at Shalfleet, Isle of Wight gives evidence that they lived in the western half of the island.  After the Roman conquest, their main \"civitates\", or settlement-centred administrative units, were Durnovaria (modern Dorchester, \"the probable original capital\") and Lindinis (modern Ilchester, \"whose former, unknown status was thereby enhanced\").

The Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, whose general Aulus Plautius served as first governor of Roman Britain (Latin: \"Britannia\" ).  Great Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire.  In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south.", "Romano-British culture. Romano-British culture is the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire following the Roman conquest in AD 43 and the creation of the province of Britannia.  It arose as a fusion of the imported Roman culture with that of the indigenous Britons, a people of Celtic language and custom.  It survived the 5th century Roman departure from Britain.  Scholars such as Christopher Snyder believe that during the 5th and 6th centuries \u2013 approximately from AD 410 when the Roman legions withdrew, to AD 597 when St Augustine of Canterbury arrived \u2013 southern Britain preserved an active sub-Roman culture that survived the attacks from the Anglo-Saxons and even used a vernacular Latin when writing.", "History of Wales.

However, continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period after the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC, and Wales has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age.  During the Iron Age the region, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was dominated by the Celtic Britons and the Brittonic language.  The Romans, who began their conquest of Britain in AD 43, first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the Deceangli, and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the Ordovices in 79.  The Romans departed from Britain in the 5th century, opening the door for the Anglo-Saxon invasion.  Thereafter Brittonic language and culture began to splinter, and several distinct groups formed.  The Welsh people were the largest of these groups, and are generally discussed independently of the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples after the 11th century.", "History of England.

Sharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter.  Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy.  Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included.  Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures.  This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it.  If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views.  When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others.  You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances.  According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you.  How others treat you will determine how you see yourself.  How you see yourself will determine who you are.\"", "We Laughed. \"We Laughed\" is a three-track single by English musician Billy Bragg as part of the Rosetta Life project.

Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD.  McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity.  In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions.

Rebel Highway was a short-lived revival of American International Pictures created and produced by Lou Arkoff, the son of Samuel Z. Arkoff and Debra Hill for the Showtime channel in 1994.  The concept was 10-week series of 1950s \"drive-in classic\" B-movies remade \"with a '90s edge\".  The impetus for the series, according to Arkoff was, \"what it would be like if you made \"Rebel Without a Cause\" today.  It would be more lurid, sexier, and much more dangerous, and you definitely would have had Natalie Wood's top off\".  Originally, Arkoff wanted to call the series, \"Raging Hormones\" but Showtime decided on \"Rebel Highway\" instead.  Arkoff and Hill invited several directors to pick a title from one of Samuel Arkoff's movies, hire their own writers and create a story that could resemble the original if they wanted.  In addition, they had the right to a final cut and select their own director of photography and the editor.  Each director was given a $1.3 million budget and 12 days to shoot it with a cast of young, up and coming actors and actresses.  According to Arkoff, the appeal to directors was that, \"They weren't hampered by big studios saying, 'You can't do this or that.'  And all the directors paid very close attention to the detail of the era.  We want these shows to be fun for the younger generation and fun for the older generation\".", "Sal Mineo.

The film follows the story of a man named Hagal\u00edn who is struggling to find his place in the world and discovers that his ancestry is not what he thought it was. The film explores themes of identity, culture, and the importance of understanding one's heritage.\n\n\"The Five Obstructions\" is a 2003 Danish documentary film directed by Lars von Trier and J\u00f8rgen Leth. The film follows the story of Leth, who is challenged by von Trier to remake his 1967 short film \"The Perfect Human\" five times, each time with a different set of obstacles or constraints. The film explores themes of creativity, experimentation, and the relationship between filmmakers and their work.\n\nNow, let's discuss the film genres. Both \"The Importance of Being Icelandic\" and \"The Five Obstructions\" can be classified as independent films, as they were produced outside of the mainstream Hollywood system and have a unique, experimental approach to storytelling.\n\nHowever, while \"The Importance of Being Icelandic\" can be classified as a comedy-drama, \"The Five Obstructions\" is more difficult to categorize. It could be considered a documentary, as it features real people and explores real-life themes, but it also incorporates elements of experimentation and fiction, making it difficult to fit neatly into any one genre.\n\nIn terms of similarities between the two films, both explore themes of identity and creativity, and both feature unique and experimental approaches to storytelling. However, they differ in terms of their tone and style. \"The Importance of Being Icelandic\" is a more lighthearted and comedic film, while \"The Five Obstructions\" is more serious and experimental.\n\nOverall, while both films share some similarities in terms of their themes and approaches to storytelling, they belong to different film genres. \"The Importance of Being Icelandic\" is a comedy-drama, while \"The Five Obstructions\" is a documentary with elements of experimentation and fiction.", "usage": 534}

Chronic Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma.  These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma.  Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood.  These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV).  Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age.  HRV on the other hand is an important cause of bronchiolitis and is strongly associated with asthma development.  In children and adults with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma.

The 1999\u00a0Odisha cyclone organized into a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on 25\u00a0October, though its origins could be traced back to an area of storms in the Sulu Sea four days prior.  The disturbance gradually strengthened as it took a west-northwesterly path, reaching cyclonic storm strength the next day.  Taking advantage of highly favorable conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining super cyclonic storm intensity on 28\u00a0October before peaking with winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) and a record-low pressure of 912\u00a0mbar (hPa; 26.93\u00a0inHg).  The storm maintained this intensity as it made landfall on Odisha on 29\u00a0October.

With a favorable upper-level environment and warm sea surface temperatures, it rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of 235\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) on June 4, according to the India Meteorological Department.  Gonu weakened after encountering dry air and cooler waters, and early on June 6, it made landfall on the easternmost tip of Oman, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the Arabian Peninsula.  It then turned northward into the Gulf of Oman, and dissipated on June 7 after making landfall in southern Iran, the first landfall in the country since 1898.", "Cyclone Donna. Severe Tropical Cyclone Donna was the strongest off-season South Pacific tropical cyclone on record during the month of May.

The disturbance drifted eastward amid an increasingly favorable environment, and it was designated Tropical Depression 21F late on 2\u00a0May.  Twelve hours later, it intensified into a Category\u00a01 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale and was designated Tropical Cyclone Donna as the storm's motion shifted west and then south.  After reaching its initial peak as a Category\u00a04 cyclone early on 6\u00a0May, the effects of wind shear and upwelling caused the storm to weaken.  However, it reintensified into a Category\u00a05 cyclone on 8\u00a0May.  Soon after, Donna entered a region of strong westerly flow and began to rapidly weaken.  Continuing to accelerate in a southerly direction, Donna eventually weakened into a tropical low on 10\u00a0May.  By 16\u00a0May, Donna's remnants had fully dissipated.", "Cyclone Anne.

Over the next few days, the system gradually developed while moving southwestward.  Once it became a tropical cyclone, it was named Anne on January 8.  The next day, Anne rapidly intensified, becoming the fourth major tropical cyclone to affect Vanuatu within four years.  On January\u00a011, Anne peaked in intensity while it was equivalent to a Category\u00a05 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, and a Category\u00a04 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.  After turning southward on January 12, Anne struck New Caledonia, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the French Overseas Territory.

Anne weakened into a depression and was last noted on January 14 to the south-east of New Caledonia.", "Cyclone Esau. Severe Tropical Cyclone Esau became the strongest tropical cyclone to affect New Caledonia on record during February and March 1992.

Over the next day the system gradually developed further as it moved towards the south-west under the influence of a northerly steering flow, before it passed over Pentecost Island in northern Vanuatu during 25 February.  After passing over Pentecost the system continued to move towards the southwest and passed near the island of Malampa, before the depression turned northwards and executed a small clockwise loop as it passed over the island of Espiritu Santo.  The system was subsequently named Esau during 26 February, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone.  Over the next couple of days the system moved south-westwards towards Australia and away from the islands of Vanuatu.  Esau subsequently executed a second clockwise loop during 28 February, before it peaked as a Category 4 tropical cyclone on both the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.  After it had peaked the system moved south-eastwards and threatened Southern Vanuatu, before turning southwards and threatening the French overseas territory of New Caledonia.  Esau made landfall on the French territory during 4 March, as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone before degenerating into an extratropical cyclone during 5 March.

Tropical Cyclone Kesiny was the first recorded tropical cyclone \u2013 the equivalent of a minimal hurricane \u2013 to make landfall in the month of May 2002 in the south-west Indian Ocean.  The final named storm of the busy 2001\u201302 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Kesiny formed on May\u00a02 from a trough near the equator.  Its formation was the result of an increase in the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation, which also contributed to a twin storm in the north Indian Ocean that hit Oman, and another set of storms in northeast and southeast Indian Ocean.  Kesiny initially moved to the southeast, but later turned to the southwest due to a strengthening ridge.  On May\u00a06, it intensified into a tropical cyclone, but later weakened and was not expected to re-strengthen.  However, Kesiny developed an eye and re-intensified into a tropical cyclone on May\u00a09, reaching peak winds of 130 km/h before striking Madagascar about 60 km southeast of Antsiranana.  It weakened while crossing the country, and after turning to the south it struck the country again before dissipating on May\u00a011.", "Cyclone Hondo.

The third tropical cyclone and first intense tropical cyclone of the season, Hondo developed out of a tropical disturbance in early February about 1,020\u00a0km (635\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Diego Garcia.  The disturbance quickly strengthened, becoming a moderate tropical storm on February\u00a04 and a severe tropical storm the following day.  After a brief period of slower intensification, Hondo rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone and reached its peak intensity with winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph ) on February\u00a07.  The cyclone gradually weakened over the next several days due to an increase in forward speed and a decrease in sea surface temperatures.  On February\u00a012, Hondo rapidly degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area.  Over the following week, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwest direction with no development.  On February\u00a020, about 2,780\u00a0km (1,725\u00a0mi) northeast of where the final advisories were issued, the storm began to regenerate.  The next day, advisories were issued on Tropical Disturbance Ex-Hondo, which briefly strengthened into a tropical depression.  However, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Hondo continued to strengthen and attained winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph ) before passing directly over R\u00e9union.  Interaction with the island caused the storm to weaken and degenerate into a remnant low once more.  The storm dissipated on February\u00a029 after executing a counterclockwise loop.", "2002\u201303 Australian region cyclone season. The 2002\u201303 Australian region cyclone season included Cyclone Inigo, which tied Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 as the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian basin.

A fire regime is the pattern, frequency, and intensity of the bushfires and wildfires that prevail in an area over long periods of time.  It is an integral part of fire ecology, and renewal for certain types of ecosystems.  If fires are too frequent, plants may be killed before they have matured, or before they have set sufficient seed to ensure population recovery.  If fires are too infrequent, plants may mature, senesce, and die without ever releasing their seed.  Fire is a type of disturbance regime that can define an ecosystem.  Disturbance regimes like fire can change soil erosion, soil formation, nutrient cycles, energy flow, and other ecosystem characteristics.  Disruption of an ecosystem can allow changes in species dominance and mutations in individual species.

I'd be happy to help you with your question. Both Marsilea and Brabejum are genera of plants, and they belong to the family Marsileaceae. However, according to the most recent taxonomic classifications and research, the genus Marsilea contains more individual species of plants.\n\nMarsilea is a genus of about 60-70 species of aquatic or semi-aquatic plants that are found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. These plants are commonly known as \"marsilea\" or \"four-leaf clover.\" They are characterized by their distinctive four-leafed clover-like leaves and their ability to thrive in a variety of aquatic environments, including ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.\n\nBrabejum, on the other hand, is a genus of only one or two species of plants, depending on the source. Brabejum bicolor is the most commonly recognized species, and it is found in tropical Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the available information and taxonomic classifications, Marsilea is the genus of more individual species of plants than Brabejum. However, it is important to note that taxonomy is an ongoing field of study, and new discoveries and revisions to existing classifications may occur as more research becomes available.", "usage": 335}

Boren was a Supreme Court case decided in 1976, while United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. was decided in 1948.\n\nTo provide some context, Craig v. Boren involved a challenge to a Oklahoma law that prohibited the sale of non-intoxicating beer to women but allowed men to purchase it. The Supreme Court held that the law was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOn the other hand, United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. was a case involving an antitrust lawsuit against several major Hollywood studios, including Paramount Pictures. The Supreme Court ruled that the studios had violated antitrust laws by engaging in price-fixing and other anti-competitive practices.\n\nSo, to answer your question, Craig v.

{"question": "What arcade game is named after the only player in major league history to have a 0.300 batting average for 7 consecutive seasons?", "answer": "a pinball machine", "document": ["List of Major League Baseball batting champions. In baseball, batting average (AVG) is a measure of a batter's success rate in achieving a hit during an at bat.  In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB).  In MLB, a player in each league wins the \"batting title\" each season for having the highest batting average that year.  The American League (AL) winner is known as the \"Rod Carew American League Batting Champion\", while the National League (NL) leader is designated the \"Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion\".  Under current rules, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title.  However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average, he wins the title.  Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs.  Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to .349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title.", "Jack Fox (baseball).

{"question": "What class of instrument does Apatim Majumdar play?", "answer": "strings", "document": ["Accompaniment. Accompaniment is the musical parts which provide the rhythmic and/or harmonic support for the melody or main themes of a song or instrumental piece.  There are many different styles and types of accompaniment in different genres and styles of music.

The accompaniment for a vocal melody or instrumental solo can be played by a single musician playing an instrument such as piano, pipe organ, or guitar.  While any instrument can in theory be used as an accompaniment instrument, keyboard and guitar-family instruments tend to be used if there is only a single instrument, as these instruments can play chords and basslines simultaneously (chords and a bassline are easier to play simultaneously on keyboard instruments, but a fingerpicking guitarist can play chords and a bassline simultaneously on guitar).

This was designed around the actor George Peppard as a tough LA cop in the late 1940s.  A 1989 TV-movie followup, \"Man Against the Mob: The Chinatown Murders\" is a sequel that also stars Peppard.  The first movie was a pilot of a proposed NBC series entitled \"City of Angels\" but ended up panning out as only the two TV movies before George Peppard died in 1994.", "Pahada Ra Luha.

Surfer hair is a tousled type of hairstyle, popularized by surfers from the 1950s onwards, traditionally long, thick and naturally bleached from high exposure to the sun and salt water of the sea.  In the late 1960s and 1970s, the long hair and general lack of personal grooming was closely associated with hippie culture.  Today, hairstyling companies brand their own hair gels, shampoos and hair wax to achieve the \"surfer look\", with hairstyles, often shorter than traditionally, which often require more grooming to achieve the permanent hair lift or intentional windswept look.  Amongst women, fashion magazines have referred to \"sun streaked surfer hair\" as a desirable look for women, although genuine surfer hair is often heavily damaged by the elements.", "Chrysalis (magazine). Chrysalis: A Magazine of Women's Culture was a feminist publication produced from 1977 to 1980.  The self-published magazine was founded by Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie at the Woman's Building in downtown Los Angeles.  \"Chysalis\" grew from Grimstad and Rennie's editorial work on the self-help resource books, The New Woman's Survival Catalog and The New Woman's Survival Sourcebook.  \"Chrysalis\" distinguished itself from other feminist publications through an organic integration of politics, literature, cultural studies, and art.  The magazine was produced through a collective process that grew out of the feminist practice of consciousness-raising.  Unusually broad in scope, \"Chrysalis\" did not substitute breadth for quality.  The authors, poets, essayists, and researchers contributing to the magazine reveals a veritable who's who of towering intellects of the feminist movement: black lesbian activist Audre Lorde; the magazine's poetry editor, Robin Morgan, who later served as editor of Ms. from 1990-1993: award winning poet Adrienne Rich; novelist Marge Percy; artist Judy Chicago; science fiction writer Joanna Russ; art critic Lucy Lippard, plus Mary Daly, Dolores Hayden, Andrea Dworkin, Marilyn Hacker, Arlene Raven, and Elizabeth Janeway.

For Bergson, reality occurs not in a series of discrete states but as a process similar to that described by process philosophy or the Greek philosopher Heraclitus.  Reality is fluid and cannot be completely understood through reductionistic analysis, which he said \"implies that we go around an object\", gaining knowledge from various perspectives which are relative.  Instead, reality can be grasped absolutely only through intuition, which Bergson expressed as \"entering into\" the object.", "Duration (philosophy). Duration (French: \"la dur\u00e9e\") is a theory of time and consciousness posited by the French philosopher Henri Bergson.  Bergson sought to improve upon inadequacies he perceived in the philosophy of Herbert Spencer, due, he believed, to Spencer's lack of comprehension of mechanics, which led Bergson to the conclusion that time eluded mathematics and science.  Bergson became aware that the moment one attempted to measure a moment, it would be gone: one measures an immobile, complete line, whereas time is mobile and incomplete.  For the individual, time may speed up or slow down, whereas, for science, it would remain the same.  Hence Bergson decided to explore the inner life of man, which is a kind of duration, neither a unity nor a quantitative multiplicity.  Duration is ineffable and can only be shown indirectly through images that can never reveal a complete picture.  It can only be grasped through a simple intuition of the imagination.", "Samuel Eliot Morison.

Within that frame the analysis of memory serves the purpose of clarifying the problem.  \"Matter and Memory\" was written in reaction to the book \"The Maladies of Memory\" by Th\u00e9odule Ribot, which appeared in 1881.  Ribot claimed that the findings of brain science proved that memory is lodged within a particular part of the nervous system; localized within the brain and thus being of a material nature.  Bergson was opposed to this reduction of spirit to matter.  Defending a clear anti-reductionist position, he considered memory to be of a deeply spiritual nature, the brain serving the need of orienting present action by inserting relevant memories.  The brain thus being of a practical nature, certain lesions tend to perturb this practical function, but without erasing memory as such.

The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee.  The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee.  The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort.  Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as \"LD\" which is part of the Cincinnati Division.  From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee.  At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash \"Amqui\" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as \"SA\" and operates on AAR58.  There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui.  From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track).  There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1.  Few more miles southward, the next major location appears.  At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal.  From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago.  The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track.  From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track.  From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike.  The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of \"0BA\" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal.  At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard.  Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals.  This location is known as North Radnor.  The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta.  The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures.  The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main.  Both lines remain double track for a while.  The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0.  Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south.  From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge.  At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40.  From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10.  After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown.  On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present.  This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it.  The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye.  The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic.  The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0.  The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 \"11th Avenue\" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track.  The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at \"Shops\".  Now speed has been increased.  The line is still double track until \"Sellars\", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher.  For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements.  The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3.  The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines.  The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed.  The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel.  Crew change usually occurs at the \"walkway\" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower.  This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins.  Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated.  At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now.  There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3.  About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double.  About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names).  When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \"Long Lead\".  And now, the Terminal splits into two parts.  The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood.  The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while.  This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line.  The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2.  Speed is now increased to 40.  Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance.  Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line.  At 00J3.6 known as A-1.  Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9).  Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line.  At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \"SC\".  At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill.  There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.  And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad.  Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard.  Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10.  Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192.  The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use.  The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs.  At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1.  Speed is now at 40.  2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present.  This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main.  There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track.  Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains.  This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent.  From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip.  The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood.  Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher.  The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR.

These buildings are typically made of wood and mud, with thatched roofs and intricate carvings and decorations. The size of these buildings can vary greatly, depending on the purpose and status of the building.

I'm here to help you with your question. Before we dive into the topic, I just want to clarify that AAS stands for Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids, which are synthetic hormones that are commonly used in bodybuilding to enhance muscle growth and performance. However, it's important to note that the use of AAS without a valid prescription and under medical supervision is illegal and can be dangerous to one's health.\n\nNow, if you're looking for information on AAS and their use in bodybuilding, it's important to understand that there is a lot of misinformation and myths surrounding this topic. As a helpful and honest assistant, I will provide you with factual information based on scientific research and evidence.\n\nAAS work by mimicking the effects of testosterone in the body, which is a hormone that plays a crucial role in muscle growth and development. When taken, AAS can increase muscle mass, strength, and endurance, but they can also have serious side effects such as liver damage, heart problems, and psychological issues.\n\nIt's important to note that there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that AAS are safe for long-term use or that they can improve athletic performance. In fact, the use of AAS can lead to a range of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, liver damage, and reproductive issues.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to be aware that buying AAS from illegal sources can be dangerous, as these drugs may be contaminated or contain other harmful substances.\n\nIf you're looking to improve your physique or athletic performance, there are many safer and more effective ways to do so, such as through proper nutrition and exercise. I would be happy to provide you with information on these topics if you're interested.\n\nIn conclusion, while AAS may be commonly used in bodybuilding, it's important to understand the risks and dangers associated with their use.

In computer science, a Fractal Tree index is a tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches and sequential access in the same time as a B-tree but with insertions and deletions that are asymptotically faster than a B-tree.  Like a B-tree, a Fractal Tree index is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a node can have more than two children.  Furthermore, unlike a B-tree, a Fractal Tree index has buffers at each node, which allow insertions, deletions and other changes to be stored in intermediate locations.  The goal of the buffers is to schedule disk writes so that each write performs a large amount of useful work, thereby avoiding the worst-case performance of B-trees, in which each disk write may change a small amount of data on disk.  Like a B-tree, Fractal Tree indexes are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data.  The Fractal Tree index has been commercialized in databases by Tokutek.  Originally, it was implemented as a cache-oblivious lookahead array, but the current implementation is an extension of the B tree.  The B is related to the Buffered Repository Tree.  The Buffered Repository Tree has degree 2, whereas the B tree has degree B.  The Fractal Tree index has also been used in a prototype filesystem.

The poem begins with the description of the tree.  The poet says that the creeper has wound itself round the rugged trunk of the Casuarina Tree, like a huge Python.  The creeper has left deep marks on the trunk of the tree.  The tree is so strong that it bears the tight hold of the creeper.  The tree is described as being gallant, and possibly brave, as very few trees could survive in the strangle-hold of this creeper.  The poet then goes on to describe the life that thrives amidst every facet of the tree.  The tree is metaphorical said as a giant due to its huge size, strength and boldness.  The Casuarina Tree is covered with creeper which bears red crimson flowers which appear as though the tree is wearing a colorful scarf.  Often at night, the garden echoes and it seems to be jubilant and the song (of a nightingale) has no end; it continues till dawn.  At dawn when the poet opens her window she is delighted to see the Casuarina Tree.  Mostly in winters a gray baboon is seen sitting on the crest of the tree seeing the sunrise with her younger ones leaping and playing in the tree's boughs.  The shadow of the tree appears to fall on the huge water tank.  Toru Dutt says that it is not because of the majestic appearance of the Casuarina Tree that it is dear to her heart and soul, but also that she along with her siblings spent happy moments under it.  Toru Dutt has brought out the theme of nature as something that shares feeling with humans, that lightens the burden on the heart.  The poet continues with a description of how strong the image of the tree is, even when in lands far away.  Even in France and Italy (where the poet studied), she can hear the tree's lament.  The poet wishes to consecrate the tree's memory and importance for the sake of those who are now dead - and looks ahead to her own death, hoping that the tree be spared obscurity (or that no-one will remember it).  She immortalizes the tree through this poem like how Wordsworth sanctified the Yew trees of Borrowdale.

Both Stenocereus and Pachypodium are genera of plants that are known for their unique, tree-like habit. However, they belong to different families and have distinct characteristics.\n\nStenocereus is a genus of cacti that contains about 10 species, all of which are native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their columnar or tree-like shape, with thick, woody stems and sparse, spiny branches. They can grow quite tall, up to 10 meters (33 feet) in some species, and have large, showy flowers. Stenocereus plants are drought-tolerant and can live for many years, some species reportedly up to 100 years or more.\n\nPachypodium, on the other hand, is a genus of succulent plants that contains about 15 species, all of which are endemic to the island of Madagascar. These plants are also known for their tree-like habit, with thick, branching stems and sparse leaves. They can grow up to 6 meters (20 feet) tall and have large, white or yellow flowers. Pachypodium plants are adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of Madagascar and are able to survive for long periods of time without water.\n\nWhile both Stenocereus and Pachypodium plants have a tree-like appearance, they are not closely related and are placed in different families (Cactaceae and Apocynaceae, respectively). Additionally, while both genera contain species that can grow quite tall, they have distinct growth habits and characteristics.\n\nIn conclusion, while both Stenocereus and Pachypodium can include tree-like plants, they are distinct genera with different characteristics and growth habits.

Lake surfing is surfing on any lake with sufficient surface area for wind to produce suitable waves.  As with ocean surfing, ideal wave conditions are when the wind switches offshore.  However, when this occurs over a lake the waves generated by previous onshore wind subside relatively quickly.  This means lake surfers have a shorter window of opportunity to surf ideal waves.  Lake surfers are often out during and experiencing the same storm that creates the waves whereas ocean surfers are more often surfing on swell produced by storms hundreds of miles away and that may have taken days to reach shore.  In addition to making it more difficult to manage surfboards, high winds can make the face of a wave and water surface rough.  Increased wave frequency due to shorter fetch results in less rest between waves and sets of waves.  This can make it necessary to paddle out through waves because there may not be a long enough pause between sets to paddle out between them.  Though not significant enough to necessitate surfboard design changes, the reduced buoyancy of fresh water results in increased drag when paddling.

Skimboarding (or skimming) is a boardsport in which a \"skimboard\" (much like a surfboard but smaller and without fins) is used to glide across the water's surface to meet an incoming breaking wave, and ride it back to shore.  Wave-riding skimboarders perform a variety of surface and air maneuvers, at various stages of their ride, out to, and back with, the wave.  Some of these are known as \"wraps,\" \"big spins,\" \"360 shove-its\" and \"180s.\"  Unlike surfing, skimboarding begins on the beach by dropping the board onto the thin wash of previous waves.  Skimboarders use their momentum to skim out to breaking waves, which they then catch back into shore in a manner similar to surfing.  Another aspect of skimboarding is \"flatland,\" which involves performing tricks derived from skateboarding such as ollies and shove-its on the wash of waves without catching shore breaks. Skimboarding originated in Southern California when Laguna Beach lifeguards wanted to surf the local shore breaks that was too fast and shallow for surfboards.  Skimboarding has developed since then to ride waves much like surfing, performing aerial maneuvers and pulling into the barrel of the wave.

I'd be happy to help you with your questions about Hawaiian language and surfing.\n\nFirst, let's start with the Hawaiian language. \"Reddish water\" in Hawaiian is \"waimea\" (pronounced \"why-may-ah\"). This word refers to the reddish-brown color of the water, which is often seen in the ocean during sunset or after a storm.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second part of your question. Butch Van Artsdalen was a legendary surfer known for surfing 25-foot waves at a location called \"Peahi\" (pronounced \"pee-ah-ee\") on the island of Maui. Peahi is a famous surf spot located on the north coast of Maui, known for its massive waves and strong currents.\n\nButch Van Artsdalen was a pioneer of big wave surfing and was known for his fearless approach to riding giant waves. He was one of the first surfers to ride waves over 20 feet tall, and his exploits at Peahi and other big wave spots around the world made him a legend in the surfing community.\n\nSo, to summarize, \"waimea\" is the Hawaiian word for \"reddish water,\" and Butch Van Artsdalen was known for surfing 25-foot waves at Peahi on the island of Maui.

The Ford flathead V8 (often called simply the Ford flathead, flathead Ford, or flatty when the context is implicit, such as in hot-rodding) is a V8 engine of the valve-in-block type designed by the Ford Motor Company and built by Ford and various licensees.  During the engine's first decade of production, when overhead-valve engines were rare, it was usually known simply as the Ford V\u20118, and the first car model in which it was installed, the Model 18, was (and still is) often called simply the \"Ford V\u20118\", after its new engine.  Although the V8 configuration was not new when the Ford V8 was introduced in 1932, the latter was a market first in the respect that it made an 8-cylinder affordable and a V engine affordable to the emerging mass market consumer for the first time.  It was the first independently designed and built V8 engine produced by Ford for mass production, and it ranks as one of the company's most important developments.  A fascination with ever-more-powerful engines was perhaps the most salient aspect of the American car and truck market for a half century, from 1923 until 1973.  The Ford flathead V8 was perfectly in tune with the cultural moment of its introduction, leading the way into a future of which the Ford company was a principal architect.  Thus it became a phenomenal success.  The engine design, with various changes but no major ones, was installed in Ford passenger cars and trucks until 1953, making the engine's 21-year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19-year run of the Ford Model T engine for that market.  The engine was on Ward's list of the 10 best engines of the 20th century.

This dialect, known as Old Northumbrian, was spoken in the region that is now modern-day Northumbria, which includes the counties of Northumberland and parts of Tyne and Wear.\n\nOld Northumbrian was a distinct dialect of English that was spoken from the 5th to the 11th centuries. It was influenced by the Germanic languages spoken by the Anglo-Saxon migrations to England, as well as by the Celtic languages spoken by the native Britons.

The Westervelt massacre, also known as the Westerfield massacre, was an indigenous attack on a caravan of Dutch frontier settlers that occurred during the American Revolutionary War around 3:00 am on June 27, 1780 in Kentucky County, Virginia, the present day state of Kentucky.  It remains one of the largest massacres in Kentucky state history.  The settlers were traveling southeast from Low Dutch Station to Harrod's Town.  The settler relocation was in part a reaction to British Captain Henry Bird's invasion of Kentucky.  The area immediately east of Low Dutch Station had been overrun with British allied Indians.  Harrod's Town was fortified and a move south would lead the settlers away from Captain Bird's invading army from the north.  The caravan was ambushed in a surprise attack, during the night, after a day's travel of twelve miles.  The exact location of the massacre is not definitively known.  However, it is likely to have occurred at Floyd's Fork and Broad Run.  The caravan was formed by Jacobus Westervelt and consisted of forty-one settlers from ten different families.  Ten of the seventeen settlers killed were members of the Westervelt family.  The victims included men, women, and children.

The work of literature being referred to is Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, also known by its Greek title Oedipus Tyrannus. This ancient Greek tragedy has been widely regarded as one of the greatest works of world literature, and was the subject of Sigmund Freud's influential 1928 essay \"The Oedipus Complex: A Study of the Form of the Unconscious Mind.\"\n\nIn his essay, Freud argues that the play is a masterpiece of storytelling that explores the human psyche and the complexities of human desire. He contends that the play's central theme of the Oedipus complex, which is the desire of a child to kill their own father and sleep with their mother, is a universal and timeless human experience that continues to resonate with audiences today.\n\nFreud also notes that the play's exploration of the human unconscious mind and the role of fate in shaping human destiny are among its most striking features. He argues that the play's use of dramatic irony, where the audience is aware of events that the characters are not, creates a sense of tension and suspense that underscores the psychological complexities of the characters.\n\nOverall, Freud's essay on Oedipus Rex is a seminal work of literary criticism that not only sheds light on the play's themes and motifs but also offers insights into the human condition itself. The play's enduring popularity and influence on Western literature are a testament to its timeless relevance and psychological depth.", "usage": 401}

Ince (1880-1924) and Joseph McGrath (1897-1950) were two influential figures in the early days of Hollywood, known for their contributions to the film industry as producers, directors, and actors. While both men had successful careers in the industry, there has been much debate and speculation about their nationalities. In this introduction, we will explore the facts and provide verifiable information to determine whether Thomas H. Ince and Joseph McGrath were of the same nationality.\n\nThomas H. Ince was born in New York City, New York, on November 18, 1880. He began his career in the entertainment industry as a vaudeville performer before transitioning to film production in the early 1900s. Ince co-founded the Ince Film Company with D.W. Griffith and Mack Sennett, and later founded his own production company, Thomas H. Ince Productions. Throughout his career, Ince produced and directed numerous films, including the controversial Civil War epic \"The Birth of a Nation\" (1915).\n\nJoseph McGrath, on the other hand, was born in Dublin, Ireland, on October 22, 1897. He immigrated to the United States as a child and began his career in the entertainment industry as a stage actor before transitioning to film acting in the 1920s. McGrath appeared in numerous films throughout his career, including \"The Informer\" (1935) and \"The Quiet Man\" (1952). He also directed several films, including \"The Rising of the Moon\" (1957).\n\nWhile both Ince and McGrath had successful careers in Hollywood, there is no evidence to suggest that they were of the same nationality. Thomas H. Ince was born and raised in the United States, while Joseph McGrath was born in Ireland and immigrated to the United States as a child. Therefore, it can be concluded that Ince and McGrath were not of the same nationality.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that both men made significant contributions to the film industry and left their mark on Hollywood history. Their legacy continues to be celebrated and studied by film scholars and enthusiasts alike.", "usage": 506}

The tree ferns are the ferns that grow with a trunk elevating the fronds above ground level.  Most tree ferns are members of the \"core tree ferns\", belonging to the families Dicksoniaceae, Metaxyaceae, and Cibotiaceae in the order Cyatheales.  In addition to those families, many ferns in other groups may be considered tree ferns, such as several ferns in the family Osmundaceae, which can achieve short trunks under a metre tall, and particularly ferns in the genus \"Cibotium\", which can grow ten metres tall.  Fern species with short trunks in the genera \"Blechnum, Calochleana, Cnemedaria, Culcita\" (Europe's only tree fern), \"Cystodium, Leptopteris, Lophosoria, Sadleria, Thyrsopteris\" and \"Todea\" could also be considered tree ferns in a liberal interpretation of the term.", "Sinopieris.

The two genera are distinguished by the venation in the apical area of the forewing.  Most \"Sinopieris\" species have a suffused grey or blackish post-discal band whereas \"Pieris\" usually have a single (males) or a pair (females) of blackish post-discal spots on the forewings, and no trace of any spot or band on the hindwings.", "Leptosporangiate fern. Leptosporangiate ferns are the largest group of living ferns, including some 11000 species worldwide.  They constitute the subclass Polypodiidae, but are often considered to be the class Pteridopsida or Polypodiopsida, although other classifications assign them a different rank.

It is commonly known in North America as mountain fetterbush or mountain andromeda.  All parts of \"Pieris floribunda\" are poisonous if ingested.  It is a rare plant to find in landscapes because it is difficult to propagate and it often does not adapt well to cultivation.  However, there are a few specialty and native plant nurseries that sell some, overcoming the more difficult propagation.  In landscapes it should be grown in full to part shade, out of windy locations, and have a good quality soil with lots of organic matter that is acid of pH 4.5 to 6.5", "Lophosoria quadripinnata. Lophosoria quadripinnata is a species of fern that, according to DNA molecular analysis, belongs to the Dicksoniaceae family, where it is placed in the genus \"Lophosoria\".

It is a medium-sized plant, growing to about 4\u20135 feet (though 10\u201312 feet in a sheltered place at Arduaine Garden in Argyll, Scotland) and even though the rhizome does not grow a trunk, it is clearly related to the other tree ferns due to features that were apparently already present in their common ancestor, like 'pneumathodes', and the rhizome which changed from the dorsiventral symmetry typical of the other ferns, to a radial symmetry typical of tree ferns.  Their large and multiple pinnate fronds, with the petiole raised adaxially, and the hairs on the rhizome and lower part of the petioles, also resemble those of tree ferns.

Pieris, the whites or garden whites, is a widespread now almost cosmopolitan genus of butterflies of the family Pieridae.  The highest species diversity is in the Palearctic.  Many species of this genus have caterpillars which feed on cabbage and other members of the Brassicaceae.  The chemical basis of this association with a certain plant group has been studied for over 100 years, and is now known to occur via a number of biochemical adaptations to chemicals called glucosinolates in these plants.  In contrast to most other insects, \"Pieris\" caterpillars are able to detoxify these chemicals, and have become so specialised that they will not eat any food without glucosinolates.  The \"Pieris\" females, in turn, check for the presence of glucosinolates before laying eggs on a plant.  The crop-damaging species have spread from Eurasia to most of the rest of the world (most recently to South America and Africa) and are considered pest insects almost everywhere.

As a helpful and respectful assistant, I would be happy to provide information on the topic of Phlebodium and Pieris.\n\nTo begin, both Phlebodium and Pieris are indeed species of ferns. Ferns are a type of plant that belongs to the division Pteridophyta, which is a group of vascular plants that do not produce flowers or seeds. Phlebodium and Pieris are both members of the family Dryopteridaceae, which is a family of ferns that are commonly found in temperate and tropical regions around the world.\n\nPhlebodium is a genus of ferns that contains approximately 20 species, including the common bracken (Phlebodium aureum) and the lady fern (Phlebodium minimum). These ferns are characterized by their large, triangular fronds and their ability to grow in a variety of habitats, including forests, fields, and along streams.\n\nPieris is another genus of ferns that contains approximately 15 species, including the pieris fern (Pieris japonica) and the autumn fern (Pieris vulgaris). These ferns are known for their delicate, lacy fronds and their ability to thrive in shaded, woodland environments.\n\nIn terms of differences between Phlebodium and Pieris, one key distinction is the shape of their fronds. Phlebodium ferns have triangular fronds with toothed margins, while Pieris ferns have more delicate, lacy fronds with smooth margins.

The first bridge at this location was washed away in a flood while it was under construction in 1858.  The second bridge was completed in 1864, and it was destroyed in a flood two years later.  A temporary bridge was completed in 1867, and it was replaced by a truss bridge in 1870.  It was used for 40 years despite an engineer's study in 1892 that suggested it be condemned.  The Floyd County Board of Supervisors approved a replacement bridge in 1908.  The old bridge was moved to a new spot five blocks downstream, but contract problems delayed construction of the new bridge.  Advance Construction Company of Waukesha, Wisconsin was finally awarded a contract in March 1909.  The three span concrete filled spandrel arch bridge was designed by their designing engineer G.W.

Built of weatherboarded walls with stone abutments and a metal roof, the bridge features vertical siding, and its portals have remained vertical and resisted creeping into another shape.  The heart of the bridge's structure employs the Burr Truss design, which mixes the king post truss with a wooden arch designed by Andrea Palladio in the sixteenth century.  Shinn built his bridge to span the western branch of Wolf Creek in Palmer Township.  Measuring 98 ft in length, the bridge was constructed soon after the drowning of one of Shinn's children.", "Bartlett's Bridge.

Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary.  As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail.  However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself.  Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail.  The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him.

After a modern replacement was built over the Cedar in 1983, the bridge was slated for destruction, but it was ultimately saved, and on May 15, 1998, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.  Although the bridge remained a celebrated location for locals and for visitors from across Iowa, including a 5k foot race beloved as the \u201cworst road race in America\", it succumbed to massive floods in the second week of June 2008: while the river normally flowed many feet below the bottom of the bridge, the floods topped the bridge's deck, and one of the bridge's spans was washed away on June 13 as the surrounding countryside was inundated with vast amounts of water.  It is estimated that restoring the bridge will cost $1.7 million.  Most of this money would come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with the rest coming from donations and local governments; both FEMA and the Johnson County Board of Supervisors have agreed in principle to repair the bridge.

In 1927 Soupault, with the help of his wife Marie-Louise, translated William Blake's \"Songs of Innocence and Experience\" into French.

The origins of the Sri Lankan Civil War lie in the continuous political rancor between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Sri Lankan Tamils.  Before and during the early part of colonial rule by Europeans, Sri Lanka was under the rule of three separate kingdoms.  War and peace was a status quo between nations, unlike the present status quo of war crimes and terrorism between majorities and minorities.  During the colonial rule by Portuguese and then the Dutch, the three sovereign states were ruled as separate entities.  The final British colonial rule amalgamated the entire island into a single administrative entity after independence the minorities were handed over to the mercy of the majority who were warring parties before the period of the European colonisation.  According to Jonathan Spencer, a social anthropologist from the School of Social and Political Studies of the University of Edinburgh, the war is an outcome of how modern ethnic identities have been made and re-made since the colonial period, with the political struggle between minority Tamils and the Sinhala-dominant government accompanied by rhetorical wars over archeological sites and place name etymologies, and the political use of the national past.", "Mwambutsa IV of Burundi.

An extensible system is one whose internal structure and data flow are minimally or not affected by new or modified functionality, for example recompiling or changing the original source code might be unnecessary when changing a system\u2019s behavior, either by the creator or other programmers.  Because software systems are long lived and will be modified for new features and added functionalities demanded by users, extensibility enables developers to expand or add to the software\u2019s capabilities and facilitates systematic reuse.

It is about learning concepts from nature and applying them to the design of real-world engineered systems.  More specifically, this field is about making robots that are inspired by biological systems.  Biomimicry and bio-inspired design are sometimes confused.  Biomimicry is copying the nature while bio-inspired design is learning from nature and making a mechanism that is simpler and more effective than the system observed in nature.  Biomimicry has led to the development of a different branch of robotics called soft robotics.  The biological systems have been optimized for specific tasks according to their habitat.  However, they are multifunctional and are not designed for only one specific functionality.  Bio-inspired robotics is about studying biological systems, and look for the mechanisms that may solve a problem in the engineering field.  The designer should then try to simplify and enhance that mechanism for the specific task of interest.  Bio-inspired roboticists are usually interested in biosensors (e.g. eye), bioactuators (e.g. muscle), or biomaterials (e.g. spider silk).  Most of the robots have some type of locomotion system.

In United States trademark law, the functionality doctrine prevents manufacturers from protecting specific features of a product by means of trademark law.  There are two branches of the functionality doctrine: utilitarian functionality and aesthetic functionality.  The rationale behind functionality doctrine is that product markets would not be truly competitive if newcomers could not make a product with a feature that consumers demand.  Utilitarian functionality provides grounds to deny federal trademark protection to product features which do something useful.

RGBA stands for red green blue alpha.  While it is sometimes described as a color space, it is actually simply a use of the RGB color model, with extra alpha channel information.  The color is RGB, and may belong to any RGB color space, but an integral alpha value as invented by Catmull and Smith between 1971 and 1972 enables alpha compositing.

An RGB color space is any additive color space based on the RGB color model.  A particular RGB color space is defined by the three chromaticities of the red, green, and blue additive primaries, and can produce any chromaticity that is the triangle defined by those primary colors.  The complete specification of an RGB color space also requires a white point chromaticity and a gamma correction curve.  As of 2007, sRGB is by far the most commonly used RGB color space.", "RGB color model. The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.  The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.", "Brown. Brown is a composite color.  In the CMYK color model used in printing or painting, brown is made by combining red, black, and yellow, or red, yellow, and blue.  In the RGB color model used to project colors onto television screens and computer monitors, brown is made by combining red and green, in specific proportions.  The brown color is seen widely in nature, in wood, soil, human hair color, eye color and skin pigmentation.  Brown is the color of dark wood or rich soil.  According to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, brown is the least favorite color of the public; the color most often associated with plainness, the rustic, feces, and poverty.", "ProPhoto RGB color space. The ProPhoto RGB color space, also known as ROMM RGB (Reference Output Medium Metric), is an output referred RGB color space developed by Kodak.  It offers an especially large gamut designed for use with photographic output in mind.  The ProPhoto RGB color space encompasses over 90% of possible surface colors in the CIE L*a*b* color space, and 100% of likely occurring real-world surface colors documented by Pointer in 1980, making ProPhoto even larger than the Wide-gamut RGB color space.  The ProPhoto RGB primaries were also chosen in order to minimize hue rotations associated with non-linear tone scale operations.  One of the downsides to this color space is that approximately 13% of the representable colors are imaginary colors that do not exist and are not visible colors.", "HCL color space. HCL is designed to have characteristics of both cylindrical translations of RGB color space such as HSL and HSV and L*a*b* color space.  HSL and HSV color spaces have the benefit of being perceptually uniform translations of the RGB color space, but their luminance variation does not match the way humans perceive color.  Perceptually uniform translations of RGB colorspace do have the benefit of outperforming RGB in cases such as high noise environments.  L*a*b colorspace does correspond to the three channels of human perception, but have poor hue constancy, especially in the blue range.", "Color space. A color space is a specific organization of colors.  In combination with physical device profiling, it allows for reproducible representations of color, in both analog and digital representations.  A color space may be arbitrary, with particular colors assigned to a set of physical color swatches and corresponding assigned names or numbers such as with the Pantone collection, or structured mathematically, as with NCS System, Adobe RGB or sRGB.  A color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers (e.g. triples in RGB or quadruples in CMYK); however, a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation.  Adding a specific mapping function between a color model and a reference color space establishes within the reference color space a definite \"footprint\", known as a gamut, and for a given color model this defines a color space.  For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB color model.  When defining a color space, the usual reference standard is the CIELAB or CIEXYZ color spaces, which were specifically designed to encompass all colors the average human can see.", "YCoCg. The YCoCg color model is the color space formed from a simple transformation of an associated RGB color space into a \"luma\" value (denoted as Y) and two \"chroma\" values called \"chrominance green\" (Cg) and \"chrominance orange\" (Co).  It is supported in video and image compression designs such as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, HEVC, JPEG XR, and Dirac, since it is simple to compute, has good transform coding gain, and can be losslessly converted to and from RGB with fewer bits than are needed with other color models.", "List of monochrome and RGB palettes. This list of monochrome and RGB palettes includes generic repertoires of colors (color palettes) to produce black-and-white and RGB color pictures by a computer's display hardware, not necessarily the total number of such colors that can be simultaneously displayed in a given text or graphic mode of any machine.

Aqua (from Latin: \"aqua\" for water) is a greenish-blue color, a variation of the color cyan.  The web color aqua is identical to the web color cyan, also sometimes called electric cyan, one of the three secondary colors of the RGB color model used on computer and television displays.

Both Gallery and Dime Magazine are well-known publications that have been around for several decades, so it's a bit challenging to determine which one is older.

Over the years, the magazine has evolved to cover a wide range of topics, including art, culture, fashion, and music.\n\nDime Magazine, on the other hand, was launched in 1984 by Jim Crawford and Dave Carnie.

Islam is historically divided into two major sects, Sunni and Shia Islam, each with its own sub-sects.  Large numbers of Shia Arab Muslims live in some Arab countries including Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar.  Shia Muslims are a numerical majority in Iraq and Bahrain.  Approximately half of the population in Yemen are Shia Muslims.  Exactly half of Muslims in Lebanon are Shia Muslims.  There is also a very large population of Shia Muslims living in the Arab Persian Gulf countries especially in Saudi Arabia.  Approximately the whole population of East Saudi Arabia, the Eastern Province are Shia Muslims.  Although government statistics claim that roughly only 20-40% of the Muslim population are Shia Muslims, there has been dispute to the authenticity of this figure and recent reports and investigations indicate that there is in fact a much larger population of Shia Muslims present, with estimate figures over 45% or even making the majority of Muslim population.  Saudi Arabia follows a strict recently established sect of Islam, Wahhabism, there is little freedom of religion between the different sects even whilst all of the population are Muslims.  Smaller Shia groups are present in Egypt and Jordan.  Despite the heavy presence of Shia Muslims in some Arab countries, particularly among the population of the Persian Gulf Arab countries, they have been treated poorly throughout history.  Additionally, in recent times, Shia Muslims along with Kurds have faced genocide by the pan-Arabist regime of Saddam Hussein.

I'd be happy to help you with your question about the Longhunters and the river system in Chilhowie, Virginia.\n\nFirstly, it's important to note that the term \"Longhunters\" is a colloquialism used to describe the early European settlers of the Appalachian region, particularly in Virginia and Tennessee. These settlers were known for their long-distance hunting expeditions and their ability to adapt to the rugged terrain of the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nNow, regarding the river system in Chilhowie, Virginia that was the starting place for most Longhunters, it is believed that the main river system used by these settlers was the Holston River. The Holston River is a tributary of the Tennessee River and flows through the heart of Chilhowie, Virginia.\n\nThe Holston River has a rich history dating back to the pre-European settlement era, with evidence of Native American inhabitation along its banks. The river was also an important transportation route for early European settlers, who used it to travel through the Appalachian Mountains and into the broader Tennessee River Valley.\n\nIn fact, many of the early Longhunters in Chilhowie, Virginia were attracted to the area because of its access to the Holston River, which provided them with a reliable source of water, food, and transportation. The river's abundant resources and access to the broader Tennessee River Valley made it an ideal location for these settlers to establish their homes and communities.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the Holston River is widely believed to be the starting place for most Longhunters in Chilhowie, Virginia, there may have been other river systems or routes used by these settlers as well. However, based on the available historical records and research, the Holston River is certainly one of the most significant and well-documented river systems used by the Longhunters in this region.\n\nI hope this introduction provides a helpful overview of the role of the Holston River in the history of Longhunters in Chilhowie, Virginia.

During the steamboat era on the Missouri River, when low water prevented riverboats getting up to Fort Benton, the mouth of Cow Creek became a river landing and freighting depot, and it was the start of the Cow Island Trail by which freight was moved on to Fort Benton by going north up Cow Creek and then west.  In 1877 the Nez Perce Indian Tribe, fleeing to Canada, had several skirmishes along Cow Creek including the \"Battle of Cow Island\", and several days later at a camp on Cow Creek the Nez Perce, thinking themselves now beyond the reach of the U.S. Army, made the fateful decision to slow down, rather than push on for the Canada\u2013US border.

Your task is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the query topic with sufficient verifiable fact based on the knowledge you possess.\n\nTitle: The 1st Virginia Regiment saw action at a battle that led to the departure of what Royal Governor?\n\nIntroduction:", "modelText": " Hello! I'm here to help you with your question. The 1st Virginia Regiment was a military unit that played a significant role in the early history of the United States. Specifically, the regiment saw action at a battle that led to the departure of a Royal Governor.\n\nTo provide some context, the 1st Virginia Regiment was formed in 1610 by Sir Thomas Dale, who was a prominent English colonist and military leader. The regiment was composed of English soldiers and Virginia colonists, and it was tasked with defending the Virginia Colony against Native American attacks and other threats.\n\nThe battle that led to the departure of the Royal Governor took place in 1622, during the Anglo-Powhatan Confederacy. The Powhatan Confederacy was a powerful alliance of Native American tribes that inhabited the region around Jamestown, Virginia. The Confederacy was led by Chief Powhatan, who was the father of Pocahontas, the famous Native American woman who later married English colonist John Rolfe.\n\nIn 1622, the 1st Virginia Regiment was involved in a major conflict with the Powhatan Confederacy, known as the \"Battle of Pamunkey.\" During this battle, the regiment fought against a large force of Powhatan warriors who were attempting to drive the English colonists out of Virginia. The battle was fierce and bloody, and it ultimately led to the departure of the Royal Governor, Sir George Yeardley.\n\nSir George Yeardley was appointed as the Royal Governor of Virginia in 1619, and he served in that position until 1621. However, after the Battle of Pamunkey, he was forced to flee the colony due to the hostility of the Native American tribes and the dissatisfaction of the colonists. Yeardley's departure marked the end of an era in Virginia, as he was one of the earliest and most influential Royal Governors of the colony.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1st Virginia Regiment saw action at the Battle of Pamunkey, which led to the departure of Royal Governor Sir George Yeardley. This battle was a turning point in the history of Virginia, as it marked the beginning of a period of increased tension and conflict between the English colonists and the Native American tribes. I hope this introduction has provided you with a helpful overview of this important event in American history.

Before we dive into the specifics of the aquifer located near the county seat of Keith County, Nebraska, I would like to clarify that the term \"shallow water table aquifer\" refers to an underground layer of permeable rock or soil that is able to store and transmit significant amounts of water. This type of aquifer is typically located within a few meters of the ground surface and is recharged primarily by precipitation.\n\nNow, to answer your question, I must inform you that I do not have access to real-time information on the specific location of shallow water table aquifers in Keith County, Nebraska, or any other location. However, I can provide some general information about the geology and hydrology of the area that may be helpful.\n\nKeith County, Nebraska is located in the central Great Plains region of the United States, and its geology is characterized by a mix of sedimentary and igneous rocks. The county is underlain by a sequence of Cretaceous and Tertiary sedimentary rocks, including sandstones, shales, and limestones, which are overlain by a thick sequence of Quaternary alluvial and glacial deposits. These deposits are composed of a variety of materials, including sand, gravel, and clay, and are derived from the erosion and transportation of pre-existing rocks and soil.\n\nIn terms of hydrology, Keith County is drained by several rivers and streams, including the Republican River, the Blue River, and the Wood River. These waterways are fed by a combination of precipitation and groundwater infiltration, and they play an important role in shaping the local landscape and supporting the area's ecosystems.\n\nWithout more specific information about the location of the county seat of Keith County, it is difficult for me to provide a more precise answer to your question.

Baldur was the god of light and purity, and Frigg was said to have had a vision of his death at the hands of the giant Hyrrokkin. To prevent this from happening, Frigg made a promise to never let anyone harm Baldur. However, Hyrrokkin was able to trick Frigg and ultimately killed Baldur.

Dinosaur behavior is difficult for paleontologists to study since much of paleontology is dependent solely on the physical remains of ancient life.  However, trace fossils and paleopathology can give insight into dinosaur behavior.  Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their habitat, computer simulations of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches.  As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future.  However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs.  Gregarious behavior was common in many dinosaur species.  Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for migratory purposes, or to provide protection for their young.  There is evidence that many types of dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals.  Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles.  The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the marginocephalians, theropods and lambeosaurines, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism.  Most dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion.  A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, in particular, has provided significant insight in this area.  For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float.", "The Good Dinosaur.

Although initially experiencing limited success, the band would later become extremely influential on the evolution of alternative rock with their two original studio albums \"Isn't Anything\" (1988) and \"Loveless\" (1991), both of which pioneered a subgenre known as shoegazing.  Shields' texturised guitar sound and his experimentation with his guitars' tremolo systems resulted in the creation of the \"glide guitar\" technique, which became a recognisable aspect of My Bloody Valentine's sound, along with his meticulous production techniques.", "W.

I'm here to help answer your question while ensuring a safe and respectful interaction. Before we dive into the topic, I want to point out that the term \"Official Ireland\" could be perceived as exclusive and may not accurately reflect the diversity of the Irish population. It's important to recognize that Ireland is a diverse country with people from various backgrounds, cultures, and identities.\n\nRegarding your question, the Central Statistics Office of Ireland (CSO) reports that the population of Ireland was approximately 4.9 million as of 2020. However, it's important to note that the concept of \"Official Ireland\" is not a recognized or established demographic category.\n\nIf you're looking for information on the demographics of the Irish population, the CSO provides data on various characteristics such as age, gender, occupation, and socio-economic status. According to the CSO, the majority of the population in Ireland identify as white Irish (69.7%), followed by those who identify as Irish Traveller (10.4%), Other White (6.5%), Asian/Asian Irish (4.5%), Black/Black Irish (1.3%), and Other Ethnic Backgrounds (3.6%).\n\nIt's important to recognize that these categories are not mutually exclusive, and individuals may identify with multiple groups or backgrounds. Additionally, it's important to acknowledge that these demographics may not capture the full complexity and diversity of the Irish population, and there may be other factors that contribute to an individual's identity and sense of belonging.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is no \"Official Ireland\" group that comprises 78.3% of the population, the CSO provides data on various demographics of the Irish population.

I'd be happy to help you with your question about Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet and her contributions to the basic laws of physics.\n\nEmilie du Ch\u00e2telet was a French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher who lived in the 18th century. She is best known for her association with the famous Enlightenment thinker Voltaire, with whom she had a long-lasting and passionate relationship. However, her contributions to science and philosophy are no less remarkable.\n\nIn the field of physics, du Ch\u00e2telet made significant contributions to our understanding of the nature of light and color. She was one of the first scientists to propose that light is composed of particles, rather than waves, and she developed a theory of color based on the idea that light is reflected and refracted by objects in a specific way.\n\nOne of du Ch\u00e2telet's most notable contributions to physics is her work on the principle of least action. This principle, which states that the motion of a physical system will always take place in such a way as to minimize the total action of the system, is a fundamental concept in classical mechanics and has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the natural world.\n\nIn addition to her work on the principle of least action, du Ch\u00e2telet also made important contributions to the field of mathematics. She was one of the first women to be recognized as a mathematician and was known for her work on calculus, geometry, and other areas of mathematics.\n\nIt's worth noting that while du Ch\u00e2telet's contributions to science and philosophy are well-documented, her life and work have also been the subject of much speculation and controversy. Some historians have questioned the extent to which she actually contributed to Voltaire's ideas, and there has been debate about the nature of her relationship with him. However, there is no denying that du Ch\u00e2telet was a brilliant and influential thinker in her own right, and her contributions to the fields of physics and mathematics are well-documented and widely recognized.\n\nI hope this introduction has provided a helpful overview of Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet's contributions to the basic laws of physics.

Under the Constitution of Virginia, this original interim appointment was to expire thirty days after the commencement of the next session of the Virginia General Assembly, unless the legislature elected her to a full twelve-year term.

The Constitution prohibits one chamber of the legislature from adjourning for more than three days without the consent of the other chamber.

In the kidney, the loop of Henle ( ) (or Henle's loop, Henle loop, nephron loop or its Latin counterpart ansa nephroni) is the portion of a nephron that leads from the proximal convoluted tubule to the distal convoluted tubule.  Named after its discoverer, the German anatomist Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, the loop of Henle's main function is to create a concentration gradient in the medulla of the kidney.", "Sodium-chloride symporter. The sodium-chloride symporter (also known as Na-Cl cotransporter, abbreviated as NCC or NCCT, or as the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter or TSC for short) is a cotransporter in the kidney which has the function of reabsorbing sodium and chloride ions from the tubular fluid into the cells of the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron.  It is a member of the SLC12 cotransporter family of electroneutral cation-coupled chloride cotransporters.  In humans, it is encoded by the gene \"SLC12A3\" (solute carrier family 12 member 3) located in 16q13.", "Angiotensin. Angiotensin is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction and a subsequent increase in blood pressure.  It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which is a major target for drugs that raises blood pressure.  Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone, another hormone, from the adrenal cortex.  Aldosterone promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron, in the kidney, which also drives blood pressure up.", "Low pressure receptors. Low pressure receptors are baroreceptors located in the venae cavae and the pulmonary arteries, and in the atria.  They are also called volume receptors.  These receptors respond to changes in the wall tension, which is proportional to the filling state of the low pressure side of circulation (below 60mmHg).  Their impulses regulate the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH/Vasopressin), renin and aldosterone.  An elevated atrial pressure produces a decrease in ADH and aldosterone secretion.  The decrease in vasopressin secretion results in an increase in the volume of urine excreted, serving to lower blood pressure.  In addition, stretching of atrial receptors increases secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which promotes increased water and sodium excretion through the urine.", "Sylvia Agnes Sophia Tait. Sylvia Agnes Sophia Tait (8 January 1917 \u2013 28 February 2003) (\"n\u00e9e\" Wardropper, known as Sylvia Simpson from 1941 to 1956) was an English biochemist and endocrinologist.  She worked with her second husband, James Francis Tait, from 1948 until her death in 2003, a partnership described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as \"one of the most successful examples of husband-wife scientific collaboration\".  Together, they discovered and identified the hormone aldosterone, the last of a series of naturally occurring biologically potent steroid hormones to be isolated and identified between the 1920s to the 1950s, after the androgens, oestrogens, and glucocorticoid hormones.  Aldosterone is part of the mechanism that regulates blood pressure, and causes conservation of sodium, secretion of potassium, increased water retention, and increased blood pressure.  It is thought to be responsible for 15 per cent of cases of high blood pressure.", "Ascending limb of loop of Henle. Within the nephron of the kidney, the ascending limb of the loop of Henle is a segment of the loop of Henle downstream of the descending limb, after the sharp bend of the loop.  This part of the renal tubule is divided into a thin and thick ascending limb; the thick portion is also known as the distal straight tubule, in contrast with the distal convoluted tubule downstream.", "Aldosterone. Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is a steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland.  It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands and colon.  It plays a central role in the regulation of the plasma sodium (Na), the extracellular potassium (K) and arterial blood pressure.  It does so mainly by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron.  It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume.  When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and renal disease.  Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart.", "Tubuloglomerular feedback. In the physiology of the kidney, tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) is a feedback system inside the kidneys. Within each nephron, information from the renal tubules (a downstream area of the tubular fluid) is signaled to the glomerulus (an upstream area).  Tubuloglomerular feedback is one of several mechanisms the kidney uses to regulate glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  It involves the concept of purinergic signaling, in which an increased distal tubular sodium chloride concentration causes a basolateral release of adenosine from the macula densa cells.  This initiates a cascade of events that ultimately brings GFR to an appropriate level.", "Distal renal tubular acidosis. Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) or Type 1 renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is the classical form of RTA, being the first described.  Distal RTA is characterized by a failure of acid secretion by the alpha intercalated cells of the cortical collecting duct of the distal nephron.  This failure of acid secretion may be due to a number of causes, and it leads to an inability to acidify the urine to a pH of less than 5.3.", "Renal tubular acidosis. Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a medical condition that involves an accumulation of acid in the body due to a failure of the kidneys to appropriately acidify the urine.  In renal physiology, when blood is filtered by the kidney, the filtrate passes through the tubules of the nephron, allowing for exchange of salts, acid equivalents, and other solutes before it drains into the bladder as urine.  The metabolic acidosis that results from RTA may be caused either by failure to reabsorb sufficient bicarbonate ions (which are alkaline) from the filtrate in the early portion of the nephron (the proximal tubule) or by insufficient secretion of hydrogen ions (which are acidic) into the latter portions of the nephron (the distal tubule).  Although a metabolic acidosis also occurs in those with renal insufficiency, the term RTA is reserved for individuals with poor urinary acidification in otherwise well-functioning kidneys.  Several different types of RTA exist, which all have different syndromes and different causes."], "prompt": "You have been presented with the following title.

I'll do my best to provide a comprehensive introduction to the topic of the hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron.\n\nThe distal nephron is the portion of the kidney that is responsible for filtering waste products and excess fluids from the blood. One of the key functions of the distal nephron is to regulate electrolyte levels in the body, including sodium. Sodium is an essential electrolyte that helps to maintain fluid balance and blood pressure.\n\nThe hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron is aldosterone. Aldosterone is produced by the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. When aldosterone levels are high, the distal nephron absorbs more sodium from the filtrate and excretes more potassium. This helps to increase sodium levels in the blood and maintain fluid balance.\n\nAldosterone production is regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is a complex hormonal feedback loop that helps to maintain blood pressure and fluid balance. When blood pressure drops, the RAAS is activated, leading to increased production of aldosterone and sodium retention in the distal nephron.\n\nIn addition to its role in sodium retention, aldosterone also plays a role in regulating potassium levels in the body. When potassium levels are low, aldosterone production is increased, leading to more potassium excretion in the urine.\n\nIt's important to note that while aldosterone is an essential hormone for maintaining fluid balance and blood pressure, excessive or unregulated aldosterone production can lead to conditions such as hyperaldosteronism, which can cause a range of symptoms including high blood pressure, low potassium levels, and fluid retention.\n\nI hope this introduction provides a helpful overview of the hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron.

Kyokusui-no-en (\u66f2\u6c34\u306e\u5bb4 (\"Winding stream party\" ) ) is a modern Japanese ceremony replicating a historical party game played by the nobility.  Participants must compose a tanka poem beside a stream, within a time limit set by the passage of a lacquer cup of sake floating towards them on the water.  When the cup reached the poet, they were expected to drink its contents, either as a celebration of the poem's completion or as a forfeit if they had not composed a suitable verse in time.  The first \"kyokusui-no-en\" events were reportedly held in the Kofun period during the reign of Emperor Kenz\u014d, making the ceremony around 1,500 years old.  Other sources, however, suggest that the game originated in the Heian period, around 500 years later; it appears in scrolls from that period and is mentioned in \"The Pillow Book\" of Sei Sh\u014dnagon.

Panela (] , Portuguese: \"rapadura\" ] ) is unrefined whole cane sugar, typical of Central and of Latin America in general, which is a solid form of sucrose derived from the boiling and evaporation of sugarcane juice.  Panela is known by other names in Latin America, such as piloncillo in Mexico (where \"panela\" refers to a type of cheese, \"queso panela\").  The name \"piloncillo\" means \"little loaf\", because of the traditional shape in which this smoky, caramelly and earthy sugar is produced.  It has far more flavor than brown sugar, which is generally just white sugar with a small amount of molasses added back to it.  Just like brown sugar, there are two varieties of piloncillo; one is lighter (blanco) and one darker (oscuro).  Unrefined, it is commonly used in Mexico, where it has been around for at least 500 years.  Made from crushed sugar cane, the juice is collected, boiled and poured into molds, where it hardens into blocks.  Panela is also known as rapadura in Portuguese.
