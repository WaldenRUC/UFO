      "New York Society of Model Engineers. The New York Society of Model Engineers (NYSME) was originally incorporated in 1926 in New York City.  There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905.  In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan.  AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout.  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces.  Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.  This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.  They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time.  The space?  Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City.  Here the layout was built.  It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa.  It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.  During the early-1950s the organization moved to its current location in Carlstadt, New Jersey."

      "Loan modification in the United States. Loan modification is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates, monthly payments or principal balances.  Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.",

The project's cost was $43 million.  Of that amount, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contributed 80-90 percent of the project cost.  KDOT and MoDOT shared the remaining cost.  The system employs a system of electronic boards placed on major highways throughout the metropolitan area that display traffic information whenever information needs to be displayed (due to an accident, lane closure, highway closure etc.), and the system also has cameras on those billboards to automatically detect traffic problems.  While the system has extensive coverage of highways in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area it still has much more to cover.  Since it would be too expensive to cover all the major highways in the Kansas City metro (which has more miles of highway per person than any other metropolitan area in the United States), studies were conducted to determine which highways or segments of highways have priority due to higher accident rates.  Since the project's beginning, it has expanded greatly, and will continue to expand.  Future plans are to extend coverage to I-635 and cover I-435 even more (especially in the northern areas of the metro) as well as other major city highways.

      "Loan modification in the United States. Loan modification is the systematic alteration of mortgage loan agreements that help those having problems making the payments by reducing interest rates, monthly payments or principal balances.  Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.",

It incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities with integration with iOS and other Apple products and services.  The original generation of the device was available in four variants: Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, Apple Watch Hermès, and Apple Watch Edition; each distinguished by different combinations of cases and first- or third-party interchangeable bands.  Apple Watch relies on a wirelessly connected iPhone to perform many of its default functions such as calling and texting.  It is compatible with the iPhone 5 or later models running iOS 8.2 or later, through the use of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  Announced by Apple CEO Tim Cook in September 2014, the device was released in April 24, 2015.  The Apple Watch quickly became the best-selling wearable device with the supply of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of the 2015 fiscal year.  The second generation of Apple Watch, released in September 2016, includes two tiers: Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Series 1, which includes the S1P chip, but is otherwise identical to the original.

      "Trainmaster Command Control. Trainmaster Command (TMCC) is Lionel's electronic control system for O scale 3-rail model trains and toy trains that mainly ran from 1994 to 2006.  Conceptually it is similar to Digital Command Control (DCC), the industry's open standard used by HO scale and other 2-rail DC trains.  It has one advantage over DCC, in that TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives and Lionel Legacy engines as well as LionChief and LionChief Plus equipped locomotives.  The latter require a dedicated remote controller.  MTH Corporation's DCS controller can be configured to control TMCC locomotives, and all four systems (TMCC, Legacy, LionChief/LionChief+ and DCS) can be operated on the same track simultaneously.  Each simply requires a constant track voltage (18 volts).  TMCC/Legacy \"broadcasts\" it's signal to the antenna on the locomotives which listen for signals that first identify the particular locomotive by number and then it issues given commands as to speed, direction, sounds, lighting and other features.  DCS performs similar functions but transmits a carrier over the rails which are picked up through the locomotive's electrical pickup contacts.  While TMCC/Legacy and DCS remote controls relay operator commands to a device that transmits them to the train (Command Base or Track Interface Unit), LionChief/LionChief+ also issue remote control commands but the remote and locomotive are married and each locomotive requires a separate remote control.  This system requires no additional wiring as the control is directly \"narrowcast\" to the locomotive in the same way as a television remote control or garage door opener functions.  In 2017, Lionel released a universal remote for LionChief+ that will learn addresses for up to three locos at a time, simplifying the operation of multiple trains."

      "Huernia. The genus Huernia (family Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae) consists of stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa, first described as a genus in 1810.  The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus \"Stapelia\", and often striped vividly in contrasting colours or tones, some glossy, others matt and wrinkled depending on the species concerned.  To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion.  The genus is considered close to the genera \"Stapelia\" and \"Hoodia\".  The name is in honour of Justin Heurnius (1587–1652) a Dutch missionary who is reputed to have been the first collector of South African Cape plants.

      "Crank Caverns. Crank Caverns is the common name of the remains of the Rainford Delph Quarry near Crank in St. Helens, Merseyside.  It is a network of underground tunnels and caverns, as well as an extensive woodland.  Information in the St. Helens local history archives states that sandstone quarrying began here as early as 1730.  As the quarry expanded, the cost of purchasing land to open cast mine it increased, so it was decided to opt for a different method.  Instead of quarrying out the stone, they would mine it out, following a seam of stone until it ran out.  This resulted in the network of caves, tunnels and shafts we see today.  Rainford Delph is listed as a Colliery by 1854, under the ownership of Charles Howarth or Yorkshire Charlie as he was known locally by 1880.  Mining finally ceased and the woods and caverns were used as a game reserve by the Earl of Derby until 1939, when they became a storage facility for ammunition for the anti-aircraft position at Crank.  After the war, the caverns ceased use as a game reserve.  Today, Crank Caverns are not officially open to the public and due to their increasing instability, attempts have been made to close access to the caverns and tunnels themselves.

The SRs soon split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions.  The anti-Bolshevik faction of this party, known as the Right SRs, which remained loyal to the Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution.",

Louise Bryant (December 5, 1885 – January 6, 1936) was an American feminist, political activist, and journalist best known for her sympathetic coverage of Russia and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution.  Bryant, who married writer John Reed, her second husband, in 1916, wrote about Russian leaders such as Katherine Breshkovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Alexander Kerensky, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky.  Her news stories, distributed by Hearst during and after her trips to Petrograd and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the United States and Canada in the years immediately following World War I.  A collection of articles from her first trip was published in book form as \"Six Red Months in Russia\" in 1918.  During the next year, she defended the revolution in testimony before the Overman Committee, a Senate subcommittee established to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States.  Later in 1919, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks and to denounce armed U.S. intervention in Russia.",
      "Communism in Russia. Communism in Russia began after Tsar Nicholas II lost his power during the February Revolution.  The Provisional Government was established under Prince Lvov, however, the Bolsheviks refused to accept the government and revolted in October 1917, taking control of Russia.  Vladmir Lenin, their leader, rose to power and governed between 1917 and 1924.  The Bolsheviks formed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, marking the beginning of the Russian Civil War between the revolutionary Reds and the counter-revolutionary Whites.  In 1922 the Communist Reds were victorious, and formed the Soviet Union.  Lenin died in 1924, starting a power struggle which ended with Joseph Stalin seizing power.  He was the leader of the Communist Party until 1953.  He encouraged political paranoia and conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents of his dominance.",
      "Russian Civil War. The Russian Civil War (Russian: Гражда́нская война́ в Росси́и , \"Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi\" ; November 1917 – October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.  The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.  Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.  The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.  The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920.  Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.  The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.  There were an estimated 7,000,000–12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.  The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.",

Russian Bolsheviks of Yakov Triapitsyn launched a surprise attack on an American army camp at Romanovka, Siberia near Vladivostok.  As a result of the engagement, the attacks were repelled.  Romanovka and the Suchan Valley Campaign that followed were the final major engagements of the Russian Civil War involving the United States.  Battles would later break out again between the Americans and Bolsheviks, as well as the Cossacks, on much smaller scales.  Likewise, the Americans were invariably victorious."

    "modelText": "\nAlexander Kerensky was a Russian politician and lawyer who served as the first prime minister of the Russian Provisional Government during the First World War. He was a key figure in the Russian Revolution of 1917, which overthrew the Romanov dynasty and ended the Russian Empire. However, Kerensky's tenure as prime minister was short-lived, as he was eventually defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of a civil war that ended in 1922.\n\nThe Russian Civil War was a multi-sided conflict that lasted from 1918 to 1922 and involved various factions, including the Bolsheviks, the White Army, and the Red Army. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, were the eventual victors of the conflict, and their victory marked the end of the Russian Provisional Government and the beginning of the Soviet Union.\n\nKerensky's defeat and destruction at the hands of the Bolsheviks was a significant event in Russian history, as it marked the end of the Provisional Government and the beginning of Soviet rule. In this essay, we will explore the events leading up to Kerensky's defeat and the aftermath of his defeat, including the impact it had on the Russian people and the wider world."

    "prompt": "You have been presented with the following title. Your task is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the query topic with sufficient verifiable fact based on the knowledge you possess.\n\nTitle: Ralph Hefferline was a psychology professor at a university that is located in what city?\n\nIntroduction:",
    "modelText": "\n\nRalph Hefferline was a prominent psychology professor who made significant contributions to the field of psychology. He was a professor at a university located in a city that is well-known for its academic institutions and cultural landmarks. Unfortunately, there is limited information available about Ralph Hefferline's life and career, and it is unclear which university he was affiliated with. However, based on available records, it is possible to speculate on the location of the university where he taught.\n\nOne possible clue to the location of the university where Ralph Hefferline taught is the fact that he was a student of G. Stanley Hall, who was a prominent psychologist and educator in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Hall was the first president of John Hopkins University, which is located in Baltimore, Maryland. It is possible that Hefferline was also affiliated with this university, as it was a major center for psychological research and education at the time.\n\nAnother possible clue to the location of the university where Ralph Hefferline taught is the fact that he was a member of the American Psychological Association (APA), which was founded in 1892. The APA was headquartered in Washington, D.C. during the early years of its existence, and it is possible that Hefferline was affiliated with a university in the Washington, D.C. area.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is limited information available about Ralph Hefferline's life and career, it is possible to speculate on the location of the university where he taught based on available records. It is possible that he was affiliated with John Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, or with a university in the Washington, D.C. area. Further research is needed to confirm these possibilities and to identify the specific university where Ralph Hefferline taught."

    "question": "Which dog's ancestors include Gordon and Irish Setters: the Manchester Terrier or the Scotch Collie?",
    "answer": "Scotch Collie",
    "document": [
      "Scotch Collie. The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland.  The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie.  It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes.  Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters.",
      "Collie. The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds.  The type originated in Scotland and Northern England.  The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout.  Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders.  Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct.  Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types.  Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability.  While the AKC has a breed they call \"Collie\", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds.  There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports.  They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity.",
      "Viol. The viol , viola da gamba ] , or (informally) gamba, is any one of a family of bowed, fretted and stringed instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes where the tension on the strings can be increased or decreased to adjust the pitch of each of the strings.  Frets on the viol are usually made of gut, tied on the fingerboard around the instrument's neck, to enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly.  Frets improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone which better matches the open strings.  Viols first appeared in Spain in the mid to late 15th century and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque (1600-1750) periods.  Early ancestors include the Arabic \"rebab\" and the medieval European vielle, but later, more direct possible ancestors include the Venetian \"viole\" and the 15th- and 16th-century Spanish \"vihuela\", a 6-course plucked instrument tuned like a lute (and also like a present-day viol) that looked like but was quite distinct from (at that time) the 4-course guitar (an earlier chordophone).",
      "Toy Manchester Terrier. The Toy Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog, categorized as a terrier.  The breed was bred down in size in North America from the Manchester Terrier, and is placed in the Toy Group by the American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club (the Manchester Terrier is placed in the Terrier Group.)  Neither the Fédération Cynologique Internationale nor The Kennel Club recognize a Toy variety of the Manchester Terrier.",
      "Irish Red and White Setter. The Irish Red and White Setter () is a breed of dog, more specifically a setter.  As with all the setters and the Pointer, it is classified as a gundog in the UK and is included in the sporting group in America and Canada.  It is virtually identical in use and temperament to the related Irish Setter and its other setter cousins, the Gordon and English setters, but is more often found as a working gun dog.",
      "English Setter. The English Setter is a medium size breed of dog.  It is part of the Setter family, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters.  The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail.  The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton.",
      "Russkiy Toy. The Russian Toy (also known as the Russian Toy Terrier, and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy, Toychik,Russian: Русский той, Тойчик ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier which is known today as the Manchester Terrier.  There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat.  The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier.  Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the \"Terrier\" was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010.  The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia.",
      "Teddy Roosevelt Terrier. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier.  Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.",
      "Feist (dog). A Feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants.  These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct English White Terrier.  These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners.  Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier.",
      "Florence Nagle. Florence Nagle (26 October 1894 – 30 October 1988) was a trainer and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of pedigree dogs, and an active feminist.  Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, and went on to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions.  Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle.  She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions.  The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters."

      "Outline of Ethiopia. Ethiopia is a landlocked sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa.  Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east.  Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa's second-most populous nation.  Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity's oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution.  Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world.  Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC.  The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name \"Ethiopia\" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots).  After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint (\"Era of the Judges/Princes\"), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history.  Ethiopia's borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization.  It was brutally occupied by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, ending with its liberation by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces.",

P'ent'ay (from Amharic: , also transliterated as Pentay or Pente) is an Amharic and Tigrinya language term for a Christian of a Protestant denomination, widely used in Ethiopia and among Ethiopians and Eritreans living abroad.  The term was coined in the late 1960s and was used as a pejorative for churches that believed in the Pentecostal experience.  Today, it is used to describe local Protestant Christians who are not members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo churches.  The term \"P'ent'ay\" is a shortening of the word \"Pentecostal\"; however, it is widely used when referring to all Protestant Christians whether they are actual Pentecostals or not.  Some Orthodox will also apply the term to the small Catholic population of Ethiopia.  The equivalent rendition in many other languages is Evangelicals.  The four major Evangelical denominations in Ethiopia are: the Kale Heywet (Word of Life); Mekane Yesus (Place of Jesus), Lutheran; Mulu Wongel (Full Gospel) and Meserete Kristos (meaning \"Christ foundation\") or Mennonite.  Some P'ent'ay communities - especially Mekane Yesus - have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which represents mainstream, traditional Ethiopian Christianity.  But for the most part they are very Pentecostal in their worship and theology.",

      "First Italo-Ethiopian War. The First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896.  It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate.  Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria.  Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected.  In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war.  Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the United Kingdom and France in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.  Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.  Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea.",

(Some of this material was also reissued as two 2-LP sets in 1980 by MCA under the titles \"Coltrane In Tokyo Vol.  1\" and \"Coltrane In Tokyo Vol.  2\") The first CD issues were by Impulse!  Japan as two 2-CD sets: \"Live In Japan Vol.  1\" (same as \"Coltrane In Japan\") and \"Live In Japan Vol.  2\" (same as \"Second Night In Tokyo\").  The US 4-CD edition includes both of these volumes, with identical mastering from the original mono tapes.  The side six interview from \"Second Night In Tokyo\" has never been reissued on any CD edition.",
      "Chrome, Smoke &amp; BBQ. Chrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003.  At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format.  This box set, and the companion release \"Rancho Texicano\", were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from \"ZZ Top's First Album\", \"Rio Grande Mud\", and \"Tejas\", aside from 1977's \"The Best of ZZ Top\" which features two tracks from \"Rio Grande Mud\" and one track from \"First Album\". \" Tres Hombres\" and \"Fandango! \" were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes.",

The first track, \"To Know Him Is to Love Him,\" released in 1958, features Spector performing as part of the group the Teddy Bears.

      "Trash Box. Trash Box is a 5-CD box set of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings, primarily by American bands.  This box set is similar to the earlier \"Pebbles Box\" (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc.  Supposedly, \"the Trash Box\" collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records).  However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on \"Pebbles, Volume 4\" have been eschewed entirely.  Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the \"Pebbles Box\".  Although most of the recordings on \"the Trash Box\" were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series.  Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit \"I Fought the Law (but the Law Won)\" by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) – which is also included in the \"Pebbles Box\" – in place of the much rarer \"Wine Wine Wine\" by Bobby Fuller that appears on \"Pebbles, Volume 2\".",
      "Mono Masters. Mono Masters is a compilation album by the Beatles, and is an alternate, all-mono version of the album \"Past Masters\".  \"Mono Masters\" was originally a two-CD set included as part of \"The Beatles in Mono\" box set.  The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix (the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo, and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version).  As a result, the track listing for \"Mono Masters\" differs from \"Past Masters\" on the second half of disc two, omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix (\"Old Brown Shoe\", \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" and \"Let It Be\"), and adding several songs released on stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes.  Tracks 9–12 and 15 were prepared in March 1969 for release as a 7\" mono \"Yellow Submarine\" EP, two months after the release of the similarly titled soundtrack album, but the project was scrapped, although the EP was mastered.  Subsequently, the tracks were only released in stereo (and in an electronically produced mono mixdown, or \"fold-down\", of the stereo mix), while the true mono mixes remained unreleased.  \"Get Back\" (with B-side \"Don't Let Me Down\") was the final Beatles single mixed for mono format.  It was released in the UK in mono, though the US release was in stereo.  Thus, the songs that were originally released on stereo singles in the UK are omitted on this release."

    "modelText": "\n\nDuring World War II, the British Royal Air Force (RAF) developed several first-generation jet-powered aircraft, including the Gloster Meteor, which was the first British jet-powered aircraft to enter service. However, the Meteor was primarily used for defense purposes and did not see significant action in the South West Pacific theatre of the war.\n\nOne British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber that was used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II was the de Havilland Vampire. The Vampire was a twin-engined jet-powered fighter that was developed by the British aircraft manufacturer de Havilland. It was the second jet-powered aircraft to enter service with the RAF, and it saw extensive action in the South West Pacific theatre of the war.\n\nThe Vampire was primarily used as a fighter aircraft, but it was also used in the ground-attack role. It was armed with four 20mm cannons and could carry a variety of bombs and rockets. The Vampire was a highly maneuverable aircraft and was able to outturn most of the piston-engined fighters it encountered.\n\nThe Vampire was first used in combat in 1943, and it played a significant role in the Battle of the Philippines in 1944. It was also used in the Battle of Okinawa in 1945, where it was used to attack Japanese ground targets.\n\nIn conclusion, the de Havilland Vampire was a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber that was used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. It was a highly effective aircraft that played a significant role in the war, and it remains an important part of aviation history."

The Auger effect was discovered independently by both Lise Meitner and Pierre Auger in the 1920s.  Though the discovery was made by Meitner and initially reported in the journal \"Zeitschrift für Physik\" in 1922, Auger is credited with the discovery in most of the scientific community.  Until the early 1950s Auger transitions were considered nuisance effects by spectroscopists, not containing much relevant material information, but studied so as to explain anomalies in X-ray spectroscopy data.

He was born on August 22, 1962, in St. Louis, Missouri, and began his boxing career in 1980. Phillips had a successful career, winning several titles and fighting against notable opponents such as Donald Curry and Milton McCrory.\n\nHowever, the question at hand is not about Vince Phillips' career or accomplishments, but rather about the organization that recognized him as a junior welterweight champion. The answer to this question is likely to be relevant to boxing enthusiasts and historians, as well as those interested in the broader topic of sports and athletic achievement.\n\nTo provide a comprehensive introduction to this query topic, it is important to understand the context of boxing titles and the role of boxing organizations in recognizing and sanctioning these titles. In the sport of boxing, titles are awarded to fighters who are recognized as the best in their weight class by a particular organization. There are several major boxing organizations, each with its own set of rules and criteria for awarding titles.\n\nThe most well-known and prestigious of these organizations is the International Boxing Hall of Fame (IBHOF), which is located in Canastota, New York. The IBHOF was founded in 1989 and is dedicated to preserving the history of boxing and honoring its greatest fighters, trainers, and other contributors. The IBHOF inducts new members annually and holds an induction ceremony each June.\n\nGiven this context, the question at hand can be rephrased as follows: Which organization recognized Vince Phillips as a junior welterweight champion, and how does this recognition relate to his overall career and achievements in the sport of boxing? To answer this question, it will be necessary to research the various boxing organizations that recognized junior welterweight titles during Vince Phillips' career and determine which one he held a title"

It is possible that the query is referring to former Governor Mike Huckabee, who served as the Governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007. Huckabee was a prominent figure in Republican politics during Suettinger's tenure as National Intelligence Officer for East Asia, and he may have had some involvement in intelligence matters related to East Asia during his time as Governor.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Suettinger's role as National Intelligence Officer for East Asia was a federal position, and he would have reported to the President of the United States and the Director of National Intelligence, rather than to the Governor of Arkansas. Therefore, it is unclear what specific connection Suettinger may have had with former Governor Huckabee or any other former Governor of Arkansas."

    "modelText": "\n\nAlvaro Mexia was a Spanish conquistador who played a significant role in the conquest of the Aztec Empire. He was a close ally of Hernan Cortes and participated in the fall of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire, in 1521. However, after the conquest, Mexia was given a diplomatic mission to establish peaceful relations with one of the indigenous tribes in the region.\n\nThe tribe with which Mexia had a diplomatic mission is not explicitly mentioned in historical records, but it is believed to be the Tlaxcalans. The Tlaxcalans were a Nahua-speaking indigenous tribe that lived in the region of Tlaxcala, which was located between the Aztec Empire and the Spanish conquistadors. They were known for their skill in warfare and had a complex relationship with the Aztecs, often fighting against them but also trading with them.\n\nMexia's diplomatic mission to the Tlaxcalans was likely an attempt by the Spanish to establish alliances with indigenous tribes in the region and gain support for their conquest of the Aztec Empire. The Tlaxcalans were initially hesitant to ally with the Spanish, but they eventually agreed to an alliance after Mexia promised to help them gain independence from the Aztecs.\n\nOverall, Alvaro Mexia's diplomatic mission to the Tlaxcalans was an important event in the history of the Spanish conquest of Mexico, as it helped to establish alliances with indigenous tribes in the region and paved the way for further conquests."

However, this translation process may result in loss and distortion of information as the people from subordinate groups cannot articulate their ideas clearly.  The dominant may also ignore the voice of the lower-power.  All these may eventually lead to the mutedness of the subordinate group.

    "modelText": "\n\nSocial anthropology is a field of study that focuses on the social and cultural aspects of human societies. It is a discipline that has been shaped by many scholars over the years, and two of the most prominent figures in the field are Alfred Gell and Edmund Leach. However, there is a question that has been asked by many people in the field, and that is what nationality were these two scholars? In this introduction, we will explore the background of these two scholars and their contributions to the field of social anthropology.\n\nAlfred Gell was born in 1945 in England. He was a British social anthropologist who made significant contributions to the field of social anthropology. Gell's work focused on the relationship between art, culture, and social organization. He was particularly interested in the ways in which art and culture are used to create social bonds and to express social identity. Gell's most famous work is probably \"Art and Agency: An Anthropological Theory,\" which was published in 1998. In this book, he argued that art is not just a reflection of social reality but is also an active agent in shaping social reality.\n\nEdmund Leach was born in 1910 in England. He was also a British social anthropologist who made significant contributions to the field of social anthropology. Leach's work focused on the relationship between culture and social structure. He was particularly interested in the ways in which cultural norms and values are used to maintain social order. Leach's most famous work is probably \"Political Systems of Highland Burma,\" which was published in 1954. In this book, he argued that the political systems of highland Burma were based on a complex network of social relationships rather than on a centralized authority.\n\nIn conclusion, Alfred Gell and Edmund Leach were both British social anthropologists who made significant contributions to the field of social anthropology.

      "Franklin D. Roosevelt's record on civil rights. In June 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which created the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC).  It was the most important federal move in support of the rights of African-Americans between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The President's order stated that the federal government would not hire any person based on their race, color, creed, or national origin.  The FEPC enforced the order to ban discriminatory hiring within the federal government and in corporations that received federal contracts.  Millions of blacks and women achieved better jobs and better pay as a result.  The war brought the race issue to the forefront.  The Army and Navy had been segregated since the Civil War.  But by 1940, the African-American vote had largely shifted from Republican to Democrat, and African-American leaders like Walter Francis White of the NAACP and T. Arnold Hill of the Urban League had become recognized as part of the Roosevelt coalition.  In June 1941, at the urging of A. Philip Randolph, the leading African-American trade unionist, Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the Fair Employment Practice Committee and prohibiting discrimination by any government agency, including the armed forces.  In practice the services, particularly the Navy and the Marines, found ways to evade this order — the Marine Corps remained all-white until 1942.  In September 1942, at Eleanor's instigation, Roosevelt met with a delegation of African-American leaders, who demanded full integration into the forces, including the right to serve in combat roles and in the Navy, the Marine Corps and the United States Army Air Forces.  Roosevelt agreed, but then did nothing to implement his promise.  It was left to his successor, Harry S. Truman, to fully desegregate the armed forces.",

Your task is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the query topic with sufficient verifiable fact based on the knowledge you possess.\n\nTitle: Rostker v. Goldberg held that the practice of what way of filling armed forces vacancies was consitutional?\n\nIntroduction:",
    "modelText": "\n\nRostker v. Goldberg was a landmark case decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1981. The case dealt with the constitutionality of a law that required all males between the ages of 18 and 25 to register with the Selective Service System. The plaintiffs in the case argued that the law violated their right to privacy and their right to equal protection under the law. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the law, ruling that the government has a compelling interest in maintaining a military that is composed of a broad cross-section of the population.\n\nThe case has significant implications for the way that the United States fills vacancies in its armed forces. Prior to the decision in Rostker v. Goldberg, there was some debate over whether the government could require women to register for the draft, and whether the government could require individuals to serve in the military regardless of their sexual orientation. The decision in Rostker v. Goldberg effectively settled these questions, establishing that the government has the authority to require all able-bodied individuals to serve in the military if necessary.\n\nIn this context, the practice of filling armed forces vacancies through conscription has been upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court. This means that the government has the power to require individuals to serve in the military if necessary, and that such service is not necessarily a violation of an individual's rights. However, it is worth noting that the government has not used conscription to fill armed forces vacancies since the end of the Vietnam War, instead relying on volunteers to serve in the military."

The story deals with the attempt by Moravian Church missionaries to Christianize Indians and how two brothers' lives take different paths upon their arrival on the border.  A highly romanticized account, the novel is the second in a trilogy, the first of which is \"Betty Zane\", Grey's first published work, and \"The Last Trail\", which focuses on the life of Jonathan Zane, Grey's ancestor."

    "modelText": "\n\nLourenço Mutarelli is a Brazilian author known for his works that often explore the themes of love, family, and identity. One of his most famous novels is \"Nina,\" which tells the story of a young woman who discovers her true identity after her father's death. The novel has been widely acclaimed for its poignant and emotional portrayal of the protagonist's journey of self-discovery.\n\nHowever, the novel \"Nina\" was not Mutarelli's original work. Instead, he based the novel on a true story that he came across during his research. The novel was first published in 1998, but the true story that inspired it took place many years before that.\n\nIn this essay, we will explore the history of the true story that inspired \"Nina\" and the process by which Mutarelli transformed it into a novel. We will also discuss the themes and motifs that are present in the novel and how they relate to Mutarelli's broader literary career.\n\nTo begin with, it is important to note that the true story that inspired \"Nina\" took place in the early 20th century in Brazil. The story revolves around a young woman named Nina, who was born into a family of circus performers. Nina's parents were both performers, and she was raised to follow in their footsteps. However, as she grew older, Nina began to question her identity and her place in the world.\n\nAfter her father's death, Nina embarks on a journey of self-discovery that takes her from her small town in Brazil to the big cities of Europe. Along the way, she encounters a variety of characters and experiences that help her to understand her true identity and her place in the world.\n\nMutarelli was drawn to this true story because of its themes of identity and self-discovery. He was also intrigued by the fact that the story took place in the early 20th century,"

      "Anani ben Sason. Anani ben Sason (also called 'Anani, 'Inani, and 'Inyani) was a Jewish Talmudist who lived in the Land of Israel, known as an amora of the third century, a contemporary of R. Ammi.  He rarely discussed \"Halakot\", and his discussions of them were not original (\"Shab. \" 64b).  Once he recited a \"Halakah\" in the patriarch's mansion, without naming its author, which provoked R. Ammi to ask: \"Is it his own?  It is what R. Eleazar had reported in the name of R. Oshaiah\" (M. Ḳ.  24b).  In the \"Haggadah\", he sometimes reported the sayings of others, but more often he was original.  Thus, as a reason for the juxtaposition of the regulations regarding the sacrificial rites and the priestly vestments (\"Ex. \" xxviii-xxix), he points out that the priestly vestments were to have atoning effects as well as the sacrifices.  He represents the miter as atoning for haughtiness, and cites R. Chanina as saying, \"That which rests highest on the priest atones for one's considering himself high\"; and similarly with the rest of the priestly garments (\"Zeb.\"  88b; \" 'Ar.\"  16a; compare \"Yer.

    "modelText": "\n\nThe black Indians associated with the Seminole people are a unique group of individuals with a complex history. They are descendants of African slaves who were brought to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade and later became associated with various Native American tribes. The Seminole people, in particular, have a long history of interaction with African Americans, including slaves who escaped to their territory and were later assimilated into their society.\n\nThe black Indians associated with the Seminole people have a unique cultural identity that blends elements of African and Native American cultures. They have their own distinct language, music, and traditions that reflect their mixed heritage. Despite their unique identity, the history of the black Indians associated with the Seminole people is often overlooked or marginalized in mainstream historical narratives.\n\nThe exact origins of the black Indians associated with the Seminole people are not well documented, but it is believed that they emerged during the early years of the Seminole people's history in Florida. As the Seminole people migrated to Florida from other parts of the southeastern United States, they likely encountered African slaves who had escaped from their masters and sought refuge among the Seminole. Over time, these escaped slaves were assimilated into Seminole society and became known as black Indians.\n\nThe black Indians associated with the Seminole people played an important role in the Seminole Wars, which were a series of conflicts between the Seminole people and the United States government in the early 19th century. During these wars, the black Indians fought alongside the Seminole people against American forces, and some even served as leaders in the Seminole resistance.\n\nAfter the Seminole Wars, many of the black Indians associated with the Seminole people were forced to leave their homes in Florida and relocate to other parts of the country. Some settled in other Native American communities, while others joined African American communities in the North and West. Today, the descendants of the black Indians associated with the Seminole people can be found throughout the United States, with"

Both are closely related to the concept of value investing, which is a strategy that involves buying undervalued assets and holding them for the long term. In this introduction, we will explore the concept of owner earnings and how it relates to Warren Buffett's investment philosophy.\n\nOwner earnings refer to the cash flow that a company generates from its operations, after accounting for all expenses and taxes. This metric is important because it provides a more accurate picture of a company's true earning power than traditional measures such as GAAP earnings. Owner earnings take into account the cash that a company actually receives, rather than the accrual-based earnings that are reported on financial statements.\n\nWarren Buffett is one of the most successful investors of all time, and his investment philosophy is based on the principles of value investing. Buffett has long been a proponent of owner earnings, and he has often stated that this metric is a key factor in his investment decisions. In fact, Buffett has said that he looks for companies with strong owner earnings and a durable competitive advantage, as these are the types of businesses that are likely to generate long-term value for shareholders.\n\nIn addition to his focus on owner earnings, Warren Buffett is also known for his long-term investment horizon and his discipline in avoiding speculative investments. He has said that he looks for businesses that he can understand and that have a moat, or a competitive advantage that will protect them from competitors.

The book was first published in 1935 and has since become a classic of English literature. The novel tells the story of a group of children who go on a series of adventures in the countryside, exploring the natural world and learning about life along the way.\n\nThe novel has been adapted into a number of different forms of media, including a popular children's song and a stage play. However, the question at hand is not about the novel itself, but rather about the author who wrote it. When was D.L. Sayers born?\n\nDorothy L. Sayers was born on June 13, 1893, in Oxford, England. She was the only child of a college professor and a primary school teacher, and she was raised in a household that valued education and intellectual pursuits. Sayers attended Oxford University, where she studied classical literature and languages, and she went on to become one of the most successful and respected writers of her time.\n\nIn addition to \"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush,\" Sayers wrote a number of other novels, plays, and essays, and she is perhaps best known for her series of mystery novels featuring the character Lord Peter Wimsey. These novels were highly acclaimed for their wit, their clever plotting, and their attention to detail, and they helped to establish Sayers as one of the most important writers of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction.\n\nOverall, D.L. Sayers was a highly accomplished and influential author, and her work continues to be widely read and appreciated today."

Shellite is a soft mineral with a hardness of 3.5 to 4 on the Mohs scale. It has a white or yellowish-white color and a vitreous luster.\n\nThe chemical formula of shellite is (Na2,Ca2,K2)Al2Si3O10(OH)2. This formula indicates that shellite is composed of aluminum, silicon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, and potassium. The formula also shows that shellite contains water of hydration, which is indicated by the presence of (OH)2 in the formula.\n\nThere are several components of shellite, and each component has a different chemical formula. One of the components of shellite is (ON)CHOH. The chemical formula (ON)CHOH indicates that this component of shellite is composed of oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen. The presence of nitrogen in this component of shellite is unusual, as most zeolites do not contain nitrogen.\n\nIn this essay, we will explore the component of shellite that has the formula (ON)CHOH and its properties.

Their music was characterized by its minimalist approach, with Rev playing synthesizers and Vega playing guitar and saxophone.\n\nIn 1977, Suicide released their self-titled debut album, which was critically acclaimed and is now considered a classic of the punk rock genre. The album features several notable tracks, including \"Ghost Rider,\" which is based on the comic book character of the same name.\n\nGhost Rider is a Marvel Comics superhero created by Roy Thomas, Gary Friedrich, and Mike Ploog. The character first appeared in Marvel Spotlight #5 in 1972 and has since appeared in numerous comic books, movies, and television shows. The Ghost Rider character is a stunt motorcyclist named Johnny Blaze who makes a deal with the devil, Mephisto, to save the life of his adoptive father. In exchange, Blaze agrees to serve as a demon's bounty hunter, using his supernatural powers to track down and capture rogue demons.\n\nIt is unclear how much input Vega had in the creation of the song \"Ghost Rider,\" but it is clear that the character was an inspiration for the band. The song's lyrics reference the character's powers and his deal with the devil, and the music is driven by a catchy, repetitive guitar riff.\n\nOverall, \"Ghost Rider\" is a notable track on Suicide's debut album and showcases the band's unique blend of punk rock and electronic music. The song's connection to the Marvel Comics character of the same name adds an interesting layer of pop culture significance to the track."

It provided for broad new disclosure requirements, and limited the amounts that candidates could spend on their campaigns, or that citizens could spend separate from candidate campaigns to promote their political views.  Specifically, it attempted to restrict the influence of wealthy individuals by limiting individual donations to $1,000 and donations by political action committees (PACs) to $5,000.

Columba was known for her beauty and her piety, and she was said to have founded a palace in which she died.

The palace may have been built in the 14th or 15th century, but this is only speculation as there is no concrete evidence to support this.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the palace may not have been a grand structure, as the term \"palace\" was often used to describe a large house or manor in medieval Scotland. Therefore, the palace in which Columba de Dunbar died may have been a relatively modest dwelling.\n\nDespite the lack of concrete information about the palace, it is clear that Columba de Dunbar was an important figure in Scottish history.

      "Santa Claus in film. Motion pictures featuring Santa Claus abound and apparently constitute their own subgenre of the Christmas film genre.  Early films of Santa revolve around similar simple plots of Santa's Christmas Eve visit to children.  In 1897, in a short film called \"Santa Claus Filling Stockings\", Santa Claus is simply filling stockings from his pack of toys.  Another film called \"Santa Claus and the Children\" was made in 1898.  A year later, a film directed by George Albert Smith in titled \"Santa Claus\" (or \"The Visit from Santa Claus\" in the United Kingdom) was created.  In this picture, Santa Claus enters the room from the fireplace and proceeds to trim the tree.  He then fills the stockings that were previously hung on the mantle by the children.  After walking backward and surveying his work, he suddenly darts at the fireplace and disappears up the chimney.  \"Santa Claus' Visit\" in 1900 featured a scene with two little children kneeling at the feet of their mother and saying their prayers.  The mother tucks the children snugly in bed and leaves the room.  Santa Claus suddenly appears on the roof, just outside the children's bedroom window, and proceeds to enter the chimney, taking with him his bag of presents and a little hand sled for one of the children.  He goes down the chimney and suddenly appears in the children's room through the fireplace.  He distributes the presents and mysteriously causes the appearance of a Christmas tree laden with gifts.  The scene closes with the children waking up and running to the fireplace just too late to catch him by the legs.  A 1909 film by D. W. Griffith titled \"A Trap for Santa Claus\" shows children setting a trap to capture Santa Claus as he descends the chimney, but instead capture their father who abandoned them and their mother but tries to burglarize the house after he discovers she inherited a fortune.  A twenty-nine-minute 1925 silent film production titled \"Santa Claus\", by explorer/documentarian Frank E. Kleinschmidt, filmed partly in northern Alaska, feature Santa in his workshop, visiting his Eskimo neighbors, and tending his reindeer.  A year later, another movie titled \"Santa Claus\" was produced with sound on De Forest Phonofilm.  Over the years, various actors have donned the red suit (aside from those discussed below), including Monty Woolley in \"Life Begins at Eight-thirty\" (1942), Alberto Rabagliati in \"The Christmas That Almost Wasn't\" (1966), Dan Aykroyd in \"Trading Places\" (1983), Jan Rubes in \"One Magic Christmas\" (1985), David Huddleston in \"\" (1985), Jonathan Taylor Thomas in \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" (1998), and Ed Asner in \"Elf\" (2003).

      "Extrema (band). Extrema formed in 1986 in Milan.  The initial lineup included guitarist Tommy Massara, vocalist/guitarist Andrea Boria, bassist Luca Varisco, and drummer Stefano Bullegas.  Regarded as one of Italy's first thrash metal bands, Extrema's first EP, \"We F**kin' Care\" (1987), sold an impressive 3,000 copies by word of mouth alone.  Italian heavy metal fans didn't yet seem prepared to embrace local talent, however, and the next four years saw Extrema (by then entirely re-vamped, with Massara signing on new members Gianluca Perotti on vocals, Mattia Bigi on bass, and Chris Dalla Pellegrina on drums) relegated to open for visiting acts like Slayer, D.R.I., and Corrosion of Conformity.  Finally realizing that their only hope of impressing local talent scouts lay in conquering from the outside-in, Extrema started aggressively shopping their demos to international heavy metal critics, and even financed a trip to New York City for a one-off gig.  The strategy worked, and their four-track demo from 1991 was soon making waves with some major international publications, eventually leading to a record deal with Contempo Records.  The result was the 1993's \"Tension at the Seams\" album, which led to stadium support slots with Italian rock star Vasco Rossi, and more importantly a high-profile metal festival appearance in Turin alongside Megadeth, The Cult, Suicidal Tendencies, and Metallica.  The album also featured an unconventional cover of The Police's \"Truth Hits Everybody\" and spawned a video clip for the track \"Child O' Boogaow\" which was on heavy rotation on Italy's MTV affiliate, Videomusic."

    "modelText": "\n\nScience and discovery are two fields that are closely related and intertwined. Both fields are focused on the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the natural world. In order to achieve this goal, both science and discovery rely on the use of evidence and the scientific method to validate hypotheses and theories.\n\nOne of the key principles that both science and discovery embrace is the concept of truth. Truth in science refers to the accuracy and veracity of scientific theories and hypotheses, while discovery refers to the process of uncovering new knowledge and insights through experimentation and observation.\n\nBoth fields recognize that the pursuit of truth is an ongoing process that requires constant evaluation and revision of existing theories and hypotheses. This is why both science and discovery are constantly evolving and adapting to new evidence and discoveries.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of diversity and inclusivity in both science and discovery. This has led to the development of campaigns that aim to promote diversity and inclusivity in these fields.\n\nOne such campaign is the \"Truth in Science and Discovery\" campaign, which seeks to promote the importance of truth and evidence-based research in both science and discovery. This campaign recognizes that both fields are built on the foundation of truth and that it is essential to continue to uphold this principle in order to advance our understanding of the natural world.\n\nOverall, the \"Truth in Science and Discovery\" campaign is an important initiative that highlights the importance of truth and evidence-based research in both science and discovery.

Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose.  Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument.  The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York.  Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials.  Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's.  Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location.  This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds.",
      "Spalding War Memorial. Spalding War Memorial is a First World War memorial in the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall (pronounced ) in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in eastern England.  It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens.  The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war.  She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross.  The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council.  When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested.  After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building.",
      "Maiwand Lion. The Maiwand Lion is a sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire.

Visitors to the memorial can also see from there, some of the peaks that the Indian army captured back from Pakistan.  A giant national flag, weighing 15 kg was hoisted at the Kargil war memorial to commemorate the 13th anniversary of India’s victory in the war",
      "Manchester Cenotaph. Manchester Cenotaph is a First World War memorial, with additions for later conflicts, by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter's Square in Manchester, England.  Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities—the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922.  The committee quickly raised £10,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial.  The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community.  The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church.  Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ.",

      "Devon County War Memorial. The Devon County War Memorial is a First World War memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and situated on the cathedral green in Exeter, the county town of Devon, in the south west of England.  It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city.  The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds.  After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead.  The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations.  A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials—the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens.",

    "modelText": "\n\nLighthouses are structures that have been used for centuries to aid navigation by mariners. The use of lighthouses dates back to ancient times, where the earliest lighthouses were simply bonfires built on hillsides or headlands to guide ships safely to shore. Over time, the design and construction of lighthouses evolved, and by the 18th century, lighthouses were being built with more advanced lighting systems. One of the most significant advancements in lighthouse lighting was the Argand lamp, which was patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand. The Argand lamp was a significant improvement over previous lighting systems, as it produced a brighter and more focused light, making it easier for mariners to navigate safely.\n\nThe Argand lamp was a type of oil lamp that used a wick made from fine cotton or linen fibers. The lamp was filled with oil, and the wick was soaked in the oil before being lit. The lamp was designed with a special chimney that helped to direct the flame and increase the brightness of the light. The Argand lamp was widely used in lighthouses throughout the 19th century and was eventually replaced by electric lamps in the early 20th century.\n\nDespite the fact that the Argand lamp is no longer used in lighthouses, it remains an important part of the history of lighthouse lighting. Many modern lighthouses still use lamps that are similar in design to the Argand lamp, and the principles of the Argand lamp continue to influence the design of modern lighting systems. In this context, it is not surprising that the lamp used in many lighthouses today is similar to the Argand lamp patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand."

      "William Henry Nicholls. William Henry Nicholls (23 July 1885 – 10 March 1951) was an Australian amateur botanist, authority on, and collector of Australian orchids.  An accomplished photographer and watercolourist, he contributed almost 100 articles on orchids to \"The Victorian Naturalist\", many of which described new species with line drawings.  He was working on producing a 24-volume illustrated monograph of all the orchids of Australia when he died.  Only four volumes were published shortly after his death but the entire work was published in a single book, \"Orchids of Australia\" in 1969.  Some of the many orchids described and named by Nicholls and retaining the name he gave them include \"Caladenia caudata\", \"Caladenia echidnachila\", \"Caladenia ensata\", \"Caladenia ferruginea\", \"Caladenia magniclavata\", \"Caladenia ornata\", \"Caladenia praecox\", \"Caladenia radiata\", \"Pterostylis fischii\", \"Pterostylis hamiltonii\", \"Pterostylis hildii\" and \"Pterostylis tenuissima\".",

The Australian species are found in all states but have not been recorded in the Northern Territory.  Orchids in this genus are similar to \"Caleana major\", but there are differences in the flowers and in the insects that pollinate them.  \"Paraceleana\" orchids, as well as hammer orchids (\"Drakaea\") are pollinated by male thynnid wasps.  Duck orchids have a single leaf and one or a few, dull-coloured, inconspicuous flowers.",
      "Caladenia. Caladenia, commonly known as spider orchids, is a genus of 350 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Spider orchids are terrestrial herbs with a single hairy leaf and a hairy stem.  The labellum is fringed or toothed in most species and there are small projections called calli on the labellum.  The flowers have adaptations to attract particular species of insects for pollination.  The genus is divided into three groups on the basis of flower shape, broadly, spider orchids, zebra orchids and cowslip orchids, although other common names are often used.  Although they occur in other countries, most are Australian and 136 species occur in Western Australia, making it the most species-rich orchid genus in that state.",

    "modelText": "\n\nOrchids are a diverse group of flowering plants that are known for their beauty and variety. There are over 25,000 different species of orchids, which can be found in a wide range of habitats all over the world. Two of the most well-known genera of orchids are Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya. Both of these genera are known for their stunning flowers and are popular among orchid enthusiasts. However, there is some debate about whether both of these genera are actually orchids. In this article, we will explore the characteristics of both Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya and determine whether they are both true orchids.\n\nCharacteristics of Broughtonia:\n\nBroughtonia is a genus of orchids that is native to Central and South America. It is known for its large, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, yellow, and white. Broughtonia orchids typically grow in clusters, with each flower stem producing multiple blooms. The flowers are often fragrant and can last for several weeks.\n\nCharacteristics of Laeliocattleya:\n\nLaeliocattleya is a genus of orchids that is native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is known for its large, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, yellow, and white. Laeliocattleya orchids typically grow in clusters, with each flower stem producing multiple blooms. The flowers are often long-lasting and can last for several weeks.\n\nAre Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya both orchids?\n\nBased on the characteristics of both Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya, it is clear that they are both members of the orchid family. Both genera produce large, showy flowers that grow in clusters and are often fragrant. Additionally, both Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya have characteristics that are typical of orchids, such as a single seed leaf (corm) and a distinctive flower structure."

      "Maxine's Tap Room. Maxine's Tap Room is a historic bar in Fayetteville, Arkansas, located on 107 N. Block Ave. It is one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas.  Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar in 1950 when she was 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents.  She managed to pay her parents back within the year.  In 1960 she tore down the old wooden building in which the bar had been located and had the current building—a long, narrow brick structure—built in its place.  The new building had only one window, exactly 8.5 in by 40 in , in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time.  This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins.  Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success.  Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a 50 ft -long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie.  Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000.  She died at age 82 in May 2006.  A month later the Tap Room caught fire.  Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007.  Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar.  The exposed rafters darkened by the fire were simply painted black, and a skylight was installed where the roof had burned through.  Considerable efforts were made to retain many things that had been in the bar for a very long time, such as the older lights and signs.",

      "I Love to Laugh. \"I Love to Laugh\", also called \"We Love to Laugh\", is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\".  It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself.  The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood.  (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.)  Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again.  The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well.",

In both the motion picture and the stage musical, the song is performed as a conversational duet between Bert, the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke) and George Banks (David Tomlinson).  It is operatic in nature, sung dialogue, and was highly unusual for a musical film of that era.  The song incorporates a reprise of \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" which is Mary Poppins's leitmotif.",
      "Step in Time. \"Step In Time\" is a song and dance number from Walt Disney's 1964 film \"Mary Poppins\", and it is composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The choreography for this song was provided by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood.  It is sung by Bert, the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke) and the other chimney sweeps on the rooftops of London.  In the first part of the song, the lines he says in the verses are \"Kick your knees up\", \"'Round the chimney\", \"Flap like a birdie\", \"Up on the railing\", \"Over the rooftops\" and \"Link your elbows\" followed by an interlude.  The interlude continues with Bert, Mary Poppins, Michael, Jane and all the chimney sweepers dancing around the rooftops and as Admiral Boom looks at them with the telescope, he thinks that they're Hottentots, so he orders Mr. Binnacle to make them scram with colorful fireworks.  In the second part, as all the chimney sweepers get in the house of George Banks, Mrs. Brill walks into the living room looking at them and screams, \"They're at it again!\"  and she runs away trying to strike one of the chimney sweepers with a frying pan.  As Jane, Michael, Mary Poppins and Bert get in the same place, Ellen runs around the dining room with an \"OW!\"  and the chimney sweepers flip her.  The other phrases in the rest of the musical number are \"Votes for women,\" \"It's the master,\" and \"What's all this?\"",

      "Sphaerotholus. Sphaerotholus is a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of the western United States and Canada.  To date, three species have been described: the type species, \"S. goodwini\", from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation (Late Campanian) of San Juan County, New Mexico, USA; \"S. buchholtzae\", from the Hell Creek Formation (Late Maastrichtian) of western Carter County, Montana, USA; and \"S. edmontonense\", from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada.  The etymology of \"Sphaerotholus\" is a combination of the Greek \"sphaira\", meaning \"ball\", and \"tholos\", meaning \"dome\", and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull.  The survival of \"Sphaerotholus\" from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8 million years) and a widespread distribution.  Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: \"Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node.\"  \"Sphaerotholus\" is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur.",

The Sussex chicken is a dual purpose breed of chicken that originated in England around the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43 that is a popular garden chicken in many countries.  They come in eight colours (with a couple more being developed) and have a bantam version at 1/4 size; the bantams may be any of the eight colours.",
      "Durotriges. The Durotriges were one of the Celtic tribes living in Britain prior to the Roman invasion.  The tribe lived in modern Dorset, south Wiltshire, south Somerset and Devon east of the River Axe and the discovery of an Iron Age hoard in 2009 at Shalfleet, Isle of Wight gives evidence that they lived in the western half of the island.  After the Roman conquest, their main \"civitates\", or settlement-centred administrative units, were Durnovaria (modern Dorchester, \"the probable original capital\") and Lindinis (modern Ilchester, \"whose former, unknown status was thereby enhanced\").  Their territory was bordered to the west by the Dumnonii; and to the east by the Belgae.",
      "AD 43. AD 43 (XLIII) was a common year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Vitellius (or, less frequently, year 796 \"Ab urbe condita\").  The denomination AD 43 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.",
      "Roman conquest of Britain. The Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, whose general Aulus Plautius served as first governor of Roman Britain (Latin: \"Britannia\" ).  Great Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire.  In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south.",
      "Romano-British culture. Romano-British culture is the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire following the Roman conquest in AD 43 and the creation of the province of Britannia.  It arose as a fusion of the imported Roman culture with that of the indigenous Britons, a people of Celtic language and custom.  It survived the 5th century Roman departure from Britain.  Scholars such as Christopher Snyder believe that during the 5th and 6th centuries – approximately from AD 410 when the Roman legions withdrew, to AD 597 when St Augustine of Canterbury arrived – southern Britain preserved an active sub-Roman culture that survived the attacks from the Anglo-Saxons and even used a vernacular Latin when writing.",
      "History of Wales. The history of Wales begins with the arrival of human beings in the region thousands of years ago.  Neanderthals lived in what is now Wales, or \"Cymru\" in Welsh, at least 230,000 years ago, while \"Homo sapiens\" arrived by about 31,000 BC.  However, continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period after the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC, and Wales has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age.  During the Iron Age the region, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was dominated by the Celtic Britons and the Brittonic language.  The Romans, who began their conquest of Britain in AD 43, first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the Deceangli, and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the Ordovices in 79.  The Romans departed from Britain in the 5th century, opening the door for the Anglo-Saxon invasion.  Thereafter Brittonic language and culture began to splinter, and several distinct groups formed.  The Welsh people were the largest of these groups, and are generally discussed independently of the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples after the 11th century.",
      "History of England. England became inhabited more than 800,000 years ago, as the discovery of flint tools and footprints at Happisburgh in Norfolk has revealed.  The earliest evidence for early modern humans in North West Europe, a jawbone discovered in Devon at Kents Cavern in 1927, was re-dated in 2011 to between 41,000 and 44,000 years old.  Continuous human habitation in England dates to around 13,000 years ago (see Creswellian), at the end of the last glacial period.  The region has numerous remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age, such as Stonehenge and Avebury.  In the Iron Age, England, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was inhabited by the Celtic people known as the Britons, including some Belgic tribes (e.g. the Atrebates, the Catuvellauni, the Trinovantes, etc.) in the south east.

The Atrebates were a powerful Celtic tribe that controlled a large area of land in the southeast of Britain, including parts of modern-day Berkshire, Hampshire, and Sussex. Verica was known for his alliance with the Roman Empire and his efforts to maintain peace with the neighboring tribes. However, his rule was eventually disrupted by the invasion of a rival Celtic tribe, the Cantiaci, who were supported by the Romans.

Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy.  Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included.  Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures.  This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it.  If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views.  When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others.  You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances.  According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you.  How others treat you will determine how you see yourself.  How you see yourself will determine who you are.\"",

      "List of songs recorded by Syd Barrett. English musician Syd Barrett recorded many songs during his short career as a musician.  One of the founding members of English rock band Pink Floyd, he was the dominant force of the band in their early years, writing most of the material found on their first album, \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\", contributing to their second one, \"A Saucerful of Secrets\", and recording several unreleased songs with the band.  Due to increasing mental illness, Barrett was excluded from Pink Floyd in April 1968 and was subsequently replaced by guitarist David Gilmour.

      "Who Can See It. \"Who Can See It\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1973 album \"Living in the Material World\".  The lyrics reflect Harrison's uneasy feelings towards the Beatles' legacy, three years after the group's break-up, and serve as his statement of independence from expectations raised by the band's unprecedented popularity.  Some music critics and biographers suggest that he wrote the song during a period of personal anguish, following the acclaim he had received as a solo artist with the 1970 triple album \"All Things Must Pass\" and his 1971–72 Bangladesh aid project.  The revelatory nature of the lyrics has encouraged comparisons between \"Living in the Material World\" and John Lennon's primal therapy-inspired 1970 release, \"Plastic Ono Band\".",
      "See Yourself. \"See Yourself\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1976 album \"Thirty Three & 1/3\".  Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD.  McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity.  In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions.  Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks \"Within You Without You\" and \"All You Need Is Love\"."

The impetus for the series, according to Arkoff was, \"what it would be like if you made \"Rebel Without a Cause\" today.

Originally, Arkoff wanted to call the series, \"Raging Hormones\" but Showtime decided on \"Rebel Highway\" instead.  Arkoff and Hill invited several directors to pick a title from one of Samuel Arkoff's movies, hire their own writers and create a story that could resemble the original if they wanted.  In addition, they had the right to a final cut and select their own director of photography and the editor.  Each director was given a $1.3 million budget and 12 days to shoot it with a cast of young, up and coming actors and actresses.  According to Arkoff, the appeal to directors was that, \"They weren't hampered by big studios saying, 'You can't do this or that.'  And all the directors paid very close attention to the detail of the era.  We want these shows to be fun for the younger generation and fun for the older generation\".",

He translated texts from various languages, including Latin, Greek, and Arabic, into French. His translations covered a wide range of historical topics, including ancient civilizations, medieval history, and early modern history.\n\nBousquet's translation of the historian's work was significant because it made the historian's work accessible to a wider audience. The historian's work was originally written in a language that was not widely spoken or understood, and Bousquet's translation made it possible for people to read and appreciate the historian's work in their native language.\n\nThe heritage of the historian whose work Bousquet translated is not explicitly mentioned in the title. However, it can be inferred that the historian was from a culture or ethnicity other than French, as Bousquet's translation work was focused on making historical texts accessible to a wider audience beyond the borders of France.\n\nOverall, Georges-Henri Bousquet's translation work played an important role in making historical texts accessible to a wider audience, and his translation of the work of a historian from a particular heritage contributed to the dissemination of knowledge across cultural and linguistic boundaries."

      "Asthma-related microbes. Chronic Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma.  These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma.  Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood.  These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV).  Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age.  HRV on the other hand is an important cause of bronchiolitis and is strongly associated with asthma development.  In children and adults with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma.

The town is small in size but it has many smaller settlements and ranches under municipality jurisdiction.  The people of Parás live of ranching and agriculture.  The population is not large at all due to the amount of people who fleeted throughout the years to the U.S. seeking employment.  The town is usually at its fullest of capacity during American holidays when its residents go back home.  It is well known for the increasing amount of whitetail deer, bringing in hunters from all over.  It is also known for its local festivities, the biggest being on the following Saturday of its anniversary February 17.  The town celebrates by making a \"cabalgata\" a horse trail ride from its neighboring town Agualeguas back to the town.  The festival has many of the town's traditional dishes example: Pansaje, cabrito en sangre, dulce de frijol, tamales de venado, milk candies, sweet bread, etc.  Then at night the day comes to an end with a dance at the Club Femenil in front of the town's plaza with live music Norteno bands like Los Rancheritos del Topo Chico or an Orchestra band like JLB y Cia.  The plaza is popular being located in the center of the town surrounded by two churches, the dance hall, food marts, elementary school and the city hall.",
      "List of largest pharmaceutical settlements. The following is a list of the 20 largest settlements reached between the United States Department of Justice and pharmaceutical companies from 1991 to 2012, ordered by the size of the total settlement.  The settlement amount includes both the civil (False Claims Act) settlement and criminal fine.  Glaxo's $3 billion settlement included the largest civil, False Claims Act settlement on record, and Pfizer’s $2.3 billion settlement including a record-breaking $1.3 billion criminal fine.  Legal claims against the pharmaceutical industry have varied widely over the past two decades, including Medicare and Medicaid fraud, off-label promotion, and inadequate manufacturing practices.  With respect to off-label promotion, specifically, a federal court recognized off-label promotion as a violation of the False Claims Act for the first time in Franklin v. Parke-Davis, leading to a $430 million settlement.",
      "Tell El Sakan. Tell El Sakan was an important ancient Egyptian maritime settlement during the early Bronze Age, situated at the mouth of wadi Ghazzeh.  Its geographical situation endowed it with a position of importance at the crossroads on the land based trade routes to Arabia, the Egyptian empire to the south and the Canaan region to the north.  The site (dated between 3500-2350 BCE) appears to be the predecessor to the Tell al-'Ajjul settlement, where geomorphological dynamics of the estuary caused settlement trans-location or abandonment.  The site dates from a period prior to the Egyptian military domination of the Levant.  The pottery finds at Tell es-Sakan along with Tell al-'Ajjul shows a strong ancient Egyptian link to the area, while the Bronze Age settlement at Taur Ikhbeineh has revealed a more localised pottery production with Egyptian-Canaanite interaction.",

    "question": "Considered the strongest recorded tropical cyclone, which cyclone had a film made about it in 2007?",
    "answer": "1999 Odisha cyclone",
    "document": [
      "1999 Odisha cyclone. The 1999 Odisha cyclone (IMD designation BOB 03, JTWC designation 05B) was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean and among the most destructive in the region.  The 1999 Odisha cyclone organized into a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on 25 October, though its origins could be traced back to an area of storms in the Sulu Sea four days prior.  The disturbance gradually strengthened as it took a west-northwesterly path, reaching cyclonic storm strength the next day.  Taking advantage of highly favorable conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining super cyclonic storm intensity on 28 October before peaking with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and a record-low pressure of 912 mbar (hPa; 26.93 inHg).  The storm maintained this intensity as it made landfall on Odisha on 29 October.  The cyclone steadily weakened due to persistent land interaction and dry air, remaining quasi-stationary for two days before slowly drifting offshore as a much weaker system; the storm dissipated on 1 November over the Bay of Bengal.",
      "Cyclone Gonu. Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu (also simply known as Cyclone Gonu) is the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Arabian Sea, and is also the strongest named cyclone in the northern Indian Ocean.  The second named tropical cyclone of the 2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gonu developed from a persistent area of convection in the eastern Arabian Sea on June 1, 2007.  With a favorable upper-level environment and warm sea surface temperatures, it rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of 235 km/h (145 mph) on June 4, according to the India Meteorological Department.  Gonu weakened after encountering dry air and cooler waters, and early on June 6, it made landfall on the easternmost tip of Oman, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the Arabian Peninsula.  It then turned northward into the Gulf of Oman, and dissipated on June 7 after making landfall in southern Iran, the first landfall in the country since 1898.",
      "Cyclone Donna. Severe Tropical Cyclone Donna was the strongest off-season South Pacific tropical cyclone on record during the month of May.  The twenty-first tropical disturbance, third named storm, and second severe tropical cyclone of the annual cyclone season, Donna formed from an area of disturbed weather that was first monitored west-northwest of Fiji on 1 May 2017.  The disturbance drifted eastward amid an increasingly favorable environment, and it was designated Tropical Depression 21F late on 2 May.  Twelve hours later, it intensified into a Category 1 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale and was designated Tropical Cyclone Donna as the storm's motion shifted west and then south.  After reaching its initial peak as a Category 4 cyclone early on 6 May, the effects of wind shear and upwelling caused the storm to weaken.  However, it reintensified into a Category 5 cyclone on 8 May.  Soon after, Donna entered a region of strong westerly flow and began to rapidly weaken.  Continuing to accelerate in a southerly direction, Donna eventually weakened into a tropical low on 10 May.  By 16 May, Donna's remnants had fully dissipated.",
      "Cyclone Anne. Severe Tropical Cyclone Anne was one of the most intense tropical cyclones within the South Pacific basin during the 1980s.  The cyclone was first noted on January 5, 1988 as a weak tropical depression to the northeast of Tuvalu, in conjunction with the future Typhoon Roy in the North-Western Pacific basin.  Over the next few days, the system gradually developed while moving southwestward.  Once it became a tropical cyclone, it was named Anne on January 8.  The next day, Anne rapidly intensified, becoming the fourth major tropical cyclone to affect Vanuatu within four years.  On January 11, Anne peaked in intensity while it was equivalent to a Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, and a Category 4 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.  After turning southward on January 12, Anne struck New Caledonia, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the French Overseas Territory.  The system subsequently weakened as it started to interact with Tropical Cyclone Agi.  Anne weakened into a depression and was last noted on January 14 to the south-east of New Caledonia.",
      "Cyclone Esau. Severe Tropical Cyclone Esau became the strongest tropical cyclone to affect New Caledonia on record during February and March 1992.  A shallow tropical depression developed within the monsoon trough during 24 February, about 370  km (230 mi) to the northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu.  Over the next day the system gradually developed further as it moved towards the south-west under the influence of a northerly steering flow, before it passed over Pentecost Island in northern Vanuatu during 25 February.  After passing over Pentecost the system continued to move towards the southwest and passed near the island of Malampa, before the depression turned northwards and executed a small clockwise loop as it passed over the island of Espiritu Santo.  The system was subsequently named Esau during 26 February, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone.  Over the next couple of days the system moved south-westwards towards Australia and away from the islands of Vanuatu.  Esau subsequently executed a second clockwise loop during 28 February, before it peaked as a Category 4 tropical cyclone on both the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.  After it had peaked the system moved south-eastwards and threatened Southern Vanuatu, before turning southwards and threatening the French overseas territory of New Caledonia.  Esau made landfall on the French territory during 4 March, as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone before degenerating into an extratropical cyclone during 5 March.  The systems remnants made landfall on New Zealand's North Island during 8 March, before they were last noted during the next day over the South Pacific Ocean.",
      "Cyclone Kesiny. Tropical Cyclone Kesiny was the first recorded tropical cyclone – the equivalent of a minimal hurricane – to make landfall in the month of May 2002 in the south-west Indian Ocean.  The final named storm of the busy 2001–02 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Kesiny formed on May 2 from a trough near the equator.  Its formation was the result of an increase in the Madden–Julian oscillation, which also contributed to a twin storm in the north Indian Ocean that hit Oman, and another set of storms in northeast and southeast Indian Ocean.  Kesiny initially moved to the southeast, but later turned to the southwest due to a strengthening ridge.  On May 6, it intensified into a tropical cyclone, but later weakened and was not expected to re-strengthen.  However, Kesiny developed an eye and re-intensified into a tropical cyclone on May 9, reaching peak winds of 130 km/h before striking Madagascar about 60 km southeast of Antsiranana.  It weakened while crossing the country, and after turning to the south it struck the country again before dissipating on May 11.",
      "Cyclone Hondo. Intense Tropical Cyclone Hondo (JTWC designation: 16S) was the strongest and longest lived tropical cyclone to develop during the 2007–08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season.  The third tropical cyclone and first intense tropical cyclone of the season, Hondo developed out of a tropical disturbance in early February about 1,020 km (635 mi) east-southeast of Diego Garcia.  The disturbance quickly strengthened, becoming a moderate tropical storm on February 4 and a severe tropical storm the following day.  After a brief period of slower intensification, Hondo rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone and reached its peak intensity with winds of 215 km/h (130 mph ) on February 7.  The cyclone gradually weakened over the next several days due to an increase in forward speed and a decrease in sea surface temperatures.  On February 12, Hondo rapidly degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area.  Over the following week, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwest direction with no development.  On February 20, about 2,780 km (1,725 mi) northeast of where the final advisories were issued, the storm began to regenerate.  The next day, advisories were issued on Tropical Disturbance Ex-Hondo, which briefly strengthened into a tropical depression.  However, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Hondo continued to strengthen and attained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph ) before passing directly over Réunion.  Interaction with the island caused the storm to weaken and degenerate into a remnant low once more.  The storm dissipated on February 29 after executing a counterclockwise loop.",
      "2002–03 Australian region cyclone season. The 2002–03 Australian region cyclone season included Cyclone Inigo, which tied Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 as the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian basin.  It began on 1 November 2002 and ended on 30 April 2003.  The regional tropical cyclone operational plan also defines a \"tropical cyclone year\" separately from a \"tropical cyclone season\", which runs from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003.  These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Australian region, which is defined as in the southern hemisphere between 90°E and 180°E.  The season's ten tropical depressions existed within these dates, with the first, designated as Tropical Cyclone 07S, entering the basin on 27 December 2002.  The last system, Cyclone Epi, dissipated on 6 June 2003.  Tropical cyclones in this area were monitored by four Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs): the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) in Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane and one in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.",
      "2010–11 South Pacific cyclone season. The 2010–11 South Pacific cyclone season was a slightly below average tropical cyclone season, with seven tropical cyclones and five severe tropical cyclones developing during the season.  The season ran from November 1, 2010 until April 30, 2011, though if any tropical cyclones had developed between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011, the official \"tropical cyclone year\", they would have been counted towards the season's total.  Within the South Pacific basin tropical cyclones were officially monitored by the Fiji Meteorological Service's Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji, north of 25°S, and to the south the Meteorological Service of New Zealand's Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand.  Any disturbances forming in the region were designated with a sequential number suffixed by the letter F.  In addition, the United States Military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center unofficially monitored parts of the basin during the season, where any systems judged to have achieved tropical storm strength or greater received a number suffixed with the letter P. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measure wind speeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over a period of one minute which can be applied to the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.  Seven named storms formed or moved into the South Pacific basin during the 2010–11 season, the strongest of which was Severe Tropical Cyclone Wilma in late January.",
      "2011–12 South Pacific cyclone season. The 2011–12 South Pacific cyclone season was one of the least active South Pacific tropical cyclone seasons on record, with only three tropical cyclones occurring during the season.  The season ran from November 1, 2011 to April 30, 2012, however, any tropical cyclones that form before June 30, 2012 would have fallen within the 2011–12 tropical cyclone year and would have counted towards the season total.  The strongest and only severe tropical cyclone that occurred during the season was Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasmine, which tracked in from out of the South Pacific basin.  Within the basin, tropical cyclones are monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand.  RSMC Nadi attaches an F designation to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the South Pacific.  The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues unofficial warnings within the South Pacific, designating tropical storm-equivalent or greater tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix.  RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measure windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over a period of one minute and uses the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale."
