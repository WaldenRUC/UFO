{"question": "What happens to you if you eat watermelon seeds?", "answer": "The watermelon seeds pass through your digestive system", "mgt": "If you eat watermelon seeds, they typically pass through your digestive system unharmed and are not absorbed by your body. Watermelon seeds are rich in nutrients, including protein, healthy fats, and fiber. Here's a brief overview of what can happen when you eat watermelon seeds:\n\n1. Digestion: After swallowing, watermelon seeds enter your stomach where they are mixed with digestive enzymes. The tough outer shell of the seed will eventually be broken down by stomach acids, allowing the edible part inside to pass through.\n\n2. Poop: The edible part of the watermelon seed, known as the white or black kernel, is usually soft and easy to digest. After passing through the digestive tract, the seeds will move into the intestines, where they are further broken down before being eliminated in your stool.\n\n3. Potential for germination: If the watermelon seeds are not fully mature and have an intact shell, they may have a small chance of germinating when they come into contact with moisture and适宜 conditions (such as warm temperatures, proper soil, and adequate light). This will result in a small sprout growing from the seed.\n\n4. Appetite suppression: Some people believe that consuming watermelon seeds can aid in appetite suppression due to their high fiber content, which can help you feel full for a longer period.\n\n5. Chewing or swallowing: If you chew watermelon seeds before swallowing, they can provide a mild, nutty flavor and may help with oral health by stimulating saliva production.\n\nRemember, though, watermelon seeds are not a source of significant nutrients like vitamins or minerals when consumed raw.

You might be accustomed to spitting them out as you eat — seed spitting contest, anyone? Some people just opt for seedless. But the nutritional value of watermelon seeds may convince you otherwise. Watermelon seeds are low in calories and are nutrient dense. When roasted, they’re crispy and can easily take the place of other unhealthy snack options. One ounce of watermelon seed kernels contains approximately 158 calories. That’s not much lower than an ounce of Lay’s Potato Chips (160 calories), but let’s take a look at what constitutes an ounce. A large handful of watermelon seeds weighs about 4 grams and contains about just 23 calories. Far less than a bag of potato chips! One of several minerals found in watermelon seeds is magnesium. In a 4-gram serving, you’ll get 21 mg of magnesium, which is 5 percent of the daily value. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends adults get 420 mg of this mineral daily. Magnesium is essential for many of the body’s metabolic functions. It’s also required to maintain nerve and muscle function, as well as immune, heart, and bone health. A handful of watermelon seeds contains about 0.29 mg of iron, or about 1.6 percent of the daily value. It might not seem like much, but the NIH only recommends adults get 18 mg in their day. Iron is an important component of hemoglobin — carrying oxygen through the body. It also helps your body convert calories into energy. However, watermelon seeds contain phytate, which decreases the absorption of iron and reduces their nutritional value. Watermelon seeds also provide a good source of both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids — one large handful (4 grams) provides 0.3 and 1.1 grams, respectively. According to the American Heart Association, these fats are useful in protecting against heart attack and stroke, and lowering levels of “bad” cholesterol in the blood. Watermelon seeds are also good source of zinc. They provide about 26 percent of the daily value in one ounce, or 4 percent DV in one large handful (4 grams). Zinc is an important nutrient, essential to the immune system. It’s also necessary for: However, just like with iron, phytates reduce the absorption of zinc. Roasting watermelon seeds is easy. Set your oven at 325°F and place the seeds on a baking sheet. It should only take about 15 minutes for them to roast, but you may want to stir them halfway through to ensure an even crispiness. You can make the seeds taste even better by adding a little olive oil and salt, or sprinkling them with cinnamon and a light dusting of sugar. If you prefer more flavor, you can add lime juice and chili powder, or even cayenne pepper. Watermelon seeds have many health benefits. Although the amounts of some minerals and vitamins within them may seem low, they are still far preferable to potato chips and other unhealthy snacks. How much nutrition you reap from watermelon seeds depends largely on how many you eat. Because they’re small, you need to eat quite a few to get their considerable benefits. However, when you compare their nutritional value to that of other snacks, watermelon seeds come out far ahead.

Let's get the most pressing point out of the way first — the historical roots of fortune cookies are not Chinese at all. Instead, research points to Japan as the source of what would become fortune cookies as they are known today. According to researcher Yasuko Nakamachi — who was interviewed by Jennifer 8. Lee, author of The Fortune CookieChronicles – fortune cookies can trace their origins to bakeries outside of Kyoto, Japan. Nakamachi's proof lies in family bakeries that surround Kyoto and the fact that they made fortune cookie-shaped crackers. Further, there is visual evidence (an image from the 1870s) that shows a baker making them in his bakery. Nakamachi first saw fortune cookies while in a Chinese restaurant in New York City, but after seeing someone making them at a bakery in Japan — complete with a piece of paper tucked inside — it set her off on a quest to find the fortune cookie's true origins. The main differences between Japanese and American fortune cookies, she found, were in the size, the flavoring, and the position of the fortune. These Japanese cookies were bigger, used sesame and miso (not vanilla and butter), and had the fortunes pinched in the mouth (not folded inside).

While the idea of a fortune cookie is not Chinese in origin, when it comes to the actual fortune part of the fortune cookie, there is some evidence that suggests that it did indeed come from China. Sources point to the mid-autumn moon festival, which is celebrated on the 15th day of the eighth month on the Chinese calendar. On this day, mooncakes were distributed widely. The cakes, which were made with a lotus nut paste, were avoided by the Mongol overlords because they didn't like the taste. The Chinese used this to their advantage, hiding instructions for rebellion inside the mooncakes and sending priests inside the occupied city's walls to distribute them. Once the instructions were distributed, the rebels were able to surprise the Mongols and overthrow them. This well-thought out plan and hard-fought victory led to the establishment of the storied Ming Dynasty, which ruled from 1368 all the way until 1644 C.E., when the Qing Dynasty took over following the last Ming Emperor Chóngzhēn's suicide (via History).

The cakes, which were made with a lotus nut paste, were avoided by the Mongol overlords because they didn't like the taste. The Chinese used this to their advantage, hiding instructions for rebellion inside the mooncakes and sending priests inside the occupied city's walls to distribute them. Once the instructions were distributed, the rebels were able to surprise the Mongols and overthrow them. This well-thought out plan and hard-fought victory led to the establishment of the storied Ming Dynasty, which ruled from 1368 all the way until 1644 C.E., when the Qing Dynasty took over following the last Ming Emperor Chóngzhēn's suicide (via History). While the cookie's historic roots can be traced to Japan, and the idea of the fortune inside a cookie can be traced even further back to 1300s China, the fortune cookie known today is believed to have been invented in 1900s California. Japanese immigration to the United States was a slow and steady process, with communities slowly popping up in various places (such as Japan Town in San Francisco) along the West Coast. As the 1900s began, more and more Japanese people started moving stateside, taking jobs first on farms or other places of hard labor. Some eventually were able to open their own businesses, and more, leading to even more population growth. It is within this context that fortune cookies were invented. There are two sites that claim ownership over the founding city of the fortune cookie. On one hand, you have San Francisco, and on the other, you have Los Angeles (via American Heritage). Both cities had growing (and engaged) Japanese populations in the early 1900s, with plenty of places — bakeries, for example — where the cookies may have originated.

Like many famous foods/objects/really anything throughout history, the actual inventor of the fortune cookie is a hotly contested subject. There are two main contenders for the title of fortune cookie inventor. First, there is Makoto Hagiwara. Hagiwara was a Japanese immigrant who was (as of 1895) employed as the caretaker for San Francisco's Japanese Tea Gardens. Then, sometime between 1907 and 1909, Hagiwara began serving cookies based on Japanese senbei (toasted rice wafers) to visitors of the garden. Allegedly, the cookies contained thank you notes which acknowledged the public for having him re-hired at the gardens after Mayor James Phelan — who was a known racist and hated people of Asian descent — fired him. The second contender is David Jung, a Los Angeleno who founded the Hong Kong Noodle Company in 1916. Originally from Canton, China, Jung had claimed that he invented the fortune cookie around 1918 when he would give cookies to out-of-work people that contained scripture messages of hope and persistence. The thing about this claim, though, is that there is no physical evidence left to prove that Jung did invent the cookie.

In an effort to put the Los Angeles–San Francisco rivalry to rest and state for the record who actually invented the fortune cookie, the Court of Historical Review – a San Francisco-based organization — held a trial in 1983. Shockingly — or perhaps not, if you consider where the Court of Historical Review is based – it was decided that Makoto Hagiwara was the inventor and the city of San Francisco the home of the fortune cookie. During the trial, the man overseeing the case (a real federal judge named Daniel M. Hanlon), was allegedly given a fortune cookie that read, \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. not very smart cookie.\" It is one thing to hold a \"trial\" to decide an answer to something like the founding of a food, but no matter how you look at it, the trial was a product of the time. Participants in the trial not only donned clothing designed to look like ancient Chinese robes, but they also spoke in a pidgin English while recounting each claimant's history of the cookie. (Other evidence was issued as well, such as a set of grills that were used to create the cookies.) To this day, San Franciscans and Angelenos still don't agree on who actually invented the fortune cookie.

Fortune cookies as a staple in American Chinese restaurants really took hold in and around World War II. This transition from Japanese-American to Chinese-American prominence, though, is not because of a happy, seamless, peaceful shift. During World War II, Japanese-Americans were put in internment camps in the United States (this was a response by President Franklin Roosevelt and the U.S. government to the attack on Pearl Harbor). Without Japanese-Americans producing fortune cookies, it was during this time that enterprising Chinese businessmen decided to start making cookies of their own and selling them to Chinese restaurants. This started the proliferation of fortune cookies that has maintained a steady increase through the present day. When soldiers came home from war — and even more so as American families began to dine out in the 1950s and beyond — the wish for something sweet after dinner was great. And since Chinese cuisine did not have many sweet dessert options (compared to, say, French or Italian cuisines), restaurateurs offered up Fortune cookies, which were promptly cracked open and gobbled up.

From the time of their invention in the early 1900s through the middle of the century, fortune cookies were made by hand. Once mixed, fortune cookie dough would be poured onto a tray, heated, and shaped as the fortunes were put inside. While it only takes about a minute to cook fortune cookies, this time really adds up when you're doing the entire process by hand. This process was kept up until one enterprising man by the name of Edward Louie. Louie, who opened San Francisco's Lotus Fortune Cookie Company in 1946, decided he needed to find a way to save his family the trouble of individually wrapping hundreds if not thousands of fortunes cookies every day. He set to work and in the 1960s invented a machine that automated the process by inserting the fortune cookie and folding it together. This machine allowed Lotus to create up to 90,000 fortune cookies per day, further boosting the ability to find fortune cookies far and wide.

The world of fortune cookie production has come a long way since the early 1900s when they were made by hand. Even with the advent of fortune cookie automation — which boosted production to 90,000 cookies per day — it is nothing compared to the number of cookies being produced currently. In total, around 3 billion fortune cookies are produced per year. That's an average of around nine cookies per person in the United States per year. Now, these are not only intended for Chinese restaurants. In fact, fortune cookies have been used as a promotional device for a variety of things for years. The movie Kung Fu Panda 3, for example, created a slew of fortune cookies with quotations from the movie's protagonist Po (voiced by Jack Black). Before Kung Fu Panda, other movies such as Billy Wilder's 1966 comedy The Fortune Cookie (starring Walter Matthau and Jack Lemon in their first on-screen collaboration) also used fortune cookies as promotional items.

In the wide world of fortune cookies, there is one cookie company to rule them all, so to speak. While there are a number of companies who produce fortune cookies (there are larger manufacturers such as Los Angeles's Peking and Baily International Food of Illinois as well as many smaller businesses), Wonton Food Incorporated sits atop the fortune cookie heap. A family-owned company that was started in 1973 by Ching Sun Wong (who immigrated from Guangdong, China in the 1960s), Wonton Food has established itself as the worldwide leader in fortune cookie production, churning out over 4.5 million cookies per day. Wonton Food currently produces four flavors of fortune cookie — vanilla, citrus, chocolate, and tri-flavor, a mixture of the previous three. In addition to their fortune cookie mastery, Wonton Food also is a leader in other Chinese foodstuffs, producing a variety of dry and crispy noodles, wrappers for different types of rolls, soy and mung bean sprouts, and more.

This may or may not come as a surprise, but much of what you may consider Chinese food in the United States is not actually consumed in China. A slew of dishes that grace just about every Chinese food menu in the states — which the dishes may be able to sort of trace roots to authentic Chinese cuisine — were actually invented in the states to appease the American palate at the time of invention. Chop Suey is a prime example of this. Said to be created during the California Gold Rush for intoxicated miners, the dish became synonymous with \"Chinese cuisine\" for a very long time. (It is safe to say that General Tso's chicken, which was created in New York City in the 1970s, has since taken that mantle.) Fortune cookies are no different. These sweet treats, which were invented in California, hardly if ever show up at the end of a meal in China. Wonton Food Inc, the largest producer of fortune cookies in the world, attempted to expand business to China in the 1990s, but the effort did not produce results. Instead of fortune cookies, dinner in China is more likely to finish with orange slices.

Part of the beauty of the fortune cookie is in its simplicity — open the wrapper, break the cookie open, find your fortune, eat the cookie. Four things create the ritual that has not changed much since its inception a century ago. Another thing that is simple about the fortune cookie? The recipe. In its essence, fortune cookies contain four basic ingredients – flour, sugar, water, and eggs. With these, fortune cookies can be made. These, of course, are the basis for many baked goods, but if they're all you've got, you're on your way. If you are making them at home, you might be adding a few other ingredients as well. A flavoring agent, such as vanilla or almond extract, is a popular addition, as are butter and a little bit of salt. On the commercial level, though, more ingredients are added so that the cookies will not spoil on their journey to Chinese restaurants nationwide. These ingredients include anticaking agents, stabilizing agents, baking powder, and baking soda — no one wants to find a gummed-up or broken fortune cookie in the bottom of their to-go bag.

Even though it produces the most fortune cookies in the world, Wonton Food — for more than 30 years — only employed one fortune writer. That man, Donald Lau, was chosen because of his command of the English language (Lau now also serves as the chief financial officer and vice president) and continued to write multiple fortunes a day for 30 years. When Lau took over writing fortunes in the 1980s, the company had only a couple hundred to choose from. Lau rewrote and refreshed the ones they had and continued to add more. Now, Wonton Food's fortune library numbers over 10,000. What started out very similar to the current fortunes evolved, and Lau began using dry wit and everyday observances to craft fortunes. These he would test on friends and coworkers and if they passed, the fortunes would likely make it into a cookie. In 2017, he retired from fortune writing and passed the duties on to Wonton Food Assistant Vice President James Wong, the nephew of the founder of Wonton Food.

Okay, so considering your fortune may sometimes read \"you will find the love of your life\" or some other such platitude, it might be hard to believe that the numbers contained on fortunes are lucky, but research says that they actually might be. In 2017, statistics website FiveThirtyEight bought 1,035 Panda-brand cookies in order to analyze the lucky numbers held within. There were 676 unique fortunes in the lot and 556 combinations of lucky numbers. Then, they analyzed the Powerball numbers for every drawing between Nov. 1, 1997 and May 27, 2017. The results were surprising. If a person bought a ticket every day during that time, they would've spent $4.2 million. Then, if they used every possible combination, they would've netted a grand total of around $4.4 million dollars. If they had used random numbers in that time, they would've only won $1.7 million (while still spending $4.2 million). In fact, there was even a brief investigation into Wonton Food when, on March 30, 2005, over 100 people from 29 states got five of six numbers right, netting the group over $19 million dollars total.

It’s customary in many restaurants for diners to receive a small treat with their check: mints, hard candy and sometimes even chocolate. But at many Chinese restaurants around the United States, patrons get something a little different: a Pac-Man-shaped, vanilla-flavored cookie containing a finger-sized slip of paper printed with a pithy fortune or aphorism. While many Americans associate these fortune cookies with Chinese restaurants—and by extension, Chinese culture—they are actually more readily traceable to 19th-century Japan and 20th-century America. As far back as the 1870s, some confectionary shops near Kyoto, Japan carried a cracker with the same folded shape and a fortune tucked into the bend, instead of its hollow inside. It’s called the “tsujiura senbei,” or “fortune cracker,” according to Jennifer 8. Lee, author of The Fortune Cookie Chronicles: Adventures in the World of Chinese Food, which recounts the history of the cookie. The Japanese cracker, Lee wrote, was larger and darker, made with sesame and miso instead of the vanilla and butter used to flavor fortune cookies found in modern Chinese restaurants in America. Lee cited Japanese researcher Yasuko Nakamachi, who said she found these cookies at a generations-old family bakery near a popular Shinto shrine just outside of Kyoto in the late 1990s. Nakamachi also uncovered storybooks from 1878 with illustrations of an apprentice who worked in a senbei store making the tsujiura senbei, along with other kinds of crackers. Lee says the fortune cookie likely arrived in the United States along with Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii and California between the 1880s and early 1900s, after the Chinese Exclusion Act’s expulsion of Chinese workers left a demand for cheap labor. Japanese bakers set up shop in places such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, making miso and sesame-flavored “fortune cookie-ish” crackers, among other treats. One of the most oft-repeated origin stories of the American fortune cookie cites the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park as the first known U.S. restaurant to serve the treat. The Tea Garden sourced their cookies from a local bakery called Benkyodo, which claims to have pioneered the vanilla and butter flavoring and to have invented a machine sometime around 1911 to mass-produce the cookies. But, says Lee, several other sources have also claimed to invent the cookie around the same time, including three Los Angeles-based immigrant-run businesses: Fugetsu-Do confectionary in the city’s Little Tokyo, Japanese snack manufacturer Umeya and the Hong Kong Noodle Company. READ MORE: History of San Francisco's Chinatown WATCH: How Japanese Americans Were Forced Into Concentration Camps During WWII How did fortune cookies migrate from Japanese bakeries to Chinese restaurants? American food preferences likely played a part. Japanese emigres to the U.S. around the turn of the 20th century couldn’t open Japanese restaurants, says Lee, because Americans didn’t want to eat raw fish. “So in many cases, they actually opened Chinese restaurants because they were kind of going through a big renaissance with chop suey, chow mein, egg foo young.” And Americans' expectation for dessert at the end of meals, says Lee, may explain why many of these restaurants began to offer fortune cookies with the check. But the fortune cookie, once produced by Japanese Americans, eventually wound up in the hands of Chinese American manufacturers during World War II. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941 and President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans through his Executive Order 9066, Japanese American businesses began to close, including the bakeries that once made fortune cookies. That gave Chinese American entrepreneurs an opening to produce and sell them. More than 100 years later, fortune cookies remain a massive business. New York-based Wonton Food, the largest fortune-cookie producer, manufactures more than 4 million of them daily, with an estimated 3 billion cookies produced annually, wrote Lee. READ MORE: Building the Transcontinental Railroad: How 20,000 Chinese Americans Made it Happen As fortune cookies became a staple in Chinese restaurants, they also became fodder for ethnic stereotyping. Despite having historic roots in Japan and growing into a uniquely American business success story, the cookies became an easy shorthand for all things Chinese—along with other reductive and sometimes disparaging pop-culture stereotypes like squinty eyes, heavy accents and being good at math. In 2012 for example, MSG Network aired a fan sign of the New York Knick’s Taiwanese American basketball sensation Jeremy Lin, overlaying his face above a broken fortune cookie. The same year, ice cream makers Ben & Jerry’s briefly offered a “Taste the Lin-sanity”-themed frozen yogurt, complete with broken fortune cookies, before an outcry forced them to publicly apologize and remove the cookies from the recipe. Using things like fortune cookies and takeout boxes as shorthands for Chinese culture is misleading, says Lee, given that they’re distinctly American inventions—and the global reach of American culture helps to perpetuate those stereotypes around the world. But despite misconceptions about its true origins and its misuse as a symbol of Chinese heritage, the fortune cookie still carries powerful resonance throughout American culture. “You have the number of people who have been engaged through fortune cookies, you have fortune cookie little baby booties, fortune cookie jewelry,” says Lee. “It really speaks to Americans in a very profound way.” READ MORE: The 8-Year-Old Chinese American Girl Who Helped Desegregate Schools—in 1885 By: Michael Lee We strive for accuracy and fairness.

All Rights Reserved.", "A fortune cookie is a crisp and sugary cookie wafer made from flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil with a piece of paper inside, a \"fortune\", an aphorism, or a vague prophecy. The message inside may also include a Chinese phrase with translation and/or a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers. Fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries, but they are not Chinese in origin. The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, though various immigrant groups in California claim to have popularized them in the early 20th century. They most likely originated from cookies made by Japanese immigrants to the United States in the late 19th or early 20th century. The Japanese version did not have the Chinese lucky numbers and were eaten with tea. Globally, the cookies are generally called by the English term fortune cookies, being American in origin. There is no single accepted Chinese name for the cookies, with a large variety of translations being used to describe them in the Chinese language, all of which being more-or-less literal translations of the English \"fortune cookie\". Examples include: 幸运籤饼 xìngyùn qiān bǐng \"good luck lot cookie\", 籤语饼 qiān yǔ bǐng \"fortune words cookie\", 幸运饼 xìngyùn bǐng \"good luck cookie\", 幸运籤语饼 xìngyùn qiān yǔ bǐng \"lucky fortune words cookie\", 幸运甜饼 xìngyùn tián bǐng \"good luck sweet cookie\", 幸福饼干 xìngfú bǐnggān \"good luck biscuit\", or 占卜饼 zhānbǔ bǐng \"divining cookie\". As far back as the 19th century, a cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie was made in Kyoto, Japan, and there is a Japanese temple tradition of random fortunes, called omikuji. The Japanese version of the cookie differs in several ways: they are a little bit larger; are made of darker dough; and their batter contains sesame and miso rather than vanilla and butter. They contain a fortune; however, the small slip of paper was wedged into the bend of the cookie rather than placed inside the hollow portion. This kind of cookie is called tsujiura senbei (辻占煎餅) and is still sold in some regions of Japan, especially in Kanazawa, Ishikawa.[2] It is also sold in the neighborhood of Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine in Kyoto.[3] Makoto Hagiwara of Golden Gate Park's Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco is reported to have been the first person in the U.S. to have served the modern version of the cookie when he did so at the tea garden in the 1890s or early 1900s. The fortune cookies were made by a San Francisco bakery, Benkyodo.[4][5][6] David Jung, founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company in Los Angeles, has made a competing claim that he invented the cookie in 1918.[7] San Francisco's Court of Historical Review attempted to settle the dispute in 1983. During the proceedings, a fortune cookie was introduced as a piece of evidence with a message reading, \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. Not Very Smart Cookie\". A federal judge of the Court of Historical Review, from San Francisco themselves, determined that the cookie originated with Hagiwara and the court ruled in favor of San Francisco. Subsequently, the city of Los Angeles condemned the decision.[7] Seiichi Kito, the founder of Fugetsu-do of Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, also claims to have invented the cookie. Kito claims to have gotten the idea of putting a message in a cookie from Omikuji (fortune slip) which are sold at temples and shrines in Japan. According to his story, he sold his cookies to Chinese restaurants where they were greeted with much enthusiasm in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas, before spreading.[8] Up to around World War II, fortune cookies were known as \"fortune tea cakes\"—likely reflecting their origins in Japanese tea cakes.[2] Fortune cookies moved from being a confection dominated by Japanese-Americans to one dominated by Chinese-Americans sometime around World War II. One theory for why this occurred is because of the Japanese American internment during World War II, which forcibly put over 100,000 Japanese-Americans in internment camps, including those who had produced fortune cookies. This gave an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers.[2] Fortune cookies before the early 20th century were all made by hand. The fortune cookie industry changed dramatically after the fortune cookie machine was invented by Edward Louie in the late 1960s.[9] The machine allowed for mass production of fortune cookies which subsequently allowed the cookies to drop in price to become the novelty and courtesy dessert many Americans are familiar with after their meals at most Chinese restaurants today. There are approximately 3 billion fortune cookies made each year globally, the majority of them consumed in the US.[2] The largest manufacturer of the cookies is Wonton Food, Inc., headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. They make over 4.5 million fortune cookies per day. Other large manufacturers are Baily International in the Midwest and Peking Noodle in Los Angeles. There are other smaller, local manufacturers including Tsue Chong Co. in Seattle, Keefer Court Food in Minneapolis, Sunrise Fortune Cookie in Philadelphia, and Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory in San Francisco. Many smaller companies will also sell custom fortunes. Manufacturing processes vary, but they generally follow the same procedure. The ingredients (typically made with a base of flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil) are mixed in a large tank and squirted onto fast moving trays. These function like a conveyor belt and are heated to cook the dough. Cookies are compressed with round hot plates to shape and cook them. The cookies bake for approximately one minute and are reshaped. They can be mechanically shaped or folded by hand. When automated, a machine folds the cookie into the correct orientation with the fortune inside. Cooled and hardened cookies are sealed in plastic wrappers, which are inspected before being shipped. Today, most cookies are produced in the United States with the biggest factory located in Brooklyn.[10] The message inside may include a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers; since relatively few distinct messages are printed, in the recorded case where winning numbers happened to be printed, the lottery had an unexpectedly high number of winners sharing a prize.[11] Authorities briefly investigated Wonton Food in 2005, after 110 Powerball lottery players won about $19 million after using the \"lucky numbers\" on the back of fortunes.[12][13] Fortune cookies are sometimes used for special marketing promotions. For example, the film Kung Fu Panda 3 was promoted by putting quotations from the protagonist of the film on fortune cookie slips.[14] In 1989, fortune cookies were reportedly imported into Hong Kong and sold as \"genuine American fortune cookies\".[15] Wonton Food attempted to expand its fortune cookie business into China in 1992, but gave up after fortune cookies were considered \"too American\".[15] Cookies from different manufacturers have different ingredients and nutritional content. One cookie typically contains around 80 to 130 kilojoules (20 to 30 kilocalories) of food energy and 5–7 g of total carbohydrates. A cookie may have sugar varying from 0–3 g, between 2–8 mg of sodium, and may have significant (compared to their size) amounts of iron or protein. The small size means they have little overall nutritional value.[16][17][18][19] Fortune cookies, while largely an American item, have been served in Chinese restaurants in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates as well as other countries.[2] In Peru, they are served in the chifas, Chinese-Peruvian fusion food restaurants.[20] There are also multi-cultural versions of the fortune cookie. For instance, the Mexican version of the fortune cookie, called the \"Lucky Taco\", is a red taco-shaped cookie with a fortune inside.[21] The same company that makes the Lucky Taco also makes a \"Lucky Cannoli\", inspired by Italian cannolis.[21]", "Fortune cookies are a beloved treat that many people associate with Chinese American restaurants. These small, crispy cookies are often served at the end of a meal and contain a slip of paper with a “fortune” inside. But there’s more to them than meets the eye. From their surprising origin to the unique recipe, fortune cookies have a rich and fascinating history worth exploring. Fortune cookies are a staple of Chinese American cuisine, but it’s believed that they actually originated in Japan. A Japanese cracker called tsujiura senbei can be traced back to 19th-century Kyoto. This cracker was made with sesame and miso, and contained a small paper fortune tucked into its folds. These crackers arrived in the U.S. with the Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii and California after the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, which created a demand for cheap labor to replace the Chinese immigrants who were forced out. A lot of the Japanese immigrants who moved to the U.S. settled in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The fortune cookie recipe from Kyoto came with them, and the treats started to pop up in bakeries in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the early 1900s. The Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park is often credited as the first place in the country to sell the modern-day fortune cookie. The food’s exact origins are still a subject of debate, with multiple sources claiming to have invented the cookie around the same time, including three businesses in Los Angeles: the Fugetsu-Do confectionary shop, Japanese snack manufacturer Umeya, and the Hong Kong Noodle Company. Fortune cookies have always had a relatively simple recipe. While the original Japanese crackers were savory and contained sesame oil and miso, most cookies you’ll find today are made with sugar, flour, vegetable shortening, water, vanilla, and food coloring. After the batter has been mixed, it’s used to form flat, thin circles on a hot baking tray. The cookies only need to bake for a few minutes before they’re fully cooked and ready to be shaped. After baking, the fortune cookies are removed from the oven and immediately folded into the traditional curved shape while they’re still hot and pliable; this is also when paper fortunes are slipped inside. The process must be completed quickly, as it doesn’t take long for the desserts to harden. The folded cookies are then cooled before being packaged and shipped to restaurants and retailers. Today, most fortune cookies are made by machine, but some artisanal bakers still whip them up by hand. There are also different variations in the recipe: Though some fortune cookies come in different colors and flavors, they’ll all typically have a subtle hint of vanilla. It’s difficult to estimate the exact number of fortune cookies made annually, as they’re produced by many different manufacturers and small-scale bakers. However, it’s safe to say that fortune cookies are a popular treat. Some estimates claim that around 3 billion fortune cookies are produced every year—according to the Museum of Food and Drink, one Brooklyn-based factory alone makes 4.5 million each day. Though the U.S. leads the world in fortune cookie production and consumption, the crunchy confections are served in Chinese restaurants elsewhere in the world as well. Wonton Food Inc., based in Brooklyn, is the largest manufacturer of fortune cookies in the world. The company was founded in 1973 by Ching Sun Wong, who immigrated from China to the U.S. in the 1960s. He started the company in a store’s basement. Now, Wonton Food Inc.’s various plants produce a wide variety of the treats, including the traditional vanilla ones as well as flavored cookies like chocolate and citrus. Wonton Food Inc. has about 15,000 fortunes in a database it uses for all its cookies. Donald Lau, former vice president and chief financial officer Wonton Food, wrote most of those fortunes as part of his job when he first started with the company. He would find inspiration throughout the day in everything from the newspaper to subway signs. Lau eventually stopped writing new fortunes after he developed writer’s block. Yang’s Fortunes, Inc., a fortune cookie company based in San Francisco, has a database of about 5000 fortunes it uses in their cookies. After Lau decided to stop writing fortunes regularly, Wonton Food Inc. began hiring freelance writers every couple of years to create new fortunes. Other companies that produce fortune cookies also hire writers to generate new ideas. These gigs aren’t advertised regularly—so keep an eye out if you’d like to add this job to your portfolio. Fortune cookie writers are typically hired as freelancers and don’t get paid a lot, but it would be pretty fun to come across one of your own fortunes one day. © 2023 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved", "Sections That crunchy confection whose unobtrusive vanilla flavor is always a welcome complement to a heavy, savory meal Jesse Rhodes Last Friday a friend and I decided to grab dinner at a Chinese restaurant down by the D.C. waterfront. We indulged in the hot and sour soup and plates of steak sauteed with scallions and red onion and dark chicken meat marinated in garlicky soy sauce and served with a medley of nuts. And when all that was left on the white stoneware serving plates was a stray cashew or two, the waiter kindly offered us a dessert menu. Tempted, though having had my fill, I was quite content to settle for the dessert that customarily comes with the check. The fortune cookie—that crunchy confection whose unobtrusive vanilla flavor is always a welcome complement to a heavy, savory meal. It's also the only time I appreciate my food talking back to me. My little strip of paper offered the chipper observation: \"You are well liked and valued by those around you.\" Who am I to argue with what a cookie tells me? Argument has, however, arisen when it comes to determining this cookie's actual national origin. It's a quintessential element of the Chinese food experience here in America, yet both Chinese and Japanese immigrant populations in this country have claimed the confection as theirs. The issue became so contentious that it fueled a 1983 court battle wherein the judge gave a split decision ruling that the modern fortune cookie was born in pre-World War I San Fransisco; however, he declined to decide which nationality had claim to the treats. The fortune cookie and its murky history is a recurring element in Jennifer 8. Lee's The Fortune Cookie Chronicles, an in-depth exploration of Chinese food in the Western world wherein she traces the beginnings of Chinese dining hallmarks such as home delivery and General Tso's Chicken in addition to exploring darker subjects such as how the Chinese restaurant industry dovetails with the human trafficking industry. But divining whence fortune cookies came required a lot of detective work that ultimately brought her to Yasuko Nakamatchi, a Japanese researcher who was able to cleave through decades of folklore and hearsay-based creation stories. Fortune cookies are most likely of Japanese origin. In the course of her detective work, Nakamatchi came upon a handful of family-owned bakeries near a Shinto shrine in Kyoto who continued the local tradition of making tsujiura senbei (\"fortune crackers\"). Flavored with sesame and miso, the cookies are larger and browner than their American cousins, and the little paper fortunes are found on the outside, held in the cookie's little \"arms.\" The clincher was an 1878 Japanese block print of a man preparing senbei using the same hand-operated cookie grills still used in the Kyoto bakeries. (Of course, at least for the American market, the manufacturing process is automated.) Dessert was never a strong point in Chinese cooking. \"Traditional Chinese desserts, as any Chinese-American child will tell you, are pretty bad,\" Lee writes in her book. \"There is a reason Chinese cuisine has a worldwide reputation for wontons, and not for pastries.\" So how did the Chinese inherit Japan's fortune cookies in the United States? During World War II, Chinese food spiked in popularity and, at least on the West Coast, dinners were commonly accompanied by fortune cookies; however, when Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps, their bakeries that produced the cookies were shuttered. Chinese entrepreneurs stepped in to fill the void and by the end of the war they were indelibly associated with fortune cookies, whose popularity had spread nationwide. So, if you're ushering in the year of the rabbit tomorrow, there are more traditional, definitively Chinese foodstuffs you can include as a part of your celebration. Nevertheless, I think there's something to be said for the sheer fun of cracking into fortune cookies with a group of friends and each person reading aloud the random pearl of wisdom they received—perhaps adding a line of innuendo for a bit of innocent fun.

{"question": "Why do veins appear blue?", "answer": "Veins appear blue because blue light does not penetrate deeply into human tissue", "mgt": "Veins appear blue under the skin for a couple of reasons. First, the skin itself is not actually blue; it appears that way when you look at the network of blood vessels beneath it. Veins, especially when they are closer to the surface and filled with blood, contain a gas called oxygenated hemoglobin. This gas gives blood a reddish or brick-like appearance, but when light with a wavelength of around 450 nanometers — which is what our eyes are most sensitive to — scatters off the oxygenated portion of the blood in a way that is more dominant, it appears blue.\n\nHere's a scientific explanation of why this happens:\n\n1. **Structure:** Veins are larger and more cylindrical than arteries, which tend to be thinner and more muscular. This difference in structure makes the light from within the blood vessels more likely to bounce off the outer layers without being absorbed.\n\n2. **Blood content:** Veins generally carry deoxygenated blood from the body's tissues back to the heart. Deoxygenated blood has more red blood cells packed with hemoglobin, which is a protein that binds to oxygen. This higher concentration of hemoglobin in the blood gives it a reddish hue.\n\n3. **Refraction:** When light enters the skin and hits the blood, it bounces (refracts) as it passes through the tissue. Blood in the vessels acts as a transparent medium at this wavelength, but because it's filled with the reddish red color from the oxygenated hemoglobin, the light gets mostly scattered in the blue-violet end of the spectrum.\n\n4. **Scattering:** The shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) scatter more than the longer wavelengths (red and orange) when they encounter the opacity of the blood. This process is more pronounced in the blue range, making the veins appear blue.\n\n5. **Distance from the surface:** The deeper the blood vessel, the further light has to travel through the skin to reach your eyes. The skin's thickness absorbs more light, further exaggerating the blue appearance.\n\nSo, to sum up, the blue appearance of veins is a result of the way that light bounces off the oxygenated blood in them, the structure and color of the tissue they're in, and the scattering and absorption of light during the process.", "token_usage": 467, "human_written_evidences": ["Veins appear blue due to how blue and red light penetrate human tissue; Veins appear blue because blue light has a shorter wavelength than red light; Veins appear blue because blue light does not penetrate deeply into human tissue; Veins appear blue because blue light is scattered or reflected before reaching the vein; People think that veins appear blue because deoxygenated blood is blue, but it's actually due to how blue and red light penetrate human tissue"], "reference_documents": [], "model_retrieved_documents": ["It's not because deoxygenated blood is blue. Dr Claire Asher Your bloodgets its colouration from red blood cells, which contain haemoglobin – iron-rich molecules that are bright red when carrying oxygen and a darker, duller red when deoxygenated. So why, when you look at the veins in your arm, do they appear to be blue? The answer lies in the fact that different colours of light have different wavelengths, so they are absorbed and reflected differently when they hit our skin. Red light has a very long wavelength, so it can travel through the skin relatively easily and is absorbed by the haemoglobin in the blood. Blue light, on the other hand, has a much shorter wavelength and so it is mostly reflected by the skin. If you shine white light – a mixture of all the different wavelengths – onto your arm, where veins are present, the red light will be absorbed and the blue light will be reflected. This means that the light returning to your eyes will contain more blue than red wavelengths, making the veins look blue compared to the surrounding skin. Medics sometimes make use of this phenomenon by shining a red or infrared light on the skin to help them locate a vein to administer an injection. Similarly, nightclubs sometimes use blue lights in the toilets to discourage intravenous drug use, by making it hard to see veins through the skin.

Red light penetrates deeper into the skin and is absorbed by the vein. The blue and green wavelengths of light are scattered back. It is a myth that blood is blue in the veins and red in the arteries. In medical diagrams, veins are blue, not because that is the color of human blood, but instead just to differentiate veins from arteries. In the veins, the blood is just a slightly darker red compared to the brighter red blood in the arteries. But, if blood is red, why do the veins that are visible through the skin appear blue (or purple or green)? Shouldn’t that appear red too? Recommended Video for you:Rainbow Colors: Why Don't You See All Colors In The Rainbow? Recommended Video for you: The clue is in the question above. The veins only appear blue; that is, they only look blue to our eye because of how the skin and veins absorb, reflect and scatter light. If you ever get the opportunity to look at a vein or artery on its own, you’ll see that both the blood vessels are white. Even nerves are white. And in fact, most tissues are, unless they have a pigment or something that absorbs a certain wavelength of light and reflects every other wavelength. White light is made up of different wavelengths of light that line up with the color spectrum of the rainbow. Color of an object depends on which wavelengths the object absorbs and which it reflects. Skin, and biological tissues in general, are complex. Skin has several layers with different types of tissues and cells. There are skin cells and fat cells and hair follicles and melanin and collagen fibers, of course, blood vessels. When white light hits skin, the wide spectrum of wavelengths and their colors interact uniquely. Across the spectrum, red light (700 nm) penetrates through the skin the most while blue (450 nm) does so the least. Because blue light penetrates the skin the least, it is also the first to get scattered by the molecular stuff in skin. In areas where there is a vein, the red light will reach the veins. Veins contain mainly deoxygenated blood, while arteries carry oxygenated blood. Deoxygenated blood absorbs red light (while oxygenated blood reflects red light, which is why blood from the arteries or capillaries will look appear more bright red than the blood in the veins which will look maroon). When you combine the two events you get blue looking veins. The skin scatters of blue and green light, and because the veins absorb red light, only the blue and green wavelengths reach the eye. If you want to see the play of the light yourself, there is a little experiment you can do. Get a hold or a red light and a blue light. Or find red and blue celophane paper to cover a flashlight with. Flash the lights on back of your hand or the inside of your arm. With the red light you should see your veins become more prominent. With the blue light, you should see only blue colored skin, no veins. Doctors and nightclubs use this to their advantage. Nurses and doctors can use a vein finder that shines red (700nm) or infrared light (760 to 1 million nm) to detect veins for injections, IV drips, and draw blood. Caption: A vein finder Nightclubs toilets do the opposite in that they may use blue light to deter intravenous drug use by making the veins more difficult to locate. Blue light in a bathroom to limit intravenous drug use. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) Also Read: If Blood Is Red, Why Do Veins Look Blue? Most arteries are located deeper in the body. A few arteries do come close to the surface of the body, such as the radial arteries that pass through the wrist and are used to count pulse. But you still don’t see them. There are three reasons for this. First, the arteries are still located much deeper than the most superficial veins. Second, arteries have much thicker walls and so the light waves cannot interact with the blood. Third, arteries carry oxygenated blood which does not absorb red light as much as deoxygenated blood does. Some veins, though, are quite superficially located. All that means is that they’re closer to the skin. These are the ones you can see, and the ones that cause varicose veins. There are two other types of veins that you cannot see: deep veins located, as the name suggests, deep within the body, and pulmonary veins that come out from the lungs. You can see your capillaries and those do no appear green or blue. That is because the capillaries are thin, thinner than hair. They are much closer to the skin than the veins, and appear reddish pink because of the bright red blood flowing through them. Also Read: Why Is The Sky Blue? Ever wondered why royalty is called blue blood? One telling of this phrase is that European royalty were so cloistered in their dark castles that they never had to labor in the sun, which made their veins appear stark blue underneath the fair, translucent, untanned skin. There is scientific truth in that story. Depending on your skin color, how tanned you are, and whether you have translucent skin, the color your veins appear will be slightly different. The deeper the vein, the more green it will appear while the more superficial the vein, the more blue, or even purple it will appear because of how the light scatters. We see this with bruises too. A more superficial bruise look purple. A deeper bruise looks green.

Since red and blue colors are of two different wavelengths, they penetrate the skin with different degrees of success. As a result of this, bluish-green light is reflected off the blood and reaches the observer’s eyes, making our veins appear blue. Many believe that veins appear blue simply because the blood they carry is blue, due to its deficiency in oxygen. It is often proposed that a higher concentration of carbon dioxide and a lack of oxygen give the venous blood a bluish-greenish tinge. However, technically, that is completely inaccurate. I remember back when I was in high school, when I was taught that the human heart dealt with two versions of blood: one that was rich in oxygen (oxygenated blood) and one that was devoid of it (deoxygenated blood). These two types of blood flowing throughout the body are usually represented through red and blue colors in diagrams. That’s probably the reason why lots of folks believe that the deoxygenated blood has a bluish tinge. However, that’s not the real reason. Recommended Video for you:Circulatory System And The Heart | Explained In Simple Words Recommended Video for you: You might already know that the heart is the central organ of our circulatory system. It is also one of the most critical organs of the body, located above the lungs and slightly to the left, and beats as long as a person lives. It’s also arguably the hardest-working organ in the body. The heart pumps oxygenated blood (i.e., blood that is rich in oxygen) throughout the body with the help of arteries (which transport it to thousands of tissues). Similarly, deoxygenated blood flows back to the heart, which then transports it to the lungs, pulling the waste carbon dioxide out of the blood and expelling it from the body along the way. Also Read: What Are Arteries, Veins And Capillaries? Contrary to what many people think, the blood in our veins, i.e., deoxygenated blood, is not blue. In fact, no kind of human blood is blue. If anything, deoxygenated blood is even redder than regular, oxygenated blood. If you have ever had your blood drawn and noticed its color, you would clearly know that deoxygenated blood is a dark red. So, it’s amply clear that venous blood is indeed red. Yet the veins we see in our arms, wrists, hands and other parts of the body seem to have a greenish, bluish tinge. Why is that? Human skin doesn’t absorb light of any wavelength, but blood absorbs the light of all wavelengths. However, it absorbs red light a little less than others. The thing with blue light is that it doesn’t penetrate the skin as well as red light does (Source). As a result, if a blood vessel is close to the surface of the skin, almost all blue light is absorbed by the skin (as blue doesn’t penetrate the skin), which makes the vessel appear red. However, if the vessel in question is located a little deeper (0.5 millimeter or more), not as much red or blue light will be absorbed. In this case, the ratio of blue light reflected to red light reflected would be around 2:3 (Source), and the vein would thus appear greenish-blue. Interestingly, such ‘deeper’ vessels appear blue despite reflecting more red light (than blue). This strange phenomenon is attributed to relative color perception, or, in other words, how we perceive colors relative to other colors present in the surroundings. Our vision is somewhat influenced by relative perception, so if a purple ball is placed adjacent to a red one, the purple ball will appear to have a bluish tinge. Similarly, some veins appear blue because the surrounding skin reflects more red light (than blue), thus making the veins look bluish. Furthermore, veins are larger, have thinner walls and are located closer to the skin surface than arteries, which is why we can actually see them (but not arteries). In a nutshell, veins being blue has nothing to do with the kind of blood (oxygenated/deoxygenated) that they carry; it’s entirely dependent on their location beneath the skin!

I often hear different points of view to this question - some say the hottest part of the chili is its seeds, yet I've heard some (arguably more believable) sources claim that the white part that holds the seeds to the flesh is the hottest. What part of the chili fruit is the hottest? The Wikipedia article on Capsicum reads, citing a FAQ on a page of the ollege of Agriculture and Home Economics of the New Mexico State University: Capsaicin is present in large quantities in the placental tissue (which holds the seeds), the internal membranes and, to a lesser extent, the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in the genus Capsicum. Contrary to popular belief, the seeds themselves do not produce any capsaicin, although the highest concentration of capsaicin can be found in the white pith around the seeds. Cisneros-Pineda et al. measured via gas chromatography the content of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin in the pericarp, placenta, and seeds of seven cultivars of chili peppers and the results confirm this: For dihydrocapsaicin, the difference is not so large, but the placenta still has a higher concentration. In terms of concentration considering fresh mass the difference won't be as dramatic because while the seeds lose around half their mass by drying, the placenta will lose 90%. Both the seeds & the membrane can pack heat. While I believe the experts who say \"it is the membrane\" my experience is that it is easier to control the heat by removing the seeds and the membrane and adding some seeds back in to get to your target \"heat level\" in any giving recipe. Exactly, ribs and placenta contain the hottest part. That's the point for hotness. In regards to seeds, I do not recomend to add seeds to any hot cooked or raw sauce, because seeds are not good for our digestion, in any pepper, hard to process them. Just think, do you add seeds when cooking a red sweet bell pepper? I love hotness but I always take the seeds out of my salsas, for health. I do not understand why chefs add seeds...

Humans have been using hot peppers in cooking for millennia. But have you ever wondered what makes peppers spicy? Here, you will learn all about what makes spicy peppers hot, and some helpful tips to reduce the pain (if you’re in need). The main cause of the heat in peppers is the chemical compound Capsaicin, which binds with pain receptors in our tissue, causing a burning sensation. It is found abundantly in many Capsicum cultivars. You may not have heard of capsaicin, but you have probably felt its effect. Capsaicin is a chemical compound that is naturally found in some peppers. When contact is made with human tissue, capsaicin causes a burning sensation. In other words, capsaicin is what makes peppers spicy. This is what capsaicin looks like to a scientist: In short, scientists originally thought capsaicin was in peppers to deter animals from eating them. However, more recent research indicates that the chemical is more likely produced to prevent insect damage and fungal growth within the peppers. Capsaicin binds with certain pain receptors, causing the familiar burning sensation, however it is not an actual burn. No damage is caused to the tissue, and instead it just feels painful. This reaction to capsaicin originally led scientists to believe that the pepper plant used it to deter animals from eating their fruits. This was odd, because most plants actually encourage animals to eat their fruits in order to spread seeds via mobile mammals. However, most stomach acid causes damage to pepper seeds, with the exception of birds. And birds can’t feel the burn from hot peppers. “Birds are indifferent to the pain-producing effects of capsaicin and therefore serve as vectors for seed dispersal.” So it all made sense; most animals destroy pepper seeds when they eat them, and they don’t like the pain of eating the peppers. Meanwhile, birds don’t destroy seeds, and they can’t feel the pain of capsaicin. It seemed like a symbiotic relationship between pepper plants and birds for spreading seeds and eating respectively. However, more recently, capsaicin was found to be helpful in preventing mold growth on peppers in humid climates. This is now accepted as the primary reason that peppers produce capsaicin. The relationship with birds is still likely beneficial to both parties. Check out this video explaining more interesting research on this topic. The highest concentration of capsaicin in peppers is within the placenta or “pith” portion of the flesh. This is the membrane that suspends the seeds inside of the pepper. As a result, removing the seeds is often recommended when cooking to reduce the spiciness of a dish. The placenta is also the portion of the pepper to avoid touching while cutting peppers. Capsaicin will cause irritation to any part of your body that it touches, so be careful of the hands, eyes and any other sensitive skin. If you find yourself with a hot pepper burn on your hands, try some of our remedies here. Pepper seeds are often said to be the spiciest part of a hot pepper. However this is technically not true. The most spicy portion of a pepper is the placenta, or pith, not the seeds themselves. The pepper seeds often have residual capsaicin on their surface due to contact with the placenta, but the actual seeds do not contain any capsaicin. It is still best practice to remove the seeds in order to reduce spiciness when cooking. If you remove the seeds, chances are you will also remove most of the placenta, as the seeds are connected. After eating a particularly spicy meal, you may begin to panic and wonder if you are in real danger. Can peppers actually burn your mouth and cause damage? In short, spicy peppers do not cause any actual tissue damage like a real burn would. The capsaicin molecule binds with pain receptors, imitating the sensation of a burn. Highly-sensitive individuals may want to avoid spicy food. It can cause an upset stomach and long-lasting discomfort. Did you eat a pepper that was way too hot? It’s pretty easy to find habanero peppers or even ghost peppers at the supermarket. But most are not ready for the intense pain that comes with eating these highly spicy peppers. Here are the 3 best methods for reducing spicy burning in the mouth and lips. Tip: Avoid getting pepper juices on your lips. This can be more painful and more difficult to cure than heat on the tongue. Did you cut some hot peppers without gloves? Feeling the burn hours later? This is a painful issue, but thankfully we’ve got 3 great methods for reducing pepper burn on the skin: Good to know: Capsaicin does not cause any damage to your tissue. However, without taking action, burning on the skin can last for several hours because there is not any natural flushing as there is in the mouth. Try one of our methods and you are sure to get some relief from pepper burns on the skin. Read more about stopping the burn here. While the initial sensation from contacting capsaicin is burning, the chemical compound is actually an analgesic. This means that capsaicin acts to relieve pain on a biological level. This is why many capsaicin creams and gels are now available for those suffering from various conditions. On a technical level, capsaicin is both a TRPV1 agonist, and a non-narcotic analgesic. Put more simply, capsaicin does act as a pain reliever (analgesic) at the chemical level. It is used to control peripheral nerve pain and is commonly used for people suffering from neuralgia. Ask your doctor before trying this method for pain relief. The Scoville Scale is the scale that is used to rank peppers in heat level. The scale is measured in “Scoville heat units” or SHUs for short. Peppers range from 0 to 2,000,000 SHUs and higher. Higher SHU ranking means a higher concentration of the chemical compound capsaicin. There are many other types of peppers all around the world, ranking all across the Scoville scale. If jalapenos are just not quite enough, but habaneros are too much, use the Scoville scale chart above to find one in the right zone. Want to try one of the world’s hottest peppers?

If no placenta is left. Copyright © 2023 Pepper Geek | Privacy Policy", "While everyone has been talking about the Carolina reaper, another contender has appeared for the spiciest chili in the world. Who is the world record holder? By Evan Williams The trend of people trying outrageously spicy food on the internet is on fire, especially now that the infamous Carolina reaper is being challenged by a new contender for spiciest chili in the world. Who owns this burning hot world record? When legendary spice man Chili Klaus and First We Feast's Sean Evans sat down to sample a Carolina reaper back in 2015, no one could have guessed the cultural impact that chilies would have over the coming years. Not only did Hot Ones make waves, but spicy food entered the zeitgeist with a bang, bringing many people into the world of curry, hot sauce, and spice. Yet, more than seven years later, the world-famous Carolina reaper has been usurped by an even spicier chili pepper. This demonic pepper is the new world record holder for spiciest chili! The spiciest chili in the world is a capsicum chili pepper known by most as \"Pepper X\". Cultivated by Ed Currie, the same guy who brought us the Carolina reaper, the pepper was created through the selective breeding of multiple hybrid chili plants with the express purpose of increasing the intensity of their spice. On October 16, 2023, Guinness World Records announced that Pepper X had dethroned the Carolina reaper, making it officially the spiciest pepper in the world. This also, within reasonable expectations, means that it is the spiciest food ever created and something that should be treated with serious caution. Part of the process of producing Pepper X was the creation of a capsicum pepper that, while small in overall size, has so many ridges and wrinkles that its interior is almost entirely made up of its placenta. The placenta of a chili is the bit that holds the seeds (not the seeds themselves), and is the hottest part. Talking to Wired about the process of creating a new type of pepper, Currie said that cultivation is a \"very time-consuming, very long process\" largely on account of the fact that \"if it doesn't work, then we've got to start all over again.\" Pepper X rates at a Scoville Heat Unit score of 2,693,000, making it significantly hotter than the previous world record holder, the Carolina reaper, which sat at 1,640,000 Scoville. As a result, it is without a doubt the spiciest pepper ever created. The key to a spicy chili is its level of capsaicin, a chemical found in most pepper plants that activate your heat and pain sensors. This is most noticeable when you put a pepper in your mouth, but also explains why your eyes, nose, and other sensitive spots will hurt when you touch them following contact with a chili. To maximize the power of a chili, a cultivator like Currie would have to develop a pepper that has as much capsaicin in any given area as possible. As the amount increases, the activation of pain receptors and the feeling of heat increases exponentially, causing all the usual symptoms that you would expect to experience when eating spicy food - just, in the case of Pepper X, significantly worse. You can tell from watching the Hot Ones video below that on account of Pepper X's extraordinary amount of placenta, which in turn contains a remarkable amount of capsaicin, it packs an extraordinary punch. With such a high concentration, it seems uncertain what you could cook with such a pepper, but it does certainly provide for some pretty entertaining YouTube content. Talking to First We Feast, Currie revealed his thought processes when developing such peppers: \"When we started the cross, there were two peppers that I really loved the flavor of, but neither of them were going to be hot enough for my tastes.\" Scoville units are the measurement of spiciness we use, and is entirely based on the concentration of capsaicin in a particular food or chili pepper. It would not be a good idea to do what Chili Klaus and Sean Evans seem to do on a daily basis. Spicy food can, when consumed in excess, cause quite unpleasant gut issues, rings of fire, painful bowel movements, and burning that can last for hours upon hours. In some cases, the consumption of extremely powerful chili has even caused medical issues. Settle down for something pleasant, season your food properly, and don't go so crazy with the spice. It's alright to bring-on the heat, but it's pointless if that heat isn't being used to bite through sourness, sweetness, or some other delicious flavor.

{"question": "How long should you wait before filing a missing person report?", "answer": "You can make a missing person report as soon as you think a person is missing", "mgt": "If a person goes missing and you're concerned for their safety, it's generally a good idea to report them to the police as soon as possible. The exact waiting time can vary depending on the circumstances, but here's what you should consider:\n\n1. **Immediate concern**: If someone has vanished under suspicious circumstances, such as a person with a history of mental health issues, a missing senior adult, or a child with special needs, report them immediately to the emergency services (911) in your area. This is because their well-being may be at immediate risk.\n\n2. **Time constraints**: If the person is missing voluntarily (e.g., they've wandered off and don't know where they are), call your local police department's non-emergency number to report them. They will assess the situation and provide guidance on whether to file a report and the time frame for doing so.\n\n3. **Private missing person**: For personal失踪, such as a friend or family member, you can usually file a report at your local police station. In the U.S., most departments have a 24-hour policy, but it's best to call as soon as you notice the person is missing to ensure prompt attention.\n\n4. **Unexplained absence**: If a person has been absent for an extended period (几天 or more) without explanation and you're worried, report it. However, if there's no immediate concern for their safety, the police may advise you to file a \"voluntary\" report and check in later.\n\n5. **Check-in**: After reporting the missing person, follow up with the police within a day or two to provide any updates. This is especially important if the case remains open.\n\nIn summary, the first priority is always the individual's safety. If you believe they're in immediate danger, call emergency services.

This is when search and rescue crews have the greatest chance of recovering the person alive. Filing a missing person report triggers a few critical events. The person is entered into NCIC (National Crime Information Center). NCIC is a database shared amongst law enforcement agencies. Once entered into NCIC, if an officer in any city or state comes into contact with the missing person and runs them through the system, they will be flagged as missing. If the missing person is deemed an “at risk” or “critical” missing (I will cover these designations in a different blog post), then a BOLO (Be On The Lookout) will be sent from the reporting agency to all nearby agencies with a thorough description of the missing person and the circumstances of their missing case.

Test the bull's aggression: By waving the cape, the matador checks how the bull reacts to the movement. If the bull charges or attempts to gore the cape, its behavior indicates its strength and the matador can gauge the level of difficulty in the upcoming part of the fight.\n\n3.

This is a crucial step in the bullfight, known as \"vaquilla,\" where the matador aims to establish control over the animal.\n\n4.

Bulls, along with all other cattle, are color-blind to red. Thus, the bull is likely irritated not by the muleta’s color, but by the cape’s movement as the matador whips it around. In support of this is the fact that a bull charges the matador’s other cape — the larger capote — with equal fury. Yet this cape is magenta on one side and gold or blue on the other. Related: What Really Happens to Fighting Bulls After the Fight? Still don’t believe it? In 2007, the Discovery Channel’s MythBusters tested a live bull on color versus movement in three separate experiments. First, they put three stationary flags, which were red, blue and white, in the bull’s enclosure. The bull charged all three flags regardless of color. Next, they put three dummies dressed in red, blue and white in the ring, and again the bull charged all three without discrimination (and actually charged the red dummy last). Finally, they put a live person dressed in red in the ring with the bull. That person stood still while two cowboys — not in red — moved around the ring. The bull went after the moving cowboys and left the motionless red-clad person alone. So, if a bull can’t see red, why is the muleta red?

The bullfighter always gets dressed in front of a mirror, and that’s where he begins to grow confident and to encourage himself, gathering the courage that he will need in the bullring. Through dressing, he can get as prepared as he can be. Bulls are irritated by the movement of the cape. They see the waving fabric and charge, regardless of color. In fact, the muleta is only used in the final 3rd of a bullfight The matador uses it to hide his sword, and he pierces the bull as it charges past. The cape is traditionally red to mask the bloodstains. Matadors became national heroes because of their courage and their ability to be in front of a bull. Most matadors came from a working-class background, and they came to symbolize the popular hero, especially at a time when working class people didn’t have a place in society. What do matadors wear under their pants? The traje de luces (‘suit of lights’) is the traditional clothing that Spanish bullfighters (toreros, picadores, and rejoneadores) wear in the bullring. The term originates from the sequins and reflective threads of gold or silver. Why do matadors wear pink socks? The electric pink socks, that supposedly indicate wealth as well as serve to rile the bulls up for a good fight.

Contrary to popular belief, bulls are not angered by the colour red. You’ve almost certainly heard the myth that bulls will go crazy at the sight of anything red. For quite a while, popular culture has included stories of unfortunate characters, unlucky enough to be wearing red clothes or carrying a red balloon, suddenly finding themselves the sole target of a bull’s aggression. But not only is this trope overdone, it’s completely incorrect. These clichés stem from matadors’ use of muletas (red capes) to taunt bulls into an ill-advised charge. However, the cape’s colour is not for the bull, it’s for the spectators. A red cape masks the blood of the bull during the finale of a bullfight when the matador finally puts down the bull and ends the fight. With a red cape, the spectacle looks a lot less violent and bloody than it really is, in the hopes that it will be more enjoyable for those watching. The cause of the bull’s anger is not the redness of the cape. That would actually be the cape’s motion. A cape of any colour could cause the bull to charge as long as the bullfighter waves it the same way. In fact, bulls are colour-blind. They only have 2 cones (colour receptors) in their eyes, whereas humans have 3. Bulls, like other ungulates (animals with hooves), have dichromatic vision. They have two different cone cells, those cells in the retina that detect color. One type of cone cell detect short wavelengths (S-cone) that is most sensitive at 444 to 445 nm (blue/violet region). The other type of cone cells perceive medium to long wavelengths at around 552-555 nm (yellowish-green). Since red light has a wavelength of around 650 nm, the bulls would only be able to see the capes in shades of grey. Rate This Biscuit Average rating / 5. Vote count: No ratings so far!

Site created and designed by", "Spanish-style bullfighting is a type of bullfighting that is practiced in Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, as well as in parts of southern France and Portugal. This style of bullfighting involves a physical contest with humans (and other animals) attempting to publicly subdue, immobilize, or kill a bull. The most common bull used is the Spanish Fighting Bull (Toro Bravo), a type of cattle native to the Iberian Peninsula. This style of bullfighting is seen to be both a sport and performance art. The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition – bulls are color blind. They attack moving objects; the brightly-colored cape is used to mask blood stains. In a traditional corrida, three toreros (or matadores) each \"fight\" against two out of a total of six \"fighting\" bulls to death, each bull being at least four years old and weighs up to about 600 kg (1,300 lb) (with a minimum weight limit of 460 kg (1,010 lb)). Bullfighting season in Spain runs from March to October. The practice is also known as a corrida de toros (\"bull-running\") or tauromaquia. Since the late-1980s, bullfighting in Spain has declined in popularity due to animal welfare concerns, its association with blood sport, and its links to nationalism. Most historians trace festivities involving bulls to prehistoric times, as a trend that once extended through the entire Mediterranean coast and has just survived in Iberia and part of France.[1] Early bullfights had a high mortality rate.[1] Alejandro Recio, a Spanish historian, considers the Neolithic city of Konya, Turkey, discovered by James Mellaart in 1958, as evidence of sacrificial tauromaquia associated with traditional rituals.[2] This claim is based on the abundance of representations of bulls, as well as on the preservation of horns and bullheads attached to walls.[1] Since then various archeological findings have proven the uninterrupted importance of the bull as a symbol of the sun for the Iberian cults, like the presence of berracos (known in Portuguese as berrão), or the importance of the bull in the surviving Celtiberian and Celtic rituals that continued into the 21st century.[1] These pre-Roman religions centered on the ritual sacrifice of sacred animals through direct or symbolic combat and was a likely motive for the depiction of bulls.[3] Bullrings are believed to originate their bullfighting tradition from Roman gladiator games.[4] During Roman Hispania gladiators were forced to fight animals by sword, such as bulls, bears, and wolves.[5] The Romans tried to abolish and ban the \"puere\" practice of bullfighting, considering it was too risky for the youth and not a proper way to worship the state deities.[5] According to Frommer's Travel Guide, bullfighting in Spain traces its origins to 711 CE, with the first official bullfight, or \"corrida de toros,\" being held in honor of the coronation of King Alfonso VIII. Once part of the Roman Empire, Spain owes its bullfighting tradition in part to gladiator games. At first, bullfighting was done on horseback and was reserved for Spanish aristocracy.[6] During the Arab rule of Iberia, the ruling class tried to ban the practice of bullfighting, considering it a pagan celebration and heresy.[7] Bullfighting was illegal in all Arab territory but became a mark of identity and resistance for Christian Iberians, especially for the nobility that started using it as a way to gain prestige. At first, bullfighting was done on horseback and was reserved for Spanish aristocracy; in contests the \"fighters\" were referred to as rejoneadores.[1] In the 16th century Pope Pius V banned bullfighting for its ties to paganism and for the danger it posed to the participants.[8] Anyone who would sponsor, watch or participate in a bullfight was to be excommunicated by the Church.[8] Spanish and Portuguese bullfighters kept the tradition alive covertly, and his successor, Pope Gregory XIII, took efforts to relax this penalty.[9] Pope Gregory advised bullfighters to not use the sport as way to honor Jesus Christ or the Saints, as was typical in Spain and Portugal.[8] King Philip V, the first King of Spain of Bourbon descent, ended bullfighting in the country because he believed it was in poor taste for nobles to practice such a bloody sport.[10] The change in bullfighting standards ran parallel to the discontent of the foreign rule of the Bourbons, and their lack of interest in understanding the politics, economics or culture of their new kingdom culminated in the Esquilache Riots of 1766.[11] New forms of bullfighting continued to develop as decrees against the activity proved largely ineffective.[11] After growing in popularity in Spain, King Carlos III attempted to ban bullfighting in 1771.[12] He attempted to reduce the social tension by building two of the eldest and largest bullfighting rings in Madrid as part of an offensive to fix the resentment some nobles and other powerful groups held towards the Crown's authority and actions.[12] King Charles IV attempted to formally ban the sport again after his predecessor made concessions.[12] King Joseph Bonaparte reversed this decision by hosting a bullfight during his coronation in 1808.[12] Joaquín Rodríguez Costillares (1743–1800) was a Spanish bullfighter from Seville who has been credited with founding modern Spanish-style bullfighting.[13][14] He established the \"cuadrillas tradition\" where teams of two or three banderilleros and two picadors taunt the bull.[15] He also organized the tercios de lidia (\"thirds of fight\") borrowed from the theatre; invented the Veronica and other basic cape movements as well as the current traje de luces (\"suit of light\"); and created the cape maneuvers (muleta), typical in this style of bullfighting since the 19th century.[16] Each matador has six assistants—two picadores (\"lancers\") mounted on horseback, three banderilleros (\"flagmen\"), and a mozo de espada (\"the lad of the swords\"). Collectively they compose a cuadrilla or team of bullfighters. The crew also includes an ayuda (aide to sword servant) and subalternos (subordinates) including at least two peones (pages, singular peón).[17][18] The modern Spanish-style bullfight (corrida, \"run\") is highly standardized, with three distinct parts (tercios, \"thirds\"), the start of each of which is announced by a trumpet sound.[19] The participants first enter the arena in a parade (paseíllo) to salute the presiding dignitary (presidente), usually accompanied by band music.[19] The corrida begins to the tune of live-played pasodobles, many of which were composed to honour famous toreros.[19] Torero costumes are influenced by 17th century Andalusian clothing.[20] Matadors are distinguished by a \"suit of lights\" (traje de luces), custom-made and embroidered with silver or golden thread.[21] The bull then enters the ring to be tested for aggressiveness by the matador and banderilleros with the magenta and gold capote (dress cape).[22] Bulls are raised on the open range by specialist breeding estates called ganadería. The bull enters the arena with a rosette on its back bearing the colours of the estate of its origin.[23] The first stage is called the tercio de varas (\"third of lances\").[24] The matador observes how the bull reacts to the waving of the banderilleros' cloak. They also note vision problems, unusual head movements, or if the bull favors a part of the ring called a querencia (territory).[22] A bull trying to reach its querencia is often more dangerous than a bull that is attacking the cape directly.[22] The initial attack by the matador is called the suerte de capote (\"act of the cape\"), and there are a number of fundamental \"lances\" (or passes) that matadors make; the most common being the verónica (named after Saint Veronica), which is the act of a matador letting their cloak trail over the bull's head as it runs past.[25] Then two picadores enter the arena each armed with a lance (vara), mounted on large heavily-padded and blindfolded horses.[26] The entrance of the horse attracts the bull to the picadores.[22] The picadores repeatedly drive their lances into the muscles (morrillo) of the bull's neck to weaken the animal.[27] As the picadores stab the bull's neck, the bull charges and attempts to lift the picador's horse.[28] If the picador is successful, the bull will hold its head and horns lower as a result of injury and weakness during the following stages of the fight.[29] This makes the bull less dangerous to enable the matador to perform the passes of modern bullfighting.[22] In a mandatory step in the corrida, regulations require that a plaza judge ensures a certain number of hits are made before it is considered completed. In the next stage – the tercio de banderillas (\"third of small flag\") – the matador attempts to plant two barbed or dart-like sticks known as banderillas (\"little flags\") onto the bull's shoulders.[30] These weaken the ridges of neck and shoulder muscle (which set fighting bulls apart from cattle) through loss of blood, while also spurring the bull into making more aggressive charges. By this point the bull has lost a significant amount of blood, exhausting the animal. The matador then enters with his cape and sword,[30] attempting to tire the bull further with several runs at the cape.[citation needed] The matadors place the banderillas around the bull. If the presidente decides that the bull is relatively weak or unwilling to fight, they may order the use of black banderillas, considered to be a poor reflection on the breeder.[31] In the third and final stage – the tercio de muerte (\"third of death\") – the matador re-enters the ring alone with a small red cape or muleta in one hand and a sword (estoc) in the other.[22] This cape is stretched with a wooden dowel and, in right-handed passes, the sword as well.[22] Having dedicated the bull to an individual or the whole audience, the matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a series of passes, demonstrating their control over it.[22] The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition – bulls are color blind. The movement of the cape is what irritates bulls; the colour by itself has the purpose of masking blood stains.[32] The faena is the entire performance combined with the muleta, which is usually broken down into a series of tandas (episodes). A typical tanda consists of three to five basic passes and then the finishing touch (remate), such as a pase de pecho, or pase de desprecio. Well-received passes are celebrated by the audience with shouts of \"¡ole!\". The faena ends with a final series of passes in which the matador with a muleta attempts to manoeuvre the bull into a position to stab it between the shoulder blades and through the aorta or heart. The entire part of the bullfight with the muleta is called the tercio de muerte (\"third of death\") or suerte de muleta (\"act of muleta\").[33][34] The act of thrusting the sword (estoca or estoque) is called an estocada.[22] A clumsy estocada that fails to give a \"quick and clean death\" will often raise loud protests from the crowd and may ruin the whole performance. If estocada is not successful, the matador must then perform a descabello and cut the bull's spinal cord with a second sword called verdugo, to kill it instantly and spare the animal pain.[22] Although the matador's final blow is usually fatal, it may take the bull some time to die. A coup de grâce is therefore administered by a peón named a puntillero, using a dagger to further pierce the spinal cord. The matador must kill the bull in 15 minutes after the first muleta pass, at most. After 10 minutes, if the bull is still alive, the presidente will order an aviso, a warning given with a trumpet sound. If a further three minutes elapse, a second aviso will be given; a third and final aviso is given after a further two minutes. The presidente will then give an order to have the bull returned to its pen (corral), or, if local law so requires, to have the bull killed outside the ring. It is a dishonor for the failing matador.[citation needed] The bull's body is dragged out by a team of mules. If the presidente is impressed by the performance of the bull, he orders a tour around the ring to honour the animal. Very rarely, a bull will be allowed to survive a fight as an indulgence granted in recognition of an exceptional performance. The spectators will demand an indulto from the presidente, by waving handkerchiefs before the estocada. The matador will stop and look at the presidente. If he stands still, he will resume their action and kill the bull. But if he has an orange handkerchief hung on his balcony, the matador will imitate the estocada with a banderilla or with the palm of his hand and the bull will be \"freed\". Such bulls are generally retired from competition and raised as studs, as their experience in the ring makes them extremely dangerous opponents. A fighting bull is never used in the ring twice, because they learn from experience, and the entire strategy of the matador is based on the assumption that the bull has not learned from previous experience. This also invalidates bulls who have been run in their estate by illegal fighters (maletillas), who in earlier times would sneak into an estate by night to practice their skills. A trofeo (trophy) is the usual indicator of a successful faena. When the records of bullfights are kept, trofeos earned by the matador are always mentioned. If the crowd demands, the matador is allowed to take a lap of victory around the ring. If at least half of the spectators petition the presidente by waving handkerchiefs, the presidente is obliged to award the matador with one ear of the bull. To award the matador with another ear or with two ears and the tail (los máximos trofeos), depends solely on the presidente's appreciation. A matador who won at least two ears is given the permission to be carried on the shoulders of the admirers (salida en hombros). In some cities, such as Seville, three matadors take on two bulls each, and salida en hombros is only available to a matador that wins a total of three trofeos between his two bulls. In general, a matador that faces a bull that is freed is usually awarded los máximos trofeos, although only symbolically; ears or the tail can only be physically cut off of a dead bull.[citation needed] Bullfighting is normally fatal for the bull, and it is dangerous for the matador. Picadors and banderilleros are sometimes gored, but this is not common. The suertes with the capote are risky, but it is the faena, in particular the estocada, that is the most dangerous. A matador of classical (Manolete) style is trained to divert the bull with the muleta but to come close to the right horn as he makes the fatal sword-thrust between the scapulae and through the aorta. At this moment, the danger to the matador is the greatest. Most matadors have been gored many times. A special type of surgeon has developed, in Spain and elsewhere, to treat cornadas, or horn-wounds. The bullring normally has an infirmary with an operating room, reserved for the immediate treatment of matadors with cornadas. The bullring has a chapel where a matador can pray before the corrida and where a priest can be found in case an emergency sacrament of extreme unction (also known as Anointing of the Sick or Last Rites) is needed. A poll conducted in 2014–2015 by the Spanish Ministry of Culture places bullfighting 10th in the list of most popular paid leisure activities. In 2015 9.5% of Spaniards went to a paid bullfight.[35] By Autonomous Communities, Navarre headed the list, followed by Castile-Leon, Aragon, La Rioja, Castile-La Mancha and Extremadura. The regions least interested in bullfighting were Galicia, the Canary Islands, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.[35] According to the poll, during the 2014–15 period 9.5% of the potential audience (Spaniards aged 15 and higher) would have attended a corrida at least once; this amounts to over 3.5 million people.[35] The history of female bullfighters participating in Spanish-style bullfighting has been traced to the sport's earliest renditions, namely during the late-1700s and early 1800s. Francisco Goya, an 18th-century Spanish painter, first depicted a female bullfighter in his work La Pajuelera, which featured a woman sparring with a bull on horseback.[36] The Spanish government banned women from participating in the sport from 1909 to 1934, following the Second Spanish Republic's liberation of women until 1939.[36] On 10 August 1974, under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, women were once again allowed to bullfight.[36] María de los Ángeles Hernández Gómez was the first woman to earn her bullfighting license (torera) after the ban was lifted.[36] During the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, women were forced to exile in other Spanish-speaking countries and the United States in order to continue bullfighting.[36] Throughout the 1980s women had difficulty completing their alternativa, a ceremony where a bullfighter becomes a matador, due to the social pressures of the decade.[37] Activism against bullfighting has existed in Spain since the beginning of the early 20th century, when a group of intellectuals, belonging to the Generation of '98, rallied against the popularity of bullfighting and other social issues, dismissing them as \"non-European\" elements of Spanish culture, which were to blame for the country's social and economic backwardness.[38][39] In the 21st century, bullfighting has come under increasing attack from animal rights activists and political actors for its links to Spanish nationalism.[40] Separatist and nationalist sentiment in Catalonia has played a key role in the region-wide ban of a practice which is strongly associated to Spanish national identity. However the bous al carrer runnings of the bulls are not banned. Galician and Basque nationalists have also expressed abolitionist stances, although in the case of the latter this has been somewhat mooted by the conundrum of bullfighting being at the heart of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona. Animal welfare concerns are perhaps the prime driver of opposition to bullfighting outside Spain, although rejection of traditionalism and Criollo elitism may also play a role in Latin America. In the Canary Islands, bullfights are banned but cock fights, banned in the rest of Spain, are popular. Animal rights activists claim bullfighting is a cruel or barbarous blood sport, in which the bull suffers severe stress and a slow, torturous death.[41][42][43] A number of animal rights or animal welfare activist groups such as Antitauromaquia (\"Antibullfighting\")[44] and StopOurShame[45] undertake anti-bullfighting actions in Spain and other countries. Other arguments in favor of bullfighting include those to the effect that the death of animals in slaughterhouses is often much worse than the death in the ring, and that both types of animal die for entertainment since humans do not need to consume meat, eating it instead for taste (bulls enter the food chain after the bullfight).[46] The last common defense to the practice is the conservationist standpoint for both the tradition itself and the Bravo bull variety, as Bravo bulls are the closest living relative to the European wild bull, completely extinct now and divided into sub-breeds whose only use is provision of meat and milk, serving the food industry. After years of increased pressure against bullfighting by abolitionist movements within Spain, the death of bullfighter Victor Barrio in July 2016 led to hundreds of comments being posted on various social media expressing joy towards the event and openly mocking his family and widow. This led to a significant backlash within Spain against anti-bullfighting activism,[citation needed] and criminal investigations are ongoing against those involved. Within a few days of Barrio's death, over 200,000 signatures had been collected demanding action be taken against one such activist.[47] Tercio de varas: Suerte de capote.

If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process. Medical News Today only shows you brands and products that we stand behind. The brain is the most complex organ in the human body. Many believe that a person only ever uses 10 percent of their brain. However, research suggests people use most of their brain. A person’s brain determines how they experience the world around them. The brain weighs about 3 pounds and contains around 100 billion neurons — cells that carry information. In this article, we explore how much of the brain a person uses. We also bust some widely held myths and reveal some interesting facts about the brain. According to a survey from 2013, around 65 percent of Americans believe that we only use 10 percent of our brain. But this is just a myth, according to an interview with neurologist Barry Gordon in Scientific American. He explained that the majority of the brain is almost always active. The 10 percent myth was also debunked in a study published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. One common brain imaging technique, called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), can measure activity in the brain while a person is performing different tasks. Using this and similar methods, researchers show that most of our brain is in use most of the time, even when a person is performing a very simple action. A lot of the brain is even active when a person is resting or sleeping. The percentage of the brain in use at any given time varies from person to person. It also depends on what a person is doing or thinking about. It’s not clear how this myth began, but there are several possible sources. In an article published in a 1907 edition of the journal Science, psychologist and author William James argued that humans only use part of their mental resources. However, he did not specify a percentage. The figure was referenced in Dale Carnegie’s 1936 book How to Win Friends and Influence People. The myth was described as something the author’s college professor used to say. There is also a belief among scientists that neurons make up around 10 percent of the brain’s cells. This may have contributed to the 10 percent myth. The myth has been repeated in articles, TV programs, and films, which helps to explain why it is so widely believed. Like any other organ, the brain is affected by a person’s lifestyle, diet, and the amount that they exercise. To improve the health and function of the brain, a person can do the following things. Eating well improves overall health and well-being. It also reduces the risk of developing health issues that may lead to dementia, including: The following foods promote brain health: There is a selection of walnuts and pecans available for purchase online. Regular exercise also reduces the risk of health problems that may lead to dementia. Cardiovascular activities, such as walking briskly for 30 minutes a day, can be enough to reduce the risk of brain function declining. Other accessible and inexpensive options include: The more a person uses their brain, the better their mental functions become. For this reason, brain training exercises are a good way to maintain overall brain health. A recent study conducted over 10 years found that people who used brain training exercises reduced the risk of dementia by 29 percent. The most effective training focused on increasing the brain’s speed and ability to process complex information quickly. There are a number of other popular myths about the brain. These are discussed and dispelled below. Many believe that a person is either left-brained or right-brained, with right-brained people being more creative, and left-brained people more logical. However, research suggests that this is a myth — people are not dominated by one brain hemisphere or the other. A healthy person is constantly using both hemispheres. It is true that the hemispheres have different tasks. For instance, a study in PLOS Biology discussed the extent to which the left hemisphere is involved in processing language, and the right in processing emotions. Long-term alcoholism can lead to a number of health problems, including brain damage. It is not, however, as simple as saying that drinking alcohol kills brain cells — this is a myth. The reasons for this are complicated. If a woman drinks too much alcohol while pregnant, it can affect the brain development of the fetus, and even cause fetal alcohol syndrome. The brains of babies with this condition may be smaller and often contain fewer brain cells. This may lead to difficulties with learning and behavior. Research suggests that subliminal messages can provoke an emotional response in people unaware that they had received emotional stimulus. But can subliminal messages help a person to learn new things? A study published in Nature Communications found that hearing recordings of vocabulary when sleeping could improve a person’s ability to remember the words. This was only the case in people who had already studied the vocabulary. Researchers noted that hearing information while asleep cannot help a person to learn new things. It may only improve recall of information learned earlier, while awake. The human brain is covered in folds, commonly known as wrinkles. The dip in each fold is called the sulcus, and the raised part is called the gyrus. Some people believe that a new wrinkle is formed every time a person learns something. This is not the case. The brain starts to develop wrinkles before a person is born, and this process continues throughout childhood. The brain is constantly making new connections and breaking old ones, even in adulthood. Now that we have dispelled some commonly held myths, here are some facts about the brain. Energy use The brain represents around 2 percent of a person’s weight but uses 20 percent of their oxygen and calories. Hydration First established in 1945, scientists estimate that the brain is around 73 percent water. Keeping the brain hydrated is important. Being dehydrated by as little as 2 percent may impair a person’s ability to perform tasks that involve attention, memory, and motor skills. Cholesterol Cholesterol is a type of fat that people often consider bad for their health. It’s true that eating too much cholesterol is bad for the heart. However, many people are unaware that cholesterol plays a significant role in a person’s brain. Without cholesterol, the cells in the brain would not survive. Around 25 percent of the body’s cholesterol is contained within the brain cells. Because of the organ’s complexity, scientists are still learning about the brain. The notion that a person uses only 10 percent of their brain is a myth. fMRI scans show that even simple activities require almost all of the brain to be active. While there is still a lot to learn about the brain, researchers continue to fill in the gaps between fact and fiction. Last medically reviewed on February 27, 2018 Share this article OUR BRANDS", "", "It’s one of Hollywood’s favorite bits of pseudoscience: human beings use only 10 percent of their brain, and awakening the remaining 90 percent—supposedly dormant—allows otherwise ordinary human beings to display extraordinary mental abilities. In Phenomenon (1996), John Travolta gains the ability to predict earthquakes and instantly learns foreign languages. Scarlett Johansson becomes a superpowered martial-arts master in Lucy (2014). And in Limitless (2011) Bradley Cooper writes a novel overnight. This ready-made blueprint for fantasy films is also a favorite among the general public. In a survey, 65 percent of respondents agreed with the statement, “People only use 10 percent of their brain on a daily basis.” But the truth is that we use all of our brain all of the time. How do we know? For one thing, if we needed only 10 percent of our brain, the majority of brain injuries would have no discernible consequences, since the damage would affect parts of the brain that weren’t doing anything to begin with. We also know that natural selection discourages the development of useless anatomical structures: early humans who devoted scarce physical resources to growing and maintaining huge amounts of excess brain tissue would have been outcompeted by those who spent those precious resources on things more necessary for survival and reproductive success. Tougher immune systems, stronger muscles, better looking hair—just about anything would be more useful than having a head full of inert tissue. We’ve been able to back up these logical conclusions with hard evidence. Imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), allow doctors and scientists to map brain activity in real time. The data clearly shows that large areas of the brain—far more than 10 percent—are used for all sorts of activity, from seemingly simple tasks like resting or looking at pictures to more complex ones like reading or doing math. Scientists have yet to find an area of the brain that doesn’t do anything. So how did we come to believe that 90 percent of our brain is useless? The myth is often incorrectly attributed to 19th-century psychologist William James, who proposed that most of our mental potential goes untapped. But he never specified a percentage. Albert Einstein—a magnet for misattribution of quotes—has also been held responsible. In reality, the concept most likely came from the American self-help industry. One of the earliest mentions appears in the preface to Dale Carnegie’s 1936 mega best seller, How to Win Friends and Influence People. The idea that we have harnessed only a fraction of our brain’s full potential has been a staple for motivational gurus, New Age hucksters, and uninspired screenwriters ever since. Obviously, this is bad news for anyone hoping to find the secret to becoming a genius overnight. The good news, though, is that hard work still works. There is plenty of reason to believe that you can build brainpower by regularly working at challenging mental tasks, such as playing a musical instrument, doing arithmetic, or reading a novel.", "Forbidden Details: cache-icn1450035-ICN 1700244125 2442632304 Varnish cache server"]}

In the story, the penny falls and kills a pedestrian on the sidewalk below. This is one of those classic urban legends that is untrue but contains a grain of truth. Advertisement Throwing a penny off the Empire State Building wouldn't kill someone. A penny only weighs about a gram and it tumbles as it falls. Even though this is one of the tallest buildings in the world because of the tumbling and the light weight, there's so much air resistance that the penny never really gathers that much speed before it hits its terminal velocity. A gram of weight traveling at a relatively slow speed might hurt a little if it hit you on the head, but it's not going to kill you. The grain of truth embedded in this urban legend is the fact that falling objects -- even ones that seem harmless -- can do a lot of damage. That's why people on construction sites wear hard hats. If a big nut or bolt weighing 50 grams (about 1.8 ounces) falls and hits you on the head, it's going to do some serious damage, and depending on the height it falls from, it could definitely kill you if it hit right on top of your skull. To get an idea of the damage it can do, let's take a look at a bullet. A bullet might weigh 5 to 10 grams, and it leaves the barrel of a gun at anywhere from 800 to 2,000 miles per hour, depending on the type of gun, the type of bullet and the amount of powder behind the bullet. A 44-caliber bullet weighs about 9 grams. Let's assume it leaves the gun at 1,000 miles per hour. That gives it a muzzle energy of about 300 foot-pounds (1 foot-pound is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 pound 1 foot in the air). Three-hundred foot-pounds of energy is clearly enough to kill someone. Even a third of that is enough to kill someone. A 1-gram penny falling from the Empire State Building might reach 100 miles per hour. It has a little less than 1 foot-pound of energy when it hits, and just hurts a little. If a 50-gram nut, or a roll of pennies weighing 50 grams, were to fall from the Empire State Building, it would fall about 1,000 feet. Ignoring air resistance, it would reach a velocity of about 250 miles per hour. That gives it energy of about 100 foot-pounds, which is fatal if it hits you on the head. If you're wearing a hard hat, however, you'll survive. Advertisement Please copy/paste the following text to properly cite this HowStuffWorks.com article: Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement", "The myth has persisted for years: dropping a penny from the top of the Empire State Building could kill someone below. But is there any truth to this notion? It's a question that merges urban legend with physics, legality, and public safety. In this article, we'll unpack the supposedly lethal penny's science, explore real-life experiments and studies, and discuss the legal and safety considerations of dropping any object from such heights. As we delve into this topic, we'll uncover what happens if someone drops a penny off the Empire State Building. The perception that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could be lethal is based on the idea that an object falling from such a height would accumulate extraordinary speed, making it deadly upon impact. However, this idea doesn't hold up when we consider the principles of physics, specifically the interplay between gravity, terminal velocity, and the specific characteristics of the penny itself. When any object is dropped from a height, it initially starts with a speed of zero, then accelerates downwards due to the force of gravity. Without air resistance, all objects, irrespective of their mass, would continue accelerating at around 9.8 m/s² until they hit the ground. However, our world is filled with air, which drastically changes the picture. The penny, as it falls, collides with air molecules. These collisions create a drag force that opposes the penny's downward motion. As the penny picks up speed, the drag force increases until it equals the force of gravity acting on the penny. At this point, the penny no longer accelerates and continues to fall at a constant speed called terminal velocity. The terminal velocity of an object depends on its shape and mass. For a small, flat object like a penny, the terminal velocity is quite low due to the relatively large surface area encountering air resistance compared to its weight. Estimates put the terminal velocity of a penny at around 50 miles per hour. Therefore, if you were to drop a penny from the Empire State Building (or any other height beyond which it could reach its terminal velocity), it would hit the ground at its terminal velocity, not at speed proportional to the height it was dropped from. At around 50 miles per hour, it might sting, but it wouldn't cause serious injury. Additionally, the design of skyscrapers often causes updrafts, which could cause the penny to be blown off course, potentially even causing it to end up higher than the starting point. In conclusion, dropping a penny from the Empire State Building is unlikely to cause damage due to its terminal velocity. However, it's still not advised because it can be a nuisance or distraction, which can be hazardous in a bustling city like New York. Contrary to popular urban legend, a penny falling from the Empire State Building or any other skyscraper won't kill a pedestrian on the ground. This myth has been propagated through various means, from casual conversations to being stated as fact in movies and television shows. In reality, physics doesn't support this claim. When an object falls through the atmosphere, two primary forces are acting on it: gravity, which pulls it downward, and air resistance, which opposes its downward motion. For a penny, its flat, thin, and lightweight characteristics contribute to a low terminal velocity — the highest speed it can achieve when falling. As mentioned, this terminal velocity is estimated to be around 50 miles per hour. A penny might sting if it hit you at this speed, but it would hardly be lethal. Several physicists and science TV shows like MythBusters have debunked this myth through calculations and practical experiments. Their findings demonstrate that even after falling from a great height like the Empire State Building, the penny would not have enough energy to inflict severe harm or cause death. However, it's important to note that while the penny itself isn't dangerous, dropping any object from a tall building can be. Even a harmless penny can startle or distract someone, potentially leading to hazardous situations in a busy city environment. In summary, while a penny dropped from the Empire State Building won't kill you, keeping all objects, no matter how small or seemingly harmless, from free-falling off tall structures is best. Not because of the potential physical harm they could inflict but due to the potential for distraction and surprise they could cause in the bustling city life below. Over the years, numerous individuals and organizations have tested the lethal penny myth in real-life scenarios to debunk it. Here are a few notable experiments and studies conducted: MythBusters: In one of their episodes, the MythBusters team recreated the scenario by dropping a penny from a height equivalent to that of the Empire State Building. Using a wind tunnel and a high-speed camera, they determined that a penny reaches its terminal velocity of about 50 miles per hour. When they fired a penny at this speed into a skull analog, it bounced off, debunking the myth that a penny dropped from a great height could kill a pedestrian. Scientific American: Similarly, Scientific American conducted a theoretical study. They, too, concluded that the terminal velocity of a penny falling edge-first (its most likely orientation while falling) is about 50 miles per hour and that the energy it carries wouldn't be sufficient to cause severe injury or death. Purdue University Study: Physicist Louis Bloomfield from the University of Virginia experimented and found that the maximum speed a penny could reach was 30 to 50 miles per hour - not nearly fast enough to kill or seriously injure anyone. Bloomfield further explained that the penny's shape and mass prevent it from becoming a deadly projectile. Each of these experiments concluded that contrary to popular belief, a penny dropped from the height of the Empire State Building is not deadly. While it's not advised (or legal) to throw objects from tall buildings due to potential unintended consequences, fears of lethal pennies can be laid to rest. So what would happen if someone dropped a penny from the top of the Empire State Building? Simply put, it would fall to the ground, but it wouldn't cause the catastrophic damage popular myth might have you believe. As we've established, a penny can only reach a terminal velocity of around 50 miles per hour due to its shape and mass. When it eventually hits the ground, or perhaps an unfortunate passerby, it wouldn't travel fast enough to cause serious harm. At most, getting hit by such a penny might feel like being flicked, not pleasant by any means, but far from deadly. Additionally, the urban environment surrounding the Empire State Building would influence the coin's descent. The wind could carry the penny off course, and the various skyscrapers could act as barriers. It's also worth noting that the Empire State Building observation decks are enclosed by tall fences specifically designed to prevent objects from being dropped. So, while it's an intriguing thought experiment, the reality is relatively mundane and much safer. The danger of a penny dropped from the Empire State Building is an enduring urban myth. A penny dropped from the Empire State Building can cause serious harm, so it's crucial to highlight the importance of safety and legality. Regardless of the physics involved, throwing objects off tall buildings is dangerous and illegal. While a penny may not have the capacity to kill, it could startle pedestrians, possibly causing accidents or triggering panic. Objects with more mass or aerodynamic shape can become lethal projectiles when dropped from significant heights. Legally, dropping objects from tall buildings like the Empire State Building is considered reckless endangerment and is punishable by law. The exact consequences can vary, but they may include hefty fines, imprisonment, or both. This rule isn't limited to just coins but applies to any objects that could harm individuals or property. Moreover, buildings like the Empire State Building have strict safety regulations, including protective barriers around observation decks to prevent such incidents.

It was a common piece of information that was spread across the playground. It is such a common urban legend that most of my other informants and I, too, have heard the same declaration. From when she was younger, her general understanding is that when dropped from the top balcony of the Empire State Building, the penny will gradually increase in velocity. As it gets closer to the ground, it will reach the speed of a bullet. If by chance the penny strikes a person in the head, the penny will go straight through and kill the person. She also says that there are variations of the legend: it will put a hole in the cement sidewalk, the coin will break to pieces, and even, that it has been used to purposefully kill someone. She laughed when she said the last variant saying: “I have no idea how or why someone would strategically plan to kill someone with a penny… on the top of the Empire State Building. You wouldn’t even be able to identify the right person from that high up! [laughs] …I don’t know, it was just something I heard from grade school.” My informant told me that she remembered this “fact” so well that when she actually went to New York when she was in high school, she asked one of the tour guides if it had ever happened: “The guide told me that he got that one a lot, but he reassured me that it wasn’t even possible. Supposedly, since the building is so tall, the updraft will slow the penny’s speed as it falls and won’t cause any damage. He also said, though, that people have thrown pennies off the side in the past, but they end up landing on other terraces on the lower floors.” After hearing this, I was curious and did a little more research. After checking a few different sources, it turns out the urban legend is in fact completely false. According to the book Empire State Building, a penny tossed from the top of the Empire State Building will never even hit the ground. The updraft effect pushes falling objects against the building and end up falling only a few stories below. The coins that are dropped from the 86th floor simply land on the 80th floor and are collected by electricians when they change the lights on the outer side of the building. Furthermore, according to an experiment that was performed for the ABC show “20/20,” even if the pennies dodge the 80th floor landing, the pennies are still harmless to pedestrians below. After sending a large weather balloon into the air with an attached penny dispenser, Louis Bloomberg – a University of Virginia physics professor – spit the pennies one by one through a remote control device. Several pennies hit Bloomberg but “it was like getting hit by a bug…it was noticeable, but nothing more…these things are just fluttering down.” Another experiment was performed on the show “Mythbusters” that tested the degree of impact at terminal velocity (the speed at which the penny would fall if no other factors such as friction acted upon the coin) on asphalt, cement, concrete and an anatomically correct human head replica. The experiment revealed that the penny would not penetrate any surfaces. As far as the human skull, a penny at terminal velocity may break the skin, but will not break through or fracture the skull. So as the crew of Mythbusters would say, this urban legend is “busted!” Hyneman, Jamie, and Adam Savage. “Mythbusters: Penny Drop MiniMyth.” Mythbusters. Discovery Channel, 2 Feb. 2011.

Hopefully, any worries one might have of being killed by a falling penny as they stroll by tall buildings in New York will be quelled. After all, people are usually not injured by hail falling from the clouds. We will apply Newton's laws of motion to two cases. At first we will neglect air resistance (drag) so we can solve the problem analytically. Then we will use a simple model of drag to show how the penny reaches a terminal velocity and how this dramatically affects the impact velocity of the penny on the ground. When the only force acting on a body as it falls toward another body, similar to an apple falling to the Earth, is gravity then we say the body is in free fall. The only way we can do this is if we neglet things like drag caused by the atmosphere, wind or variations in The Gravitational Field. This situation is depicted in Figure 1, where the force due to gravity is F = − m g {\\displaystyle F=-mg} \\includegraphics[scale=1]{FreeFallAcceleration.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 1:} Penny falling from Empire State Building The two things we want to calculate is the velocity of the penny when it impacts the ground and the time it takes the penny to fall. Applying Newton's second law to the penny F = m a {\\displaystyle F=ma} yields the acceleration of the penny in the y direction a ( t ) = F m = − m g m = − g . {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {F}{m}}=-{\\frac {mg}{m}}=-g\\,.} Notice that the minus sign comes from the coordinate system choice with the y axis pointing up. Next, integrate the acceleration equation to get the velocity of the penny at a given time. Remember that the acceleration is defined as a = d v d t . {\\displaystyle a={\\frac {dv}{dt}}.} This leads to the integration setup of ∫ d v = − ∫ g d t . {\\displaystyle \\int dv=-\\int gdt.} Integrate to get v ( t ) = − g t + C . {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt+C.} The constant is found using initial conditions, so at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0} , the velocity of the penny is zero v ( 0 ) = 0 = − g ( 0 ) + C . {\\displaystyle v(0)=0=-g(0)+C.} This is only true if C is also zero, therefore the velocity equation is v ( t ) = − g t {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt} Well, this is great, we can find the velocity at any given time. However, we do not know the time of the impact. For this we must integrate (1) to get the position of the penny. Remember, that velocity is defined as v = d x d t {\\displaystyle v={\\frac {dx}{dt}}} This leads to the integration setup of ∫ d x = − ∫ g t d t . {\\displaystyle \\int dx=-\\int gtdt.} Integrate to get x ( t ) = − 1 2 g t 2 + C . {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+C.} Once again, the constant is found from the initial condition, at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0} , x ( 0 ) = h {\\displaystyle x(0)=h} . Therefore, the position equation is x ( t ) = − 1 2 g t 2 + h {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+h} What we want is the time of impact. This happens when x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0} . So solve (2) for t {\\displaystyle t} . 0 = − 1 2 g t f 2 + h . {\\displaystyle 0=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt_{f}^{2}+h.} Rearrange to get t f = 2 h g {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {2h}{g}}}} Evaluate (3), using the value g = 9.8 {\\displaystyle g=9.8} , to get t f = ( 2 ) ∗ ( 381 ) 9.8 {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {(2)*(381)}{9.8}}}} t f = 8.82 [ s ] . {\\displaystyle t_{f}=8.82\\,\\,[s].} Finally, we get the velocity at impact by substituting (3) into (1) v ( t f ) = − g 2 h g . {\\displaystyle v(t_{f})=-g{\\sqrt {\\frac {2h}{g}}}.} Bringing g {\\displaystyle g} under the square root to get v ( t f ) = − 2 h g . {\\displaystyle v(t_{f})=-{\\sqrt {2hg}}.} This evaluates to v ( t f ) = − 2 ∗ 381 ∗ 9.8 = − 86.42 [ m / s ] . {\\displaystyle v(t_{f})=-{\\sqrt {2*381*9.8}}=-86.42\\,\\,[m/s].} In english units, the velocity is v ( t f ) = − 193.3 [ m i / h r ] . {\\displaystyle v(t_{f})=-193.3\\,\\,[mi/hr].} This is fairly fast for a penny, however this does not come very close to the actual speed because for such a large height, air resistance will become a big factor. In the next section we will model air resistance to capture this effect. Since the penny is traveling through the atmosphere (a fluid), we need to use some basic results from fluid mechanics to model the drag force acting on the penny. A simple model combined with experimental data results in the drag expression F d = 1 2 C d ρ A v 2 {\\displaystyle F_{d}={\\frac {1}{2}}C_{d}\\rho Av^{2}} where C d {\\displaystyle C_{d}} is the drag coefficient of the penny. It is an experimantly derived value and here we will use the value given by [1], C d = 1.17. {\\displaystyle C_{d}=1.17.} The drag force is in the opposite direction of the velocity vector as shown in the free body diagram in Figure 2. \\includegraphics[scale=1]{FreeBodyDiagram.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 2:} Free Body Diagram The density we will use is the standard day value at sea level given in the tables from [2], ρ = 1.225 [ k g / m 2 ] {\\displaystyle \\rho =1.225\\,\\,[kg/m^{2}]} Next A {\\displaystyle A} , is the effective cross-sectional area of the penny, From Wikipedia [3], the diameter of the US penny is D = 19.05 [ m m ] = 1.905 × 10 − 2 [ m ] {\\displaystyle D=19.05\\,\\,[mm]=1.905\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\,[m]} So the cross-sectional area is then A = π r 2 = π D 2 4 = 0.000286 m 2 {\\displaystyle A=\\pi r^{2}=\\pi {\\frac {D^{2}}{4}}=0.000286m^{2}} Combining all these constants gives us the drag force that is proportional to the square of the velocity F d = 0.0002 v 2 . {\\displaystyle F_{d}=0.0002v^{2}.} Now we have 2 forces to use with Newton's second law, this gives the acceleration equation as a ( t ) = 0.0002 v 2 m − g {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}-g} The integral setup is then ∫ d v = ∫ 0.0002 v 2 m d t − ∫ g d t . {\\displaystyle \\int dv=\\int {\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}dt-\\int gdt.} Unlike the free fall example, the analytical solution is a litte more difficult. However, all is not lost. We will first turn to numerical methods such as Euler's method or numerical programs such as Matlab, Octave or Maple and then later compare with analytical solution (coming soon). Here we will solve the differential equation using Octave [4]. First a little setup must be done to use Octave's lsode solver. The differential equation of motion that we will solve with the mass of the penny, m = 2.5 × 10 − 3 [ k g ] {\\displaystyle m=2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\,[kg]} [3] d 2 x d t 2 = 0.0817 ( d x d t ) 2 − 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}}=0.0817\\left({\\frac {dx}{dt}}\\right)^{2}-9.8} We cannot use a 2nd order differential equation in lsode, so we must use two 1st order equations. This is done by using two states, one for position and another for velocity. Then our equations of motion become y ˙ = y ˙ {\\displaystyle {\\dot {y}}={\\dot {y}}} y ¨ = 0.0817 y ˙ 2 − 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\ddot {y}}=0.0817{\\dot {y}}^{2}-9.8} The commands in octave are t = linespace(0, 100, 10000); y = lsode(\"penny\", [381 0], t); The function \"penny\" passed to lsode is here. The results are displayed in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5. \\includegraphics[scale=1]{figure1.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 3:} Penny's Velocity Note how the max velocity is now a measly − 10.952 [ m / s ] {\\displaystyle -10.952\\,\\,[m/s]} and that it stays constant for quite awhile up until impact. This is because the penny reaches what is called terminal velocity where the upward drag force at the terminal velocity cancels out the gravitational force, 0.0817 v t 2 = g {\\displaystyle 0.0817v_{t}^{2}=g} v t = g 0.0817 = 10.952 [ m / s ] . {\\displaystyle v_{t}={\\sqrt {\\frac {g}{0.0817}}}=10.952\\,\\,[m/s].} Figure 2 is a plot of the position and upon further inspection we see impact occurs at t f = 35.36 [ s ] {\\displaystyle t_{f}=35.36\\,\\,[s]} and the impact velocity is the terminal velocity v ( t f ) = − 10.952 [ m / s ] . {\\displaystyle v(t_{f})=-10.952\\,\\,[m/s].} \\includegraphics[scale=1]{figure2.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 4:} Penny's Position Finally, we will zoom in on the first few seconds of the fall to see the position before terminal velocity is reached. \\includegraphics[scale=1]{figure3.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 5:} First Few Seconds So to wrap things up, we see that air resistance makes a dramatic difference in the maximum velocity of the penny and the time of impact. In reality, the motion is a little more complicated due to winds and the fact that the penny will tumble, but understanding how a falling object reaches terminal velocity is something to take away. For a more detailed analysis of chaotic dynamics of disks, see [6] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]"]}

While Georgia is on many consumers’ minds when it comes to fresh, juicy peaches, California is by far the largest peach-producing State in the United States. In 2022, California’s harvest yielded 475,000 tons of fruit, with South Carolina a distant second at 67,400 tons, and Georgia in third place with production at 24,800 tons. California has been the long-time leading producer both for freestone peaches for the fresh market and clingstone peaches for processing. However, the State’s peach production has been trending lower for almost two decades, contributing to an overall drop in U.S. peach production. Total production in the United States in 2022 was estimated at 625,680 tons, 8 percent smaller than the crop in 2019. In 2022, California’s peach harvest was about 5 percent smaller than in 2019 and nearly 27 percent lower than 10 years earlier. Latest reports from USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service forecast 2023 peach production to be 13 percent lower than in 2022. Georgia and South Carolina peaches were beset with challenging weather conditions that included unseasonably warm weather in late winter followed by late spring cold snaps.

That same year, California was shown as the largest producer on a state level, with some 479 thousand tons harvested, representing about two thirds of the total national production. Fresh Georgia peaches are available only 12 weeks each year, from mid-May to early August. In Georgia, there are two commercial growing regions. The central region of Georgia is the largest with about 70% of the peach trees and 83% of the state’s production. What county grows the most peaches in Georgia? Macon County Macon County produced the most peaches with 2,515 acres, followed by Peach County with 2,371. And, of course, Georgia can thank a Macon County farmer for making this the Peach State. Standard peach trees grow 10 to 15 feet tall and can yield four to six bushels of fruit annually. Peach cultivars grown on dwarfing rootstocks stay between 5 and 7 feet tall and yield one to two bushels. While Georgia may be known as the Peach State, peaches have reigned as the official fruit of the Palmetto State of South Carolina — which, yes, produces more peaches than Georgia — since 1984. Why do peaches grow well in Georgia? The mild but cool Georgia winters and hot summers make a suitable climate for a variety of peach trees in the state. Traditionally, the heaviest commercial production of peaches in Georgia occurs in the midsection — roughly the swath from Columbus to Albany. 1.6 million peach trees Georgia has two commercial peach-growing regions. The central region is the largest with about 1.6 million peach trees and 75 percent of the state’s production….External sites. Georgia (particularly the Fort Valley plateau, where 90% of Georgia peaches are grown) historically has fewer hard freezes and more consistent rainfall and year-over-year temperatures than other peach-producing states. This means better peach flavor, but not quite so many peaches. How many peach farms are there in Georgia? Georgia has two commercial peach-growing regions. The central region is the largest with about 1.6 million peach trees and 75 percent of the state’s production….External sites. Peaches bear fruit on second-year wood, meaning proper pruning this year affects your crop yield next year. Prune trees in the early summer during the tree’s first, second, and third years of life. A standard peach tree can easily yield 100 to 150 pounds of fruit per year, and a dwarf variety can yield 50-60 pounds of peaches, respectively. How much do peach farmers make? Growers invest about $11,600 in a peach orchard during the first two years before they see a profit, with a third-year income of about $10,150 per acre, with $8,342 in grower costs, for a profit of about $1,800, , she said. The peaches in Dickey Farms in Georgia will ripen in late May or early June depending on the varieties of peaches. What states grow peaches? As of 2017, peaches are commercially produced in 20 states. The top four states in peach production are California, South Carolina, Georgia and New Jersey. What is the best fruit tree in Georgia? Yoshino Cherry Tree. The Yoshino cherry tree is another fruit tree commonly found in Georgia. In fact, this tree is so popular to the state that it is celebrated with a yearly festival in Macon , Georgia. This cherry tree is small in size and has beautiful, white to pinkish flowers, making it an attractive option for your yard. Where do peaches grow best? Peaches grow best in full sun in a location where cold air or frost will not settle. Peaches will tolerate partial shade but the yield will be diminished. Peaches prefer light, well-drained somewhat sandy soil with a soil pH ranging from 6.0 to 6.5. If the soil pH is lower than 6.0 add lime to the soil.

With 54,600 tons of peaches in 2018, South Carolina's production dwarfed Georgia's 25,000 tons, according to the states' agricultural overview reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The 2019 crop is shaping up to be strong in the South, analysts say. Even combined, though, production of South Carolina and Georgia is minor in comparison to the 510,000 tons of peaches produced by California, which is about five times the size of South Carolina. The United States trails in peaches globally, producing only 5 percent of the world total. China, the native land of peaches, produces 45 percent of the world crop, according to Clemson Cooperative Extension. According to USDA reports, the top 10 peach-producing states in 2018 were, in order, California, South Carolina, New Jersey, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Washington, Michigan, New York and West Virginia, which put out 6,500 tons of the fruit. Last year, social media posts pitted rival peach-producers in the South. Despite growing fewer peaches than South Carolina, the Georgia Department of Agriculture said Georgia was the superior producer with sweeter fruits. The South Carolina Department of Agriculture shot back with the classic \"Bless your heart.\" Andy Rollins, a horticultural extension agent with Clemson University, said the humor may have missed the forest for the peach trees. \"Even though there is some of that going on with the 'I-produce-more-than-you-ha-ha-ha' kind of stuff, I hope at the end of the day most people realize these guys are all really close friends for the most part,\" Rollins said of peach farmers on either side of the Chattooga and Savannah rivers. And pollinators generally know no borders. The state snack of South Carolina, in case you were wondering, is boiled peanuts. Georgia does not have a state snack but does claim grits as its official prepared food. More:The outlook for the 2019 SC peach crop is downright peachy with a critical month ahead More:9 decades of experience goes into those local peaches you love", "Revised February 2023. There are two basic types of peaches (Prunus persica): clingstone and freestone. With clingstone peaches, the flesh “clings” to the \"stone\" of the peach, making it difficult to separate, and thus more suitable for processing. The pit of freestone peaches \"freely\" separates from the flesh, making it ideal for fresh consumption. (Clemson University – Cooperative Extension, n.d.) The inside flesh of peaches exists in three different colors: yellow, white and the less common red. In the United States yellow-fleshed peaches are the most common, having a balanced flavor of sweet and tangy. White-fleshed peaches are very common in Asian countries; and recently there has been a growing demand for them throughout the United States. White-fleshed peaches have less acidity, and therefore lack the tangy flavor that yellow peaches exhibit (Clemson University – Cooperative Extension, n.d.) California clingstone peaches are available from July 10 to mid-September, while California freestone peaches are harvested from April 20 to October 10. The Southern states of Georgia and South Carolina provide peaches from May to August. For all other states the marketing season is from July to September. In 2017, 45 percent of the total peach production was sold through the fresh sector (NASS, 2018). To add value to your fresh peach crop, peaches can be sold on site by offering a U-Pick operation or through farm stands and local farmers’ markets. Selling the uniquely shaped variety known as Donut, Saturn or Saucer can also fetch more value (Visit California, n.d.). In 2017, 55 percent of the total peach production was processed. Of that 55 percent roughly 83 percent were canned, 17 percent were frozen, and the remainder were dried or used for other processed products (NASS, 2018). Peaches are not just for pies and cobblers anymore. Peaches have been processed into products such as, sorbets, yogurts, peach oil used in beauty products, and beer (Visit California, n.d.). As of 2017, peaches are commercially produced in 20 states. The top four states in peach production are California, South Carolina, Georgia and New Jersey. In 2017, California supplied nearly 56 percent of the United States fresh peach crop and more than 96 percent of processed peaches (NASS, 2021). United States total peach production in 2021 was 661,890 tons valued at $624 million. California led the nation in peach production, with 505,000 tons valued at $378.3 million. South Carolina followed, producing 87,400 tons (NASS, 2021). The bearing acreage of peach trees has been gradually declining for the past four decades. By 2020 the United States had 74,400 bearing acres of peach trees. The value of production, however, has been gradually increasing over the past four decades (NASS 2021). In 2021, fresh peach prices reached $339,870, up from $279,790 in 2018. Processed peach prices were $322,020, down from $358,230 in 2018 (NASS, 2022). Planning and preparation before starting any orchard is the surest way to receive success with your harvest (Pennsylvania State University, n.d.). Peach trees require chilling hours to induce flowering (600 chilling hours for low-chill varieties and 900 for higher chilling varieties). Peach trees can bloom relatively early in the spring, therefore areas that receive frosts after mid-April should not be used to establish a peach orchard. Peach trees also require a decent amount of heat for their fruit to ripen appropriately (Pennsylvania State University, n.d.). Peach trees are self-pollinating; therefore all trees of the same cultivar can be planted next to each other allowing easier harvesting. One of the most important management practices for peach trees is the thinning of their fruit. This allows for the trees to produce bigger more colorful fruit. The average spacing between each fruit should be about six inches (Pennsylvania State University, n.d.).

{"question": "Why do chameleons change colors?", "answer": "Chameleons change colors to regulate their temperature", "mgt": "Chameleons are able to change color due to a phenomenon called chromatophores, which are structures found in their skin cells. These chromatophores contain pigments that can be manipulated to reflect different wavelengths of light, resulting in the visible color changes. There are several reasons why chameleons change colors:\n\n1. **Camouflage**: One primary reason chameleons change colors is for camouflage. They can blend in with their environment by altering their hue to match grass, leaves, or other surfaces, making it difficult for predators to spot them.\n\n2. ** Regulation**: Some chameleons can change color in response to emotional or behavioral cues. For example, they may display different colors to communicate with other chameleons, attract a mate, or display dominance.\n\n3. **Thirst**: In some species, chameleons can adjust their skin color to regulate their body temperature. When they are hot, they may turn darker to absorb more heat, and conversely, when cooler, they will become lighter or even transparent to reflect more sunlight.\n\n4. **Biodiversity**: Different chameleon species have evolved unique color-changing mechanisms to adapt to their specific habitats and ecological roles. Some may change colors more rapidly or consistently than others.\n\nIn summary, chameleons change colors through the manipulation of pigments in their chromatophores, which allows them to adapt to their surroundings, communicate, regulate body temperature, and display various behavioral expressions.", "token_usage": 297, "human_written_evidences": ["Chameleons change colors to regulate their temperature; Chameleons change colors to protect their territory from other chameleons; Chameleons change color to attract a mate; Chameleons change color to impersonate females; It is a popular misconception that chameleons can blend into any background. They change color to communicate with other chameleons"], "reference_documents": [], "model_retrieved_documents": ["A chameleon changes its color to adjust its body temperature to the outside temperature. They change color by changing the arrangement of certain skin cells called iridophores. These cells have nanocrystals that reflect light of different wavelengths, depending on their physical orientation. The color-changing ability of chameleons has always intrigued human beings. We often think about how cool and easy life would be if we could change our colors, blend in with our surroundings, and camouflage ourselves just like a chameleon can. It would definitely help us escape from awkward situations more easily! Recommended Video for you:Chameleon Chromatics: How They Change Color and Why Recommended Video for you: Unlike octopuses and cuttlefish, who change color by moving around the pigment in their cells, chameleons have specialized cells called iridophores that do the job for them. A 2015 study published in Nature Communications looked at how five adult male, four adult female, and four juvenile panther chameleons changed their colors. They found that chameleons have two layers of these iridescent cells—iridophores. These iridophores have pigments and nanocrystals within them that reflect light of different wavelengths. The chameleon changes its color by exciting or relaxing its skin, changing the density of the upper layer of iridophores. A chameleon’s skin has a few different cell types that contribute to its color. The uppermost layer is composed of cells that contain a yellow pigment—xanthophores—and those that have red pigment—erythrophores—which are mainly present in striped regions. Under this layer lies the iridophores, which reflect different wavelengths of light depending on how they are packed and ordered. Finally, the last layer is composed of melanophores. These melanophores have extensions that reach the uppermost layer of the skin. When a chameleon is in a relaxed state, the nanocrystals in the skin are closer to each other and they reflect shorter wavelengths, like blue. When a chameleon is excited, the distance between nanocrystals increases and they reflect longer wavelengths, such as red, orange and yellow. These colors are seen most vividly in striped bands across the chameleon’s body. A chameleon’s green color is the result of yellow and blue wavelengths. The yellow from the xanthophores, plus the blue light reflected from the iridophores, results in the color green. In the relaxed, neutral state, the green is light and vibrant. When in a suppressed mood, such as when it needs to hide, the chameleon turns to darker shades, sometimes turning a dark brown. This is due to the melanophores dispersing pigment to the upper layers through their extension. Also Read: Can An Octopus Change The Way It Looks? Chameleons don’t change their color for camouflage, as most people think. They can’t perfectly match your crazy pink curtains or blend into your blue couch. As much as Pascal from Disney’s Tangled might change his colors on whim, alas, that is fiction for real chameleons, although their skin color does serve some camouflaging purposes. Chameleons spend most of their time in trees, high up amidst the brown branches and green leaves. Their own green and brown hues do allow them to blend into the leafy background, but their ability to change color isn’t intended for that. Chameleons, as recent research has found, change color for two main reasons—to communicate and to control their temperature. Animals have evolved different ways to communicate with one another. Humans primarily use language, fireflies use light, and chameleons use color. The chameleon’s color change can indicate its mood. An angry chameleon will have a darker color, whereas a chameleon in a relaxed mood will have a lighter color. A 2013 study looked at the coloration in male chameleons during competition with other males. The researchers reported that different coloration patterns in different body regions sent different signals to their competitors. Males with a darker head were more likely to win fights, while those with brighter stripes were more likely to approach their opponent first during the competition. This is mainly something that male chameleons do. Males might change their color to attract a mate. A male chameleon will switch to lighter hues to show the female how healthy and sexy he is, or he might darken his color if he sees another male. A chameleon, upon seeing a rival, changes its color to darker shades in order to assert dominance. Female chameleons also have color-changing abilities, but they are limited. They’re rather dull-colored in comparison to their male counterparts. The other reason some chameleons change their colors is the temperature. A cold chameleon will turn dark to absorb more heat, while a hot chameleon will turn lighter in order to reflect more heat away from its body. For example, the panther chameleon is found in open, dry environments like those of Yemen. The iridophores present in these chameleons help decrease the absorption of sunlight, which is crucial for survival. A study published in 1993 found that a dark coloration was frequently present in the morning time. The researchers concluded that this could serve to reduce basking time for chameleons. Color change in chameleons and other animals still isn’t fully understood. The range of occasions for which chameleons adapt their colors is still being outlined. The more exciting question seems to be how such color-changing evolved in the first place. From complex nanocrystal lattices to pigment dispersal in the blink of an eye, the intricate ways that animals change color is stunning, fascinating and downright magical!

As BBC News’ Jonathan Webb reports, reptiles are known to shift hues by two means. Warm and dark colors come from adjusting the dispersal of dark or light pigment in cells within skin layers; blues and whites, on the other hand, deemed “structural colors,” emerge “from light bouncing off physical elements” in their skin. Chameleons can adjust some skin pigments to appear lighter or darker. But until recently, scientists assumed the same sort of process was happening when the animals radically adjust their appearance into bright colors, like reds and yellows. Not so, argues the study, out this week in the journal Nature Communications. In observing and dissecting panther chameleons, the team of Swiss scientists found that the animals have “two superposed thick layers of iridophore cells—iridescent cells that have pigment and reflect light,” reports NBC News. Within these iridophore cells are a variety of nanocrystals that work together, according to the study’s lead author, Michel Milinkovitch, “as a selective mirror”. A chameleon can adjust the wavelengths of light reflected in these tiny crystals by either tightening or relaxing their skin, which changes the spacing of the cells. “Light will go through except for very specific wavelengths,” Milinkovitch told BBC. “If the distance between the layers is small, it reflects small wavelengths, like blue; if the distance is large it reflects larger wavelengths - for example, red.” The team watched this process in both live animals and in samples of chameleon skin. When they tensed the skin by drying it up, they saw the same drastic change in color apparent in live panther chameleons confronting, for example, a male competitor. The study also found that beneath the lattice of crystals was a deeper skin layer that reflects near-infrared light, which likely helps the lizard to stay cool in the heat of the sun. As Webb points out, the combination of color changing crystals and a reflective skin layer appears to be unique to chameleons; other lizards just have one or the other. And here’s a little bit of chameleon trivia: the animals’ radical color changes (which can take minutes to fully unfold) aren’t performed to blend in with their surroundings as children’s books might have us believe; rather, they change outfits to communicate to other lizards and to react to temperature or mood. And not all chameleons can go Technicolor—some can only range from green, brown and gray. But panther chameleons, found in Madagascar and the focus of this study, can exhibit exotic blues, yellows, greens and reds. And now we can thank crystals for the show.

Wonder of the Day #651 SCIENCE — Life Science Today’s Wonder of the Day was inspired by Lorilynn. Lorilynn Wonders, “Why do chameleons change colors” Thanks for WONDERing with us, Lorilynn! Did you ever just wish you could blend into the background? Perhaps you forgot to read all of your homework assignment and the teacher calls on you. Wouldn't it be great if you could make yourself look like a desk and chair? If you're a fan of lizards, you probably already know that there are some types of lizards — called chameleons — that can change their color. Have you ever wondered why — and how — they can do this? Chameleons are lizards that are part of the scientific family called Chamaeleonidae. In addition to the ability to change color, chameleons have many other characteristics that make them special, including parrot-like feet, eyes that can look in two different directions at once and long tongues and tails. Chameleons come in many colors, such as pink, blue, orange, red, yellow, green and turquoise. They can be found in Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. There are about 160 different species of chameleons, and they can live in both rain forests and deserts. Many people believe chameleons change colors to disguise themselves and hide from predators. However, chameleons are very fast — many can run up to 21 miles per hour — and can avoid most predators quite easily. Camouflage is thus only a secondary reason why most chameleons change color. So why would they want to change colors? Scientists believe that chameleons change color to reflect their moods. By doing so, they send social signals to other chameleons. For example, darker colors tend to mean a chameleon is angry. Lighter colors might be used to attract mates. Some chameleons also change colors to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature or light. For example, a chameleon that gets cold might change to a darker color to absorb more heat and warm its body. For many years, scientists believed that chameleons change their color by manipulating specialized cells — called chromatophores — that contain different colors of pigment. For example, when a chameleon wants to convey a particular mood or message, its brain sends a message to its chromatophores, which then move pigments around to change the chameleon's color. Today, researchers believe that pigments aren't the only mechanism chameleons use to change their colors. While pigments can account for warmer tones, such as greens, they can't explain brighter tones, such as reds and yellows. Recent studies have shown that chameleons also have a special layer of cells — called iridophores — under their skin. These special cells, which contain pigment and reflect light, are made up of hundreds of thousands of guanine crystals. Chameleons can relax or excite their skin, causing these special cells to move and change structure. Researchers found that, when this happens, these cells act like prisms, reflecting different wavelengths of light to create the variety of tones we see.

The 56 delegates to the Second Continental Congress represented the 13 colonies, 12 of which voted to approve the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. The New York delegation abstained because they had not yet received instructions from Albany to vote for independence. The Declaration proclaimed the signatory colonies were now \"free and independent States\", no longer colonies of the Kingdom of Great Britain and, thus, no longer a part of the British Empire. The signers’ names are grouped by state, with the exception of John Hancock, as President of the Continental Congress; the states are arranged geographically from south to north, with Button Gwinnett from Georgia first, and Matthew Thornton from New Hampshire last. The final draft of the Declaration was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4, although the date of its signing has long been disputed. Most historians have concluded that it was signed on August 2, 1776, nearly a month after its adoption, and not on July 4 as is commonly believed. The Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, with 12 of the 13 colonies voting in favor and New York abstaining. The date that the Declaration was signed has long been the subject of debate. Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams all wrote that it was signed by Congress on the day when it was adopted on July 4, 1776.[1] That assertion is seemingly confirmed by the signed copy of the Declaration, which is dated July 4. Additional support for the July 4 date is provided by the Journals of the Continental Congress, the official public record of the Continental Congress. The proceedings for 1776 were first published in 1777, and the entry for July 4 states that the Declaration was engrossed and signed on that date (the official copy was handwritten by Timothy Matlack).[2] In 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.[3] \"No person signed it on that day nor for many days after\", he wrote.[4] His claim gained support when the Secret Journals of Congress were published in 1821.[5] The Secret Journals contained two previously unpublished entries about the Declaration. On July 15, New York's delegates got permission from their convention to agree to the Declaration.[6] The Secret Journals entry for July 19 reads: Resolved That the Declaration passed on the 4th be fairly engrossed on parchment with the title and stile of \"The unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of America\" & that the same when engrossed be signed by every member of Congress.[7] The entry for August 2 states: The declaration of Independence being engrossed & compared at the table was signed by the Members.[7] In 1884, historian Mellen Chamberlain argued that these entries indicated that the famous signed version of the Declaration had been created following the July 19 resolution, and had not been signed by Congress until August 2.[8] Subsequent research has confirmed that many of the signers had not been present in Congress on July 4, and that some delegates may have added their signatures even after August 2.[9] Neither Jefferson nor Adams ever wavered from their belief that the signing ceremony took place on July 4, yet most historians have accepted the argument which David McCullough articulates in his biography of John Adams: \"No such scene, with all the delegates present, ever occurred at Philadelphia.\"[10] Legal historian Wilfred Ritz concluded in 1986 that about 34 delegates signed the Declaration on July 4, and that the others signed on or after August 2.[11] Ritz argues that the engrossed copy of the Declaration was signed by Congress on July 4, as Jefferson, Adams, and Franklin had stated, and that it was implausible that all three men had been mistaken.[12] He believes that McKean's testimony was questionable,[13] and that historians had misinterpreted the July 19 resolution. According to Ritz, this resolution did not call for a new document to be created, but rather for the existing one to be given a new title, which was necessary after New York had joined the other 12 states in declaring independence. He reasons that the phrase \"signed by every member of Congress\" in the July 19 resolution meant that delegates who had not signed the Declaration on the 4th were now required to do so.[14] In an 1811 letter to Adams, Benjamin Rush recounted the signing in stark fashion, describing it as a scene of \"pensive and awful silence\". Rush said the delegates were called up, one after another, and then filed forward somberly to subscribe what each thought was their ensuing death warrant.[15] He related that the \"gloom of the morning\" was briefly interrupted when the rotund Benjamin Harrison of Virginia said to a diminutive Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, at the signing table, \"I shall have a great advantage over you, Mr. Gerry, when we are all hung for what we are now doing. From the size and weight of my body I shall die in a few minutes and be with the Angels, but from the lightness of your body you will dance in the air an hour or two before you are dead.\"[15] According to Rush, Harrison’s remark \"procured a transient smile, but it was soon succeeded by the Solemnity with which the whole business was conducted.”[15] Fifty-six delegates eventually signed the Declaration of Independence: President of Congress New Hampshire Massachusetts Bay Rhode Island and Providence Plantations Connecticut New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Delaware Maryland Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Georgia Eight delegates never signed the Declaration, out of about 50 who are thought to have been present in Congress during the voting on independence in early July 1776:[16] John Alsop, George Clinton, John Dickinson, Charles Humphreys, Robert R. Livingston, John Rogers, Thomas Willing, and Henry Wisner.[17] Clinton, Livingston, and Wisner voted for independence, but were attending to duties away from Congress when the signing took place. Rogers, who had also voted for the resolution of independence, was no longer a delegate on August 2. Willing and Humphreys voted against the resolution of independence and were replaced in the Pennsylvania delegation before the August 2 signing. Alsop favored reconciliation with Great Britain and so resigned rather than add his name to the document.[18] Dickinson refused to sign, believing the Declaration premature, but he remained in Congress. George Read had voted against the resolution of independence, and Robert Morris had abstained—yet they both signed the Declaration. The most famous signature on Timothy Matlack's engrossed copy is that of John Hancock, who presumably signed first as President of Congress.[19] Hancock's large, flamboyant signature became iconic, and John Hancock emerged in the United States as an informal synonym for \"signature\".[20] Future presidents Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were among the signatories. Edward Rutledge (age 26) was the youngest signer and Benjamin Franklin (age 70) the oldest. Some delegates were away on business when the Declaration was debated, including William Hooper[22] and Samuel Chase, but they were back in Congress to sign on August 2. Other delegates were present when the Declaration was debated but added their names after August 2, including Lewis Morris, Oliver Wolcott, Thomas McKean, and possibly Elbridge Gerry. Richard Henry Lee and George Wythe were in Virginia during July and August, but returned to Congress and signed the Declaration probably in September and October, respectively.[23] New delegates joining the Congress were also allowed to sign. Eight men signed the Declaration who did not take seats in Congress until after July 4: Matthew Thornton, William Williams, Benjamin Rush, George Clymer, James Smith, George Taylor, George Ross, and Charles Carroll of Carrollton.[24] Matthew Thornton did not take a seat in Congress until November.[25] By the time that he signed it, there wasn't any space for his name next to the other New Hampshire delegates, so he placed his signature at the end of the document.[26] The first published version of the Declaration was the Dunlap broadside. The only names on that version were Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, and those names were printed rather than signatures. The public did not learn who had signed the engrossed copy until January 18, 1777, when the Congress ordered that an \"authenticated copy\" be sent to each of the 13 states, including the names of the signers.[27] This copy is called the Goddard Broadside; it was the first to list all the signers[28] except for Thomas McKean, who may not have signed the Declaration until after the Goddard Broadside was published. Congress Secretary Charles Thomson did not sign the engrossed copy of the Declaration, and his name doesn't appear on the Goddard Broadside, even though it does appear on the Dunlap broadside. Various legends emerged years later concerning the signing of the Declaration, when the document had become an important national symbol. In one famous story, John Hancock supposedly said that Congress, having signed the Declaration, must now \"all hang together\", and Benjamin Franklin replied: \"Yes, we must indeed all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.\" The earliest known version of that quotation in print appeared in a London humor magazine in 1837.[29]", "A chronology of the drafting, adoption, and initial publication of the nation’s founding document. 3 - 12 Social Studies, Civics, U.S. History Image After much debate, the Second Continental Congress ultimately agreed to the Declaration of Independence, and then signed it on August 2, 1776, in the Pennsylvania State House. The most well-known printed version of the United States' Declaration of Independence is emblazoned with the words \"In Congress, July 4, 1776\" at the top, and displays the signatures of John Hancock and other founding fathers at the bottom. Yet it is not true, as often believed, that the document was actually signed on that celebrated date. These historic events, central to the founding of the United States of America, deserve to be understood in detail.In May of 1775, the Second Continental Congress was seated in the Assembly Hall of the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia. Weeks earlier, hostilities had broken out between the British and colonial militias at Lexington, Massachusetts, and Concord, Massachusetts. King George III had not replied to the petition sent the prior October by the First Continental Congress, stating the colonists’ grievances. In August of 1775, the King declared the colonies to be in open rebellion. The Second Congress swiftly formed a Continental Army under the command of George Washington. By the middle of 1776, public sentiment in numerous colonies appeared to have turned decisively in favor of independence from Great Britain.Richard Henry Lee, a Virginia delegate acting on behalf of the Virginia Convention, proposed to Congress a resolution on independence on June 7, 1776. The first of three provisions in this resolution read as follows: \"Resolved, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.\" Other town and colonial assemblies were issuing similar pleas.Such a profound action demanded careful deliberation. On June 11, Congress put off a vote on Lee’s resolution. It appointed a five-member committee to draft a public statement that would explain the reasons for declaring independence should Congress so decide. John Adams of Massachusetts and Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania were on the committee, along with Robert R. Livingston of New York and Roger Sherman of Connecticut. The fifth member, Virginian Thomas Jefferson, was chosen to be the document’s principal drafter. After incorporating changes suggested by Adams and Franklin, the committee submitted its draft declaration to the Congress on June 28. This is the scene depicted in John Trumbull’s famous painting that now hangs in the Capitol Building rotunda in Washington, D.C.Congress debated Lee’s resolution on Monday, July 1. Nine colonies were prepared to vote in favor. The South Carolina and Pennsylvania delegations were opposed; the two Delaware delegates were deadlocked; and the New York delegates were unable to vote, since their instructions permitted them only to pursue reconciliation with the king. Overnight, however, the situation changed. On July 2, Caesar Rodney rode in to Philadelphia from Dover, Delaware, bringing a tie-breaking vote for Delaware in favor of independence. South Carolina shifted its position in favor, and the Pennsylvania opponents chose to stay away. When the vote was called on July 2, the Lee resolution passed by a vote of 12 to zero, with New York abstaining. After this historic decision, John Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, predicting that future Americans would commemorate their independence with a festival every second of July.Meanwhile, that same day in the New York harbor, British troops under Admiral William Howe landed at Staten Island. They were preparing for imminent battle with Washington’s forces.The full Congress then began debating the declaration, making substantial editorial revisions but leaving mostly untouched the soaring rhetoric of Jefferson’s opening paragraphs. On July 4, Congress approved the final draft. It ordered the statement printed and distributed to the colonial assemblies and divisions of the Continental Army.That evening, the printer John Dunlap prepared a large broadside with the complete text of “a Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled.” It is believed that about 200 copies of the Dunlap broadside were published on July 5; about 25 still exist today. At the bottom are printed these words: “Signed by Order and in Behalf of the Congress, John Hancock, President. Attest, Charles Thomson, Secretary.” The document was read aloud in front of the statehouse in Philadelphia on July 8. Over the next few weeks it was reprinted in newspapers up and down the Atlantic seaboard.On July 9, New York reversed its earlier instructions to its delegates, permitting them to join the other colonies favoring a formal break with Britain. A few days later, the news reached Philadelphia that the colonies were now unanimously for independence. On July 19, Congress ordered an official copy of the declaration to be “fairly engrossed”—written out in large handwriting—on parchment for the delegates to sign. This job went to Timothy Matlack, an assistant to the congressional secretary, Charles Thomson.On August 2, 1776, the Congress members affixed their signatures to this parchment inside the Pennsylvania State House, later renamed Independence Hall. The first and largest signature was that of the president of the Congress, John Hancock of Massachusetts. The mood in the room was far from jubilant. All were aware of the magnitude of what they were undertaking—an act of high treason against the British Crown that could cost each man his life. Recalling the day many years later, Pennsylvania’s Benjamin Rush wrote of the “pensive and awful silence which pervaded the house when we were called up, one after another, to the table of the President of Congress,” to sign “what was believed by many at that time to be our own death warrants.”Not every man who had been present in Congress on July 4 signed the declaration on August 2. Historians believe seven of the 56 signatures on the document were placed there later. Two prominent delegates passed up the chance to sign: John Dickinson of Pennsylvania and Robert R. Livingston of New York. The names of the signers were made public in January of 1777, when they were printed on another broadside edition of the Declaration published in Baltimore, Maryland.

View Transcript The Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. It was engrossed on parchment and on August 2, 1776, delegates began signing it. Although the section of the Lee Resolution dealing with independence was not adopted until July 2, Congress appointed on June 10 a committee of five to draft a statement of independence for the colonies. The committee included Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston, and Roger Sherman, with the actual writing delegated to Jefferson. Jefferson drafted the statement between June 11 and 28, submitted drafts to Adams and Franklin who made some changes, and then presented the draft to the Congress following the July 2nd adoption of the independence section of the Lee Resolution. The congressional revision process took all of July 3rd and most of July 4th. Finally, in the afternoon of July 4th, the Declaration was adopted. Under the supervision of the Jefferson committee, the approved Declaration was printed on July 5th and a copy was attached to the \"rough journal of the Continental Congress for July 4th.\" These printed copies, bearing only the names of John Hancock, President, and Charles Thomson, secretary, were distributed to state assemblies, conventions, committees of safety, and commanding officers of the Continental troops. On July 19th, Congress ordered that the Declaration be engrossed on parchment with a new title, \"the unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of America,\" and \"that the same, when engrossed, be signed by every member of Congress.\" Engrossing is the process of copying an official document in a large hand. The engrosser of the Declaration was probably Timothy Matlock, an assistant to Charles Thomson, secretary to the Congress. On August 2nd John Hancock, the President of the Congress, signed the engrossed copy with a bold signature. The other delegates, following custom, signed beginning at the right with the signatures arranged by states from northernmost New Hampshire to southernmost Georgia. Although all delegates were not present on August 2nd, 56 delegates eventually signed the document. Late signers were Elbridge Gerry, Oliver Wolcott, Lewis Morris, Thomas McKean, and Matthew Thornton, who was unable to place his signature with the other New Hampshire delegates due to a lack of space. Some delegates, including Robert R. Livingston of New York, a member of the drafting committee, never signed the Declaration.

The spelling and punctuation reflects the original. In Congress, July 4, 1776 The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

The famous text of the Declaration of Independence states \"In Congress, July 4, 1776.\" It is boldly signed by John Hancock and the other founders of the United States. Curiously, this wasn't the official date it was signed. The important declaration of the United States was actually drafted several times by brave leaders. Its history deserves a closer look.Beginning DraftsIn May of 1775, Congress gathered. Weeks earlier, hostilities broke out between the British troops and colonial soldiers in Massachusetts. Colonists were angered with Britain's rule in America. By August, the king declared the colonists to be rebels. Congress swiftly formed an army under the command of George Washington. Support was growing steady within the colonies for independence from Great Britain.On June 7, 1776, a lawmaker from Virginia named Richard Henry Lee proposed a resolution in Congress. It was written to convince Congress to demand independence from Britain. Other town and colonial groups were writing similar pleas. They insisted that the colonies should be free from ties to the Crown.This caused Congress to create a five-member committee to write a more detailed public statement. The committee would clearly explain the reasons for declaring independence. John Adams and Benjamin Franklin were on the committee. Robert R. Livingston and Roger Sherman were also chosen. Thomas Jefferson was selected to be the chief drafter. After including suggestions by Adams and Franklin, the committee gave its draft declaration to the Congress on June 28.Congress debated the declaration on July 1. At first, nine colonies were prepared to vote for independence. Two states were opposed, two were torn, and New York declined to vote. Then the situation changed overnight. On July 2, Delaware broke the tie in the vote for independence. Two states shifted in favor. When the vote was called on July 2, the declaration passed by a vote of 12 to zero. After this historic decision, John Adams wrote to his wife predicting that future Americans would mark their independence with a festival every second of July.Further Edits and First PrintingMounting concern about battle caused Congress to toil more over the declaration. They continued to edit, but made sure to use Jefferson's stirring words. On July 4, Congress approved the final draft.That evening, the complete version was set to print. It was called \"a Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America.\" It is believed that about 200 copies were published on July 5. Only about 25 still exist today. The paper was signed by John Hancock. It was read aloud in front of the statehouse in Philadelphia on July 8. Over the next few weeks it was reprinted in newspapers up and down the Atlantic coast.On July 9, New York finally agreed to the vote. A few days later, news reached Philadelphia that the colonies were fully united in the decision. On July 19, Congress ordered an official copy of the declaration for the delegates to sign.Signing The DeclarationOn August 2, 1776, Congress members signed the declaration. Not every man who had been present on July 4 signed the declaration on August 2. Two important officials passed up the chance to sign and others were added later.

Here’s how it works. Spoiler alert: It's not yellow Appearing as a whiteish yellow while overhead and redder when at the horizon, it's clear that the question \"what color is the sun?\" is actually more complex and difficult than it may initially sound. The sun emits light across all the visible colors in the electromagnetic spectrum fairly evenly. When these come together united in sunlight the sun appears white. This is useful because if this balance was thrown off colors less favored would be difficult to see. The sun is officially classified as a yellow dwarf star or a G2 V star. G2 designates the second hottest stars of the yellow G class of stars with surface temperatures between about 5,300 Kelvins (K) and 6,000 K. The V in this label represents a hydrogen-burning main sequence star or dwarf star. In terms of mass, the sun is at the upper end of this classification of stars. Related: How to observe the sun safely (and what to look for) Robert Lea is a science journalist based in the U.K. whose work has been published in Physics World, New Scientist, Astronomy Magazine, All About Space, Newsweek and ZME Science. Rob holds a bachelor of science degree in physics and astronomy from the U.K.’s Open University. When astronomers observe the sun they do so across a range of wavelengths of light — or electromagnetic radiation — including visible light and light not visible to the naked eye. These images of the sun in non-visible light are often reproduced in visible colors not usually associated with the sun. That means that is a veritable rainbow of exotically colored images of our star online that represent observations in different wavelengths of light. Understanding the color of the sun is tied to our understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum and these different wavelengths. Specialized instruments on NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) capture images in 10 different wavelengths, measured in angstroms (Å). Here are some examples of four images captured at 171 Å, 1700 Å, 131 Å and 094 Å by the SDO's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument. The visible light spectrum is just a tiny fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum that ranges from radio waves to microwaves and infrared light to X-rays and gamma-rays. These different types of electromagnetic radiation are comprised of photons with the key difference between them being their wavelength, frequency, and the energy these photons carry. These three properties are intrinsically related. Wavelength and frequency come from the wave-like properties of light with wavelength defined as the distance between the peaks of a wave and frequency defined as the number of wave peaks that pass a set point per second. Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional, so a longer wavelength means a reduction in the number of waves that pass a set point per second thus a reduction in frequency. Conversely, shortening the wavelength means more waves pass a set point per second and thus an increase in frequency. Wavelength and frequency are linked to energy by a factor called Planck's constant and as a result, energy is proportional to frequency and inversely proportional to wavelength. Applying this to the electromagnetic spectrum, radio waves have a long wavelength and thus a low frequency and little energy. On the other end of this spectrum, gamma rays have extremely short wavelengths and thus high frequencies and carry a lot of energy. The sun emits electromagnetic radiation across this spectrum except for gamma rays which it does generate in its core, but these high-energy photons bounce around the dense interior of the sun losing energy as they do so. This means when they finally escape the sun it is as longer wavelength, lower frequency, and lower energy photons. The quirks of the electromagnetic spectrum, energy, wavelengths, and frequency, have a discernable effect on how we see the sun from Earth. Most of us have, at some time, looked at the setting or rising sun on the horizon and noticed that it has taken on a red hue not usually seen when it is overhead. Likewise, as children we probably all asked a teacher or parent why the sky is blue. It turns out, both phenomena are related and are connected to the fact the sun emits photons across the visible light spectrum and these photons have different qualities. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than red or yellow light and shorter wavelength light is more easily scattered by gas molecules — a process called Rayleigh scattering. That means as white light from the sun travels through Earth's atmosphere blue photons get scattered more by molecules in the atmosphere while red photons slip right past them with little scattering. As a result, blue light has bounced all around the sky before it hits your eye. Photons of violet light are also scattered like this, but the sky isn't violet to us because the sun produces more blue photons and the human eye is more receptive to blue than it is too violet. Related: Why is the sky blue? Photons of red, orange and yellow photons reach your eye pretty much directly with little scattering when the sun is overhead, say at midday, and its light doesn't have to travel through much of Earth's atmosphere to reach the planet's surface. That's why the sky looks blue and the sun white with a yellow, red or orange tinge. — Does the sun rotate? — How hot is the sun? — When will the sun die? When the sun is on the horizon, at sunset, however, the situation is different as its light has to travel further and through a denser region of Earth's atmosphere to reach the planet's surface. This results in blue light being more strongly scattered and thus mostly removed from white light from the sun, this leaves mostly red light and makes the sun appear red. For this same reason, dust particles and pollution in the air can also cause the sun to take on dull shades of red and yellow or can even cause grey skies. Of course, the changes in the color of the sun as a result of these factors are superficial. The sun just appears to have taken on a different color. Eventually, however, our star will actually physically change color. This will be more than a mere palette swap and will be disastrous for the Earth and the planets in the inner solar system. In around 5 to 6 billion years the sun will exhaust the hydrogen that it converts to helium at its core as it comes to the end of its main sequence lifetime. The end of this nuclear fusion process also signals the end of outward pressure provided the energy it generates. Thought-out the sun's lifetime this outward radiation pressure has protected the sun from collapsing under its own inward gravitational pressure. When this 10 billion year or so balancing act ends the core of the sun will begin to collapse creating enough pressure to fuse helium in the core into heavier elements like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. The heat from the core will cause layers of the sun on top of the core to 'puff out' and hydrogen will begin fusing into helium in these layers. As the outer material of the sun expands outwards the temperature of these layers will drop and this will cause the energy of photons it emits to drop too. Lower energy light, as seen above, moves towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. This means the expanding sun will take on a reddish brown hue as it enters the aptly named red giant phase of its existence. Just as red often indicates 'danger' in nature, this expansion and reddening of the sun represent the final risk for the Earth. Many stars in the period of their existence can swell to as much as 400 times their original diameter. The outer shell of the sun is predicted to expand out to around 100 times the star's main sequence diameter. This means it will touch the orbit of Mars during this red giant phase. As a result the inner rocky planets of the solar system, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, will be swallowed by the expanding reddening star and destroyed. This won't be the final color change for the sun. As the outer shell of stellar material spreads out and cools further it leaves behind what was once the core of the sun. As this stellar ember continues to cool, after about 10 billion years it will become a smoldering white dwarf with a whitish-blue coloration. When what was once the sun's core runs out of elements to fuse it will fade and scientists think after trillions of years the sun become a black dwarf — a completely dead inert husk emitting no light what-so-ever and lunging what remains of the solar system into darkness. The Parker Solar Probe is the first craft from Earth explicitly designed to 'touch the sun' and will travel as close as 4 million miles to its surface revolutionizing our understanding of our star.

The reason the sun generally looks yellow is because the Earth’s atmosphere scatters other colors like blue, green, and violet more easily. On the other hand, colors like yellow, orange, and red are less easily scattered, giving the sun a yellowish appearance throughout the day and an orange / reddish hue near the horizon. There is a strange play of physics of light scattering that affects the color, and then the marginal effects of smoke, dust, and pollution contribute to making the sun appear yellow most of the time. I was still sceptical even when I first realized that the sun wasn’t yellow. To the naked eye, the sun doesn’t appear as a white burning star. However, to experience this white color of the sun, one would have to overcome the earth’s atmosphere – perhaps in the International Space Station (ISS)! Recommended Video for you:What Is The Actual Color Of The Sun? Recommended Video for you: The light emitted by the sun, which is visible to us, is only a tiny part of the huge electromagnetic spectrum. This electromagnetic spectrum consists of a wide range of different waves, ranging from gamma rays to radio waves. Visible light in this electromagnetic spectrum lies somewhere in the middle and is only a tiny part of the entire spectrum. The entire spectrum of visible light emitted by the sun can best be seen through a prism. With a prism, sunlight can be broken down into its components – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. These colors, from violet to red, are abbreviated as VIBGYOR. Purple has the lowest wavelength, while red has the highest wavelength. If all these colors are combined, it forms a white color, which is the real color of the sun. Another way to experience the individual components of the sunlight is when there is a rainbow. You can then see a beautiful spectrum of the VIBGYOR colors of visible light. You can observe VIBGYOR, i.e., the constituent colors of visible light, when there is a rainbow Also Read: In How Many Colors Can We See The Sun? The reason why the sun appears yellow to us is the Earth’s atmosphere. When sunlight hits atmospheric particles, it causes electrons and protons to vibrate rapidly up and down, generating radiation at the same frequency as the incident light but emitting in all directions. This process of redirecting sunlight is called scattering. The Earth’s atmosphere scatters away light in the blue, indigo, and violet wavelength region more prominently, while higher wavelength colors like red, orange and yellow are scattered sparsely. Due to this incongruous scattering, the Sun appears yellow. This is also why the sky appears blue during the day, as the blue wavelength is the most scattered color from the visible light spectrum.

If you are lucky enough to make it to the International Space Station one day, you can see the actual white color of the sun because it is not distorted by our atmosphere. From space, the sun will appear like a huge white glowing sphere. Some of you may wonder if the color of the sun really makes a difference. Well, the color of the Sun is actually significant for astrophysicists. A technique called spectroscopy is used to split the spectrum of light coming from a given star. This is done because splitting can give clues about the characteristics of the star from which the light is emitted. It can help astronomers estimate if a star is made of heavier elements or lighter elements, determining its age and behavior patterns. Color also helps scientists estimate the temperature of a star. Contrary to intuition, cooler stars are actually colored red. Betelgeuse, a relatively cool star with about 3500 Degrees Kelvin, has a decidedly reddish color. Hotter stars, such as Rigel, which lie above 10,000 Degree Kelvin, appear bluish. Our sun is estimated at 5800 Degree Kelvin, and when viewed from outside the Earth’s atmosphere, it appears white. For eons, we lived with the idea that the color of the sun is yellow. In fact, we are so accustomed to the idea of a yellowish sun that astronomers often artificially alter the images of our white sun to make it appear more “natural”! Now that you know all this, next time a teacher asks you to draw a picture of the Sun, draw it in white instead. If you’re asked why your sun is not yellow, give a quick lesson about the atmosphere, the light, and the world around it! Also Read: Why Do Stars Have Different Colors?

In space, the sun’s color would be white, but sometimes it can appear blue or red due to atmospheric conditions of other planets. (Keywords: sun color, color of sun, sun’s true color, true color of sun, what color is sun, what color is the sun in space, what color is the sun in outer space, sun’s color in space, what color is the sun really) Compared to its appearance from Earth, the sun’s color in space would appear white because there is no atmosphere present to scatter and cause color changes. The sun emits light in a spectrum of colors, including ultraviolet and infrared, that are not visible to the human eye.

Observations through telescopes provide insight into the various colors of the sun and its emissions.

In space, the sun appears white because there is no atmosphere to scatter its light. The sun’s visible color spectrum consists of different colors, ranging from violet to red. However, the sun also emits ultraviolet and infrared colors, which are not visible to the human eye. The sun’s color and temperature determine its emission lines and blackbody spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, which is essential for life on Earth. Overall, understanding the sun’s color spectrum in space is crucial for scientific research and space exploration. Photo Credits: colorscombo.com by Justin Hill The Sun’s Color from Earth Looking up at the sky during the day, we can see that the Sun appears as a bright, nearly white, light source. However, the Sun’s true color from Earth is a bit more complicated than that. From Earth, the Sun appears yellow due to the scattering of light in our atmosphere. This gives it a slightly reddish-orange tint when it is closer to the horizon during sunrise or sunset. The Sun’s visible light spectrum spans from red to violet. Interestingly, the Sun’s color in space is not the same as its visible color from Earth. In space, the Sun appears white because there is no atmosphere to scatter the light. Additionally, the Sun emits light across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, not just the visible portion. To better understand the different colors of the Sun, scientists study its color spectrum. The Sun’s color spectrum is a continuous curve that spans from infrared to ultraviolet. By analyzing this spectrum, scientists can learn more about the Sun’s composition and behavior. To observe the Sun’s visible light spectrum and true color, it is important to use the proper equipment and precautions to avoid damage to the eyes. For example, using a telescope with a solar filter or projecting an image of the Sun onto a screen. In summary, the Sun’s visible color from Earth appears yellow due to the scattering of light in our atmosphere, while in space it appears white. To better understand the Sun’s colors, scientists study its spectrum and use proper equipment and precautions to safely observe it. The atmosphere plays a crucial role in determining the color of the sun as seen from Earth. When sunlight enters Earth’s atmosphere, it undergoes a process called scattering, which causes blue light to scatter more than other colors, making the sky appear blue. This effect also impacts the color of the sun as seen from Earth, making it appear slightly yellow or reddish at sunrise and sunset due to longer atmospheric path length. However, during midday when the sun is higher in the sky, it appears white or light yellow due to shorter path length. Moreover, different colors of the sun can be observed through telescopes that filter out certain wavelengths of light, revealing its true spectrum. The sun’s true color is actually white but appears colored because of atmospheric effects. In space, without an atmosphere, its true color can be observed as white or slightly greenish due to emission spectra. Measurements from various space probes have also provided insight into the sun’s true color spectrum and chemical composition. Therefore, it can be concluded that while the atmosphere does have an impact on how humans perceive the color of the sun from Earth, careful observations from space reveal that its true color is white with slight variations depending on its position in relation to observers. Looking through a telescope, you might expect to see the sun’s true color – but don’t be fooled by its golden hue, it’s actually white! Understanding the sun’s color spectrum is crucial in observing its properties. Telescopes aid in providing an accurate depiction of the sun’s color from Earth. These observations showcase the various colors of the sun, including yellow and white hues. Apart from telescopes, atmospheric conditions also influence the perception of the sun’s color. The scattering of sunlight through Earth’s atmosphere causes a reddish or orange tint during sunrise and sunset. However, this effect doesn’t alter the sun’s true color. Observing the sun in space eliminates atmospheric influences, resulting in a more accurate representation of its true color. The absence of an atmosphere provides evidence that the sun is not entirely yellow, as perceived from Earth but has some blue and green as well. Measuring sunlight’s intensity and frequency using space probes further supports this understanding. Thus, considering different colors of the sun can provide valuable insight into its composition and behavior. To observe multiple wavelengths when viewing solar images through telescopes, utilizing filters recommended for such purposes could enhance accuracy in analysis. Moreover, analyzing polarization effects using polarizing filters with high precision helps better understand solar features like magnetic fields. Overall, by employing suitable equipment and analytical methods, researchers can gain valuable insights into our star’s behavior and characteristics. The sun in space may not have a catchy Instagram filter, but its true color is just as stunning. Photo Credits: colorscombo.com by Eric Lopez The true color of the sun in space is different than what we see on Earth. This is because Earth’s atmosphere distorts it. We can explore the sun’s true color. It can be measured from space probes. The atmosphere’s absence impacts its color too. In the absence of an atmospheric blanket, solar radiation reaches space directly without undergoing any diffraction or color alteration. Therefore, the sun’s actual hue and brilliance in space may differ from its apparent colors observed from Earth. The lack of air molecules or dust particles also allows visibility of invisible spectrums through telescopes. When viewed from space, the sun’s color appears similar to its true color, which is white. The perceived whiteness could be due to a balance between blue and yellow light since these hues are the most visible in the sun’s spectrum. When measured for its space color, the sun emanates electromagnetic wavelengths that fall primarily in the range of white light. Space probes have provided us with close-up images of the sun’s actual color, which complements previous observations and predictions. Pro Tip: While observing objects such as stars or planets in space, their apparent colors are frequently dependent on many factors such as atmospheric conditions and viewing angles. Understanding these factors can help astronomers in identifying characteristics like surface features or chemical composition with higher certainty. The sun’s true color: It’s not just a glowing orb of disappointment, it’s actually a dull white. The Sun’s true color is a topic of much scientific curiosity. When viewed from Earth, it appears yellow or white due to the scattering of light by our atmosphere. However, in space, without an atmosphere to scatter light, the Sun’s true color is actually a bright and pure white. Measurements from space probes such as NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory confirm this fact. Understanding the true color of the Sun has important implications in the field of astrophysics and beyond. Just like a bad dye job, measurements from space probes have revealed the sun’s true color in space – and it’s not what you’d expect. Measurements gathered from Space Probes provide accurate data about the Sun’s natural color in space. A Table with columns displaying wavelength range, color, and intensity shows that the sun emits light across the visible spectrum primarily in the yellow-green region. The measurements acquired using a variety of instruments from different probes such as SOHO, Helios, and HINODE show similar results consistently. In addition to providing information about the sun’s natural color, measurements from space probes also show changes in the sun’s color that occur due to solar flares or coronal mass ejections. During these events, there can be a temporary increase in ultraviolet and X-ray radiation which can affect our perspective of the sun’s natural color. Interestingly, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe discovered that when it gets closer to the sun during its mission, it observed a different hue of blue instead of white light. This is because of high-speed dust particles present in this region creating a sort of twilight zone around the Sun. Therefore, Measurements from Space Probes offer more precise data about the Sun’s true coloring in space – primarily yellow-green – while discoveries like those made by Parker Solar Probe continue to push understanding of our star forward.

(Source: Forbes) FAQs about What Color Is The Sun In Space What color is the sun in space? The sun in space is actually white, but it appears yellow to our eyes on Earth due to the atmosphere scattering the sun’s light. Does the sun have a color in space? Yes, the sun does have a color in space, and it appears as white. This is because there is no atmosphere in space to scatter the light, and the sun’s true color can be seen. Why does the sun look red in space photos? The sun can appear red in space photos due to the use of color filters on telescopes and cameras that highlight particular wavelengths of light. Additionally, certain processes on the sun’s surface can cause it to emit more red light, leading to a redder appearance in photos. What other colors can the sun appear in space? The sun can also appear blue or green in space photos, depending on the filters used and the specific wavelength of light being highlighted. However, these colors are less commonly seen than the white or red appearance of the sun. Is the sun’s color consistent throughout its life? No, the sun’s color changes over the course of its life. During its infancy, the sun was much brighter and bluer, while as it ages and expands it will become redder. In roughly 5 billion years, the sun will become a much larger and redder object known as a red giant. Can the sun ever appear black in space? No, the sun cannot appear black in space as it produces its own light. However, during a solar eclipse, the moon can block the sun’s light and cause it to temporarily appear black to observers on Earth.

Photo: European Space Agency An image of the Sun captured by the Solar Orbiter spacecraft on May 18, 2022. Photo: European Space Agency Sometimes the Sun appears yellow, in the evenings it seems red, it is white for astronauts in space and billionaire Elon Musk thinks it is green. But what colour is it, really? The star that helps keeps the Earth warm actually gives off light that spans many different hues, so it is not one particular colour. Scientists told The National that the Sun appears to us in different shades because of how its light scatters in Earth’s atmosphere. “What we perceive as colour is radiation within a narrow wavelength range,” said Dr Dimitra Atri, an astrophysicist at the New York University Abu Dhabi. “The Sun emits radiation across all wavelengths, making it a blend of colours and appearing white. It is the whitest object that we see. “However, due to the scattering of light in the atmosphere, it appears yellowish.” All of the planets in our solar system orbit the Sun, so its gravity is what keeps everything together. It is a 4.5-billion-year-old star made up of hydrogen and helium. Earth is habitable because it sits at a perfect distance from the Sun at about 150 million km – not too close and not too far. But our planet does get hit by intense solar flares – eruption of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun – every now and then, causing radio blackouts, power outages and damage to spacecraft in Earth's orbit. Dr Atri said that it appears redder in the morning and evenings because sunlight has to travel through more of the atmosphere, which contains dust and pollution at lower altitudes. “This atmospheric scattering is also why the Sun appears whiter when observed from airplanes, as there is less obstruction, and astronauts perceive it the same way from outer space as they have an unobstructed view of the sun,” he said. Dr Sarah Gallagher, director of the Institute for Earth and Space Exploration at Western University in Canada, also said that the colour of the Sun is perceived by humans depending on how our eyes and brains capture and interpret light. It also depends on what we are looking through when we look at the Sun – for example, how much of the Earth's atmosphere. A nice trick question is what color is the sun?It appears white in space, but, as measured by peak photon count, it is green. \"On Earth, we are looking at the Sun through our atmosphere, which tends to scatter out the higher energies (shorter wavelengths) of light – the purples and blues,\" she said. \"This is what makes the sky blue (the light doesn’t disappear, it just gets relocated), and the Sun looks yellow because the blue light has been taken out, and so it shifts the weight of the light reaching our eyes towards the red end of the rainbow. \"This becomes even more obvious during sunrises and sunsets, when the Sun’s light passes through more of the atmosphere, and so the Sun looks orange or red.\" SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk sparked a debate in December when he tweeted that the Sun was green. \"A nice trick question is what colour is the sun? It appears white in space, but, as measured by peak photon count, it is green,\" he said. While the Sun is what keeps the solar system intact, it is not going to \"live\" forever. Dr Atri said that Sun will eventually diminish in size and turn into a white dwarf star. \"In approximately five billion years, the Sun will undergo expansion and transform into a red giant, engulfing Mercury and Venus,\" he said. \"As a consequence, Earth will no longer be habitable. \"Some estimates even propose that our planet will eventually be consumed by the Sun. In that case, we might need to relocate elsewhere, maybe Titan, which could be a viable option. \"Once the Sun exhausts most of its fuel, it will diminish in size and evolve into a white dwarf star.\" Dr Gallagher said this was not \"an urgent problem\". \"Five billion years is a very long time though – it is approximately the current age of the Earth, and longer than there has been life on Earth,\" she said. \"Eventually, in about five billion years, the Sun will experience a much more dramatic transition as it runs out of hydrogen in its core and turns into a red giant star. \"At that point, it will expand and grow much brighter and cooler. It will grow so much that the Sun’s surface will extend to the Earth’s orbit, and the Earth will be swallowed by the Sun.\""]}

It is now sung to the tune of the French melody \"Ah! vous dirai-je, maman\", which was first published in 1761 and later arranged by several composers, including Mozart with Twelve Variations on \"Ah vous dirai-je, Maman\".[2] The English lyrics have five stanzas, although only the first is widely known.

The lyrics were first published with the tune \"Ah! vous dirai-je, maman\" in The Singing Master: First Class Tune Book in 1838.[5] When sung, the first two lines of the entire poem are repeated as a refrain after each stanza. \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" is sung to the French melody \"Ah! vous dirai-je, maman\". Additional variations exist such as 1. From the 1840 novel Poor Jack (chapter 4), by Frederick Marryat. Pretty little twinkling star, How I wonder what you are; All above the earth so high, Like a diamond in the sky. 2. From 1896 in Song Stories for the Kindergarten[7] by Mildred J. Hill. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How we wonder what you are. Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. When the glorious sun has set, And the grass with dew is wet, Then you show your little light, Twinkle, twinkle, all the night. When the golden sun doth rise, Fills with shining light the skies, Then you fade away from sight, Shine no more 'till comes the night. A parody of \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" titled \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat\" is recited by the Mad Hatter in chapter seven of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.[8] A version using synonyms from Roget's Thesaurus exists.[9] The opening lyrics are also used to begin the traditional murder ballad \"Duncan and Brady.\" The song can also be played as a singing game.[10]", "The composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is remembered for his precociousness, his prolific output, and his beautiful and memorable melodies. With all due respect to the famous opening bars of Eine kleine Nachtmusik, probably the most familiar melody associated with Mozart is known to English speakers as “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.” Indeed, it is commonly believed that the tune was one of Mozart’s earliest compositions, written when he was a child for his elder sister, Nannerl. Alas, the story isn’t true. What is true is that Mozart composed a set of variations of the tune for piano. Those variations were probably written in the early 1780s, when Mozart was a young man, and they may have been intended as piano exercises for the music students he taught. The complete work was published in 1785 and was described as variations on “Ah, vous dirai-je, Maman,” a French folk song that was popular at the time. Here’s a rough translation of that song’s lyrics (ah, the silliness of pre-Revolutionary France):Ah, Mother, if I could tell you / What causes my torment / Father wants me to reason / Like a grown-up / But I say that sweets / Are worth more than reason So who composed the tune itself? No one knows. The melody of “Ah, vous dirai-je, Maman” was first published (without words) in Les Amusements d'une Heure et Demy (1761), a collection of music to be played at garden parties. The collection is attributed to a man named Boüin, but there is no evidence that he personally wrote the music. Although some scholars have suggested that the tune might be as old as 1740, the identity of its composer is still a mystery. As for “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,” it originated as a poem written by the English author Jane Taylor and was published in 1806 as “The Star.” Sometime later the poem was set to the melody of “Ah, vous dirai-je, Maman.” (The earliest known appearance of the words and music together dates to 1838.) As you may have already realized, it’s not the only set of alternative lyrics for the tune. Among other songs that have made use of the melody are “Baa, Baa, Black Sheep,” the alphabet song (“A-B-C-D-E-F-G”), and a German sing-along (“Ist das nicht ein Schnitzelbank?”).", "The English nursery rhyme “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” is originally from the early 19th century. The melody is attributed to French composer Pierre-Louis Dietsch, and the lyrics are adapted from an English poem by Jane Taylor. The poem was first published in 1806, and the song was first published in 1838. The song has been adapted and translated into many languages, and it remains a popular children’s song to this day. The melody of “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” is also used in the opening bars of Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 16 in C major, K. 545. A favorite of children’s songs, ‘Twinkle, twinkle little star’ has been around for a long time. This poem is inspired by Jane Taylor’s poem from the nineteenth century. The melody is derived from the tune’Ah!’ by French composer Charles de Gaulle. Please come with me (‘Oh! Please come with me.’ Please tell me in your own words, Mama). Mozart wrote a solo piano version of the lullaby, which he had composed. In the lullaby ‘Twinkle Twinkle Little Star,’ the first verse of ‘The Star’ is usually heard. The poem can be sung to the melody in five stanzas. Haydn’s symphony No. 94’Surprise’ has been inspired by the song’s second movement, and opera house audiences have sung along to the song. Mozart wrote his first composition when he was 5 years old. It was a minuet in F major, and he titled it “K. 1”. Mozart began his musical career as a music composer for the Vienna court at the age of 17, and his life was forever changed when he moved to Vienna after graduating from college. His magnum opus, the Jupiter Symphony, is regarded as the most important symphony of all time. Mozart’s music has a strong expressive power and is known for its pure and delicate beauty. Today, many people recognize his intricate harmonies as a result of his orchestration. Although Mozart’s life was filled with tragedy, he did accomplish a lot. He died as a result of a bacterial infection at the age of 35 shortly after completing the Jupiter Symphony. Despite this, his music lives on. There is no definitive answer to this question as classical music is a broad and somewhat nebulous genre. However, it is generally agreed that classical music is art music that is rooted in the traditions of Western culture, typically including orchestral, chamber, and solo instrumental music. ” Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” is a popular lullaby that has been around for centuries, and while it is not typically considered classical music, it certainly has elements that are common in the genre. Ah! is a well-known nursery rhyme. In 1761, a novel written without words was published in France. Mozart composed a series of 12 improvisations based on this tune at the age of 25 or 26. Many other songs, including German, Hungarian, Spanish, and Turkish carols, incorporate the tune. Mozart composed a set of twelve variations of “Ah!” as a result of his composition. When he was 25 or 26 years old, he began learning to play the piano. Despite the fact that historians cannot pin down the exact date of Mozart’s composition, he most likely wrote the French melody while in Paris in 1768. Mozart wrote the variations for 12 of his works in 1785. Through the lines And a little light came down, it demonstrates how people can overcome darkness and gain hope. This is demonstrated by Mary using the light from the star to guide her to Jesus. In 1761, a French melody known as “Ah!” was popular. The book “Vous Dirai-Je, Maman” has been published. Many children’s songs, such as “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,” “Baa, Baa, Black Sheep,” and “Alphabet Song,” used the melody. This is the form of “Ah!” The title “Vous Dirai-Je, Maman” is derived from the song Theme and Variations. This method organizes musical ideas by allowing the audience to play the melody while the composer takes the melody and creatively changes it for the audience. Mozart’s twelve variations are numerous. “Vous Dirai-Je, Maman” has been around for over two centuries, and it is one of the most enduringly popular children’s songs because it is simple and memorable in its melody and lyrics. Lullaby songs can be soothing for children, and this one is one of them. “Ah, yes!” Whether you are a Classical music fan or not, it’s worth noting. “Vos Dirai-Je, Maman” is a song that should be added to your playlist. Mozart’s “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” Variations is a set of six variations on the popular children’s song “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.” Mozart composed the variations in 1781, when he was just 25 years old. The variations are written for solo piano and are some of Mozart’s most popular works. The variations range from simple to complex, and each one highlights a different aspect of Mozart’s genius. The first variation is the most famous and is known as the “Ah, vous dirai-je, Maman” variation. This variation is known for its catchy melody and simple, yet elegant, harmony. The second variation is more playful, with a light and airy feel. The third variation is more serious and dramatic, featuring a more complex harmony. The fourth variation is a beautiful and lyrical waltz. The fifth variation is a fast and energetic Presto. The final variation is a brilliant display of Mozart’s virtuosity, with rapid-fire scale passages and complex harmonies. Mozart’s “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” Variations is a timeless work that is sure to delight audiences of all ages. ABC Twinkle Twinkle Little Star is a children’s song that has been popular for centuries. The lyrics are simple and easy to remember, making it a perfect song for young children. The tune is catchy and will stay in your head long after you’ve sung it. Throughout history, a number of artists, including Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson, have recorded versions of the song. The song has even been used in films and TV shows, most notably in The Incredibles and Sesame Street. It has been around for hundreds of years and is a popular children’s song. Although the lyrics are based on a poem written in 1806 by Jane Taylor, we do not know who wrote it or why it was chosen. It has been covered by a wide range of artists over the years, and it has even appeared in a few films and TV shows. This family favorite is still in high demand today, and it can be enjoyed by both children and adults. There is no real answer to this question because it is impossible to sing the song “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” backwards. The song is simply too short and there is no way to reverse the lyrics without completely changing the meaning of the song.

Mozart was the first composer to set the tune to a classical piece of music in his 12 Variations (K. 265). It was written in 1781-82. Mozart weaves the tune throughout the 12 movements. Recently, Gerard Raiti at Disney sent me a disc of Variations on a Nursery Tune by Ernő Dohnányi. This is another classical piece that plays with the Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star tune. Dohnányi’s Variations is much more complex than Mozart’s. It refers to several other classical works, including pieces by Brahms, Wagner, and Debussy. There are 13 variations. You might have to listen through this piece several times to start getting a handle on all of its nuances. Here’s a link that gives an outline of the Variations. -Lisa Many thanks to Gerard Raiti for introducing me to the Variations on a Nursery Tune by Ernő Dohnányi!

Both halves may also release their stored moisture as a result of the injury.\n\nEarthworms, such as Lumbricus terrestris or Eisenia fetida, are annelids with a simple nervous system and a closed circulatory system. The front halves are capable of proprioception, or sensing their body position, but they cannot regenerate the severed section without specialized support or another intact worm to fuse the parts back together. The intact half can also feed on the remaining part of the earthworm corpse for nutrients.\n\nIn some cases, if the cut is close to the head, the front half might be able to生命力 be sustained longer and potentially move a short distance, but the chances of it surviving are usually slim.", "token_usage": 198, "human_written_evidences": ["If an earthworm is cut in half, the front half may survive; If an earthworm is cut in half, the front half may regenerate; If an earthworm is cut in half, the front half may become a new earthworm; If an earthworm is cut in half, it may die; An earthworm oftens dies when cut in half; It is not true that an earthworm will regenerate into two worms when cut in half.

Here’s how it works. It depends on the type of worm you're talking about, but most earthworms can't regenerate so easily. You may have been told as a child that an earthworm will regenerate into two new worms if it's cut in half crosswise. But if you've ever experimented with the tube-like animals, you've probably been disappointed. So, can earthworms be cut in half and turned into two? The answer, it turns out, is complicated, and depends on the species in question. Though it may not seem like it, earthworms (a term that encompasses 1,800 species in the genus Lumbricus) have a distinctive head and tail. The head of a worm is always located on the end closest to the swollen band, called the clitellum, that encircles the animal, Washington Post reported. If an earthworm is split in two, it will not become two new worms. The head of the worm may survive and regenerate its tail if the animal is cut behind the clitellum, according to The Washington Post. But the original tail of the worm will not be able to grow a new head (or the rest of its vital organs), and will instead die. Related: Decapitated worms regrow brains However, evolution has led to a type of \"worm\" that puts the earthworm's regenerative ability to shame: the planarium flatworm (phylum Platyhelminthes). This tiny invertebrate, which belongs to a separate phylum from earthworms, is able to reform its entire body from slivers just a tiny sliver of the animal's original body size, according to a 2014 study in the journal eLife. And when a planarian regrows its head after decapitation, the creature remarkably keeps all of its old memories, according to research published in the July 2013 issue of the Journal of Experimental Biology. In that experiment, they found that decapitated creatures still wriggled their way through a maze to food, even though they had been trained to find the food when they still had their heads. This effect occurred even if there was no brain tissue retained in the decapitated creature. Originally published on Live Science.

The head of the worm may survive and regenerate its tail if the animal is cut behind the clitellum. But the original tail of the worm will not be able to grow a new head (or the rest of its vital organs), and will instead die. Some species can also regenerate the very front of the head. Some non-British earthworms can even repeatedly re-grow lost tails, although other segmented worms beat that: many reproduce asexually by severing themselves repeatedly, and parchment worms can entirely regenerate from just their 13th body segment. In a survey of 35 species of marine ribbon worms, the researchers found that the ability to regenerate an entire head, including a brain, evolved relatively recently in four different species. Can earthworm live in water? Earthworms are unable to drown like a human would, and they can even survive several days fully submerged in water. Soil experts now think earthworms surface during rain storms for migration purposes. How can earthworms regenerate? The rules of regeneration Most earthworms can lose several segments from their head and grow them back. With the red wiggler, a worm often used in composting, the more head segments lost, the less likely they will be fully regenerated. Within eight days, you’ll have two or three fully functioning new worms, mouth, brain and all. If an earthworm is split in two, it will not become two new worms.

Some species of worms can regenerate, or re-grow, a new tail, if their tail is cut off. However, a worm cut too closely to its’ head will have difficulty growing a new tail. Can a head and tail of an earthworm be re-grown? The ability to re-grow body parts differs enormously between them, although tails are generally easier to re-grow.

Unlike some other types of ‘worm’ such as flatworms and nematodes (which are very distantly related to earthworms) if you cut an earthworm in half the parts will not become two worms. However, earthworms can survive if their tail end is cut off, and can regrow their segments but earthworms generally cannot survive if the front part of their body between the head and the saddle is cut as this is where their major organs are. Different species of earthworm are better at regenerating their tails than others but all can regrow to some extent. Some earthworms may deliberately amputate their tail when grasped by a predator and escape while the end still moves and distracts their attacker. The compost worm Eisenia fetida accumulates waste in its tail which gives it a yellow colour. When they cannot store any more they amputate the tail which removes the waste.

What you will end up with if you cut an earthworm in half is either a dead worm, or a shorter worm and half a worm carcass (which will decompose quite quickly). The anterior (head) region is the most important part of a worm – if it remains intact the worm can potentially survive, and may even grow a new tail (often somewhat stubby in appearance). The lower fragment however, once cut off from the rest of the worm, will simply die. There ARE in fact types of “worm” that can indeed regenerate from body fragments. Certain types of flat worms, such as planarians, are an example of a worm-like organism that can split in half to produce two new worms – in fact this is a form of asexual reproduction planarians can use to increase population size. These ‘worms’ are not related in any way to the earthworms however – while they are both in the kingdom Animalia, they are in entirely different phyla – flat worms are part of the phylum Platyhelminthes, while the true worms belong to phylum Annelida.

{"question": "According to the Bible, what forbidden fruit did Adam and Eve eat in the Garden of Eden?", "answer": "The Bible doesn't specify what kind of fruit Adam and Eve ate", "mgt": "According to the Bible, Adam and Eve are said to have eaten the fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden. This act is often referred to as \"the forbidden fruit.\" The tree was specifically prohibited by God because it would give them the ability to know good and evil apart from His guidance, thus straying from His divine plan.

They were given a command not to eat from a tree, which they did not follow and as the saying goes, the rest is history. One act of disobedience put mankind on this path that has led us to where we are today. This all started with some fruit, but what was that forbidden fruit in Genesis 2 where this account takes place? While there are no specifics on the type of fruit, there are some lessons we can learn from their experience. Photo credit: ©Getty Images/olga_d While we don’t know what that fruit was, somehow in many pictures and imageries an apple gets portrayed as that fruit. To clear up any confusion, here is what Genesis actually says about the fruit. “When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it” (Genesis 3:6). Here is all we know about the forbidden fruit in Genesis. It was good for food, meaning it was edible. It was pleasing to the eye, which means it was attractive. Finally, they thought it was desirable for gaining wisdom, which means they thought they would gain something from it. By the way these are the same trappings of sin that we are faced with today (more on that later). Because there are so many different types of fruit that grow on a tree, there really is no way of knowing what type of fruit it really was. (Sorry apples you have been blamed for something that you may have had nothing to do with.) In all honesty the type of fruit doesn’t matter. When you are reading the story, your focus should not be on what the forbidden fruit in Genesis was. It should be on the act of disobedience that Adam and Eve committed. Photo credit: Unsplash/Stephanie Harvey When you read the creation story you discover from Genesis that there were plenty of trees in the garden. “Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground — trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil” (Genesis 2:8-9). God put them in the garden and provided them with plenty of choices of food to eat. I would imagine that every type of tree bearing fruit was probably represented in the garden. This is only my speculation, but I would say think of any fruit that grows on a tree and it was probably available in the garden. I don’t have proof of this, but it is a reasonable assumption. There were however two important trees in the middle of the garden that were different from the rest. The tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The tree of life as it states gave life, particularly eternal life. The other tree would produce death. A question that often comes to mind is why was the tree of knowledge in the garden to begin with? For many Bible scholars the main answer is about free will. God created man for intimacy and fellowship with him, but from the very beginning this was not a forced fellowship, it is a chosen fellowship. From the beginning until today God gives every human the same free will. We can choose to follow and obey or we can choose to go our own way. Photo credit: ©Getty Images/Unsplash This is the question of the ages, but I don’t want to hate on Eve too much. Eve fell victim to temptation in much the same way we do. I want to show you what happened to Eve because this still plagues us today. To keep it simple, Eve rejected what God had provided in search of something else or something different. I want you to consider the similarities between the fruit on all the trees in the garden. In Genesis 2:9 and Genesis 3:6 you see that the trees were good for food (edible) and pleasing to the eye (attractive). What was different about the fruit on the tree of knowledge? She thought she would obtain something that the other trees did not provide her. The serpent influenced her to believe that God was holding out something from her. Remember what she said that highlights the difference. The fruit was good for food, pleasing to the eye and – here’s the difference – desirable for gaining wisdom. I don’t believe Eve ate the fruit simply because it was edible and looked good. There were plenty of other trees that had those characteristics. She ate the fruit because it promised her something she did not have and wanted to gain or experience. Often this is how sin works in our lives. God has provided everything we need for this life, just as he did with Adam and Eve. So what is it about sin that looks so attractive to us? It promises something that we have not experienced or something that we can gain from it. The problem is that this is an empty promise and the consequences never live up to the expectations. The result of eating the forbidden fruit was sin entering the world and all the pain and suffering that happens as a result. As God promised, death happened. This was not physical death, but spiritual death that caused a separation between God and man because of sin. Adam and Eve were kicked out of the garden. I know Adam and Eve did not know the gravity of the action they committed when it happened. However, I think it is safe to say they came to understand quickly how bad a decision they had made. I believe they experienced remorse just like we often do when we endure the result of our sinful decisions. Remember they were the only ones in human history who ever lived on this earth in a sinless environment. I am sure they longed for the days when they could go back to Eden as it was. Unfortunately, with sin, sometimes it costs us more than we want to pay and there are some things you lose that you can’t get back. Photo credit: ©Getty Images/Cas Photography If the story of Adam and Eve was just about fruit and getting kicked out of the garden that would be a tragedy. Yet there was something else that happened in that garden that gives us hope. The choice of Adam and Eve set in motion God’s plan of redemption. While eating the forbidden fruit might have been a decision Adam and Eve did not know they would make, it was one that God knew they would make. From the moment the forbidden fruit in Genesis was eaten, the promise of the savior who would redeem mankind was made. In Genesis 3:15, God made a promise about the seed of the woman crushing the head of the serpent. We know that seed is Jesus who would come and redeem us back to the Father. Through Adam we lost it all, but in Christ we gained back all that was lost. “For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous” (Romans 5:19). The ultimate end of our righteousness in Christ is that one day we will be able to eat from the tree of life and so be with our Lord forevermore. Never again will we have to deal with the issue of sin for all eternity. Yes, Adam and Eve set the sin wheels in motion, but thankfully Jesus has turned it all around. “Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him. They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever” (Revelation 22:1-5).

Proud member of Salem Media Group.", "Forbidden fruit is a name given to the fruit growing in the Garden of Eden which God commands mankind not to eat. In the biblical story, Adam and Eve eat the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and are exiled from Eden: And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. As a metaphor outside of the Abrahamic religions, the phrase typically refers to any indulgence or pleasure that is considered illegal or immoral. The story of the Book of Genesis places the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, in the Garden of Eden, where they may eat the fruit of many trees, but are forbidden by God to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. In Genesis 3, a serpent tempts the woman: And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. Desiring this knowledge, the woman eats the forbidden fruit and gives some to the man, who also eats it. They become aware of their nakedness and make fig-leaf clothes, and hide themselves when God approaches. When confronted, Adam tells God that Eve gave him the fruit to eat, and Eve tells God that the serpent deceived her into eating it. God then curses the serpent, the woman, then the man, and expels the man and woman from the Garden before they ate of the tree of eternal life. According to the Quran, Surah Al-A'raf 7:19 describes Adam and his wife in Paradise where they may eat what is provided, except for one Tree they must not eat from, lest they be considered Ẓālimūn (Arabic: ظالمون; 'wrongdoers').[3] Surah Al-A'raf 7:20–22 describes Shaitan (Arabic: شيطان), who whispers to Adam and his wife and deceives them. When they tasted of the tree, their nakedness was exposed to them, prompting them to cover themselves with leaves from Paradise.[4] Then their Lord called out to them, \"Did I not forbid you from that tree and ˹did I not˺ tell you that Satan is your sworn enemy?\" A Gnostic interpretation of the story proposes that it was the archons who created Adam and attempted to prevent him from eating the forbidden fruit in order to keep him in a state of ignorance, after the spiritual form of Eve entered the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil while leaving a physical version of herself with Adam once she awakened him. However, the forces of the heavenly realm (Pleroma) sent the serpent as a representative of the divine sphere to reveal to Adam and Eve the evil intentions of their creators. The serpent succeeded in convincing them to eat the fruit and become like gods, capable of distinguishing between good and evil.[5] The word fruit appears in Hebrew as פֶּ֫רִי‎, pərî. As to which fruit may have been the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden, possibilities include an apple, grapes, a pomegranate,[6] a fig,[7] carob,[6] etrog or citron,[6] pear, quince, and mushrooms. The pseudepigraphic Book of Enoch describes the tree of knowledge: \"It was like a species of the Tamarind tree, bearing fruit which resembled grapes extremely fine; and its fragrance extended to a considerable distance. I exclaimed, How beautiful is this tree, and how delightful is its appearance!\" (1 Enoch 31:4).[8] In Islamic tradition, the fruit is commonly either identified with wheat or with grapevine.[9] In Western Europe, the fruit was often depicted as an apple. This was possibly because of a misunderstanding of – or a pun on – two unrelated words mălum, a native Latin noun which means 'evil' (from the adjective malus), and mālum, another Latin noun, borrowed from Greek μῆλον, which means 'apple'. In the Vulgate, Genesis 2:17 describes the tree as \"de ligno autem scientiae boni et mali\": \"but of the tree [literally 'wood'] of knowledge of good and evil\" (mali here is the genitive of malum). According to the Bible, there is nothing to show the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge was necessarily an apple.[10] The larynx, specifically the laryngeal prominence that joins the thyroid cartilage, in the human throat is noticeably more prominent in males and was consequently called an Adam's apple, from a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit getting stuck in Adam's throat as he swallowed it.[11] Rabbi Meir says that the fruit was a grape, made into wine.[12] The Zohar explains similarly that Noah attempted (but failed) to rectify the sin of Adam by using grape wine for holy purposes.[13][14] The midrash of Bereishit Rabah states that the fruit was grape,[15] or squeezed grapes (perhaps alluding to wine).[16] Chapter 4 of 3 Baruch, also known as the Greek Apocalypse of Baruch, designates the fruit as the grape. 3 Baruch is a first to third century text that is either Christian or Jewish with Christian interpolations.[17] The Bible states in the book of Genesis that Adam and Eve had made their own fig leaf clothing: \"And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves girdles\".[18] Rabbi Nehemiah Hayyun supports the idea that the fruit was a fig, as it was from fig leaves that Adam and Eve made garments for themselves after eating the fruit. \"By that with which they were made low were they rectified.\"[19] Since the fig is a long-standing symbol of female sexuality, it enjoyed a run as a favorite understudy to the apple as the forbidden fruit during the Italian Renaissance, Michelangelo Buonarroti depicting it as such in his masterpiece fresco on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.[20] Proponents of the theory that the Garden of Eden was located somewhere in what is now known as the Middle East suggest that the fruit was actually a pomegranate, a plant indigenous from Iran to the Himalayas and cultivated since ancient times.[21] The association of the pomegranate with knowledge of the underworld as provided in the Ancient Greek legend of Persephone may also have given rise to an association with knowledge of the otherworld, tying-in with knowledge that is forbidden to mortals. It is also believed Hades offered Persephone a pomegranate to force her to stay with him in the underworld. Hades is the Greek god of the underworld and the Bible states that whoever eats the forbidden fruit shall die. Rabbi Yehuda proposes that the fruit was wheat, because \"a baby does not know to call its mother and father until it tastes the taste of grain.\"[12] In Hebrew, wheat is khitah, which has been considered to be a pun on khet, meaning \"sin\".[6] Although commonly confused with a seed, in the study of botany a wheat berry is technically a simple fruit known as a caryopsis, which has the same structure as an apple. Just as an apple is a fleshy fruit that contains seeds, a grain is a dry fruit that absorbs water and contains a seed. The confusion comes from the fact that the fruit of a grass happens to have a form similar to some seeds.[22] A fresco in the 13th-century Plaincourault Abbey in France depicts Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, flanking a Tree of Knowledge that has the appearance of a gigantic Amanita muscaria, a psychoactive mushroom.[23] Terence McKenna proposed that the forbidden fruit was a reference to psychotropic plants and fungi, specifically psilocybin mushrooms, which he theorized played a central role in the evolution of the human brain.[24] Earlier, in a well-documented but heavily criticized study,[25][26] John M. Allegro proposed the mushroom as the forbidden fruit.[27] Several proponents of the theory that the forbidden fruit was a banana exist dating from the 13th century. In Nathan HaMe'ati's 13th-century translation of Maimonides's work The Medical Aphorisms of Moses, the banana is called the \"apple of Eden\".[28][29] In the 16th century, Menahem Lonzano considered it common knowledge in Syria and Egypt that the banana was the apple of Eden.[30] Charles George Gordon identified the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge with the coco de mer.[citation needed] The similarities of the story to the story of Pandora's box were identified by early Christians such as Tertullian, Origen, and Gregory of Nazianzus.[31]", "Get our Question of the Week delivered right to your inbox!", "Internet Explorer is no longer supported.

Share In Genesis chapter 2, we read about a real tree, with real fruit, that grew in the Garden of Eden—the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Adam was told he could eat from any tree in the garden except that one tree. Many people wonder what the fruit on that tree looked like, with a popular option being an apple. A recent headline from LiveScience even asked, “Was the ‘forbidden fruit’ in the Garden of Eden really an apple?” So, was it? Well, the LiveScience article correctly states, “Nobody knows because the Hebrew Bible just says ‘fruit.’” In the article (which treated Genesis like an interesting legend, not as real history), the author offers a few suggestions from various scholars (such as fig, wheat, grapes, or citron) and sum up the history of how an apple might have become associated with the biblical narrative. In a 2010 article, AiG’s Bodie Hodge also summed up that history: So the fruit that was “good for food” and “pleasant to the eyes” probably was not an apple. But we do know that it was a real fruit, growing on a real tree, in real history—and the impact of the rebellious eating of that fruit is still felt acutely today by every single person (in fact, the whole creation). You see, Adam and Eve’s choice to sin against their Creator brought death and suffering into God’s once “very good” creation. Now creation groans, waiting for the coming of Christ and the new heavens and new earth he will create (Romans 8:22). But God didn’t leave Adam and Eve without hope. In Genesis 3:15, he promised that the Seed of the woman was coming and that he would crush the head of the serpent—that Seed was Jesus, the Last Adam. He lived the perfect life we can’t live, died on the cross in our place as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, and then rose again, defeating sin and death. Now Jesus offers new and eternal life, forgiveness, and freedom from sin and death to all who will turn from their sin and trust in him. So while we can’t know what that fruit in the Garden looked like, every person has the opportunity to trust in Christ for salvation and know for themselves in eternity what the fruit on a different tree—the Tree of Life—looks like (Revelation 22:2). In that glorious day, the consequences of that rebellious bite into the “forbidden fruit” will be gone, all because of our great and merciful God “who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all” (Romans 8:32): This item was discussed today on Answers News with cohosts Bryan Osborne, Tim Chaffey, and Roger Patterson.

{"question": "Has MSG been scientifically proven to be harmful to humans in small doses?", "answer": "No, there are no rigorous scientific studies showing that MSG is harmful to humans in small doses", "mgt": " MSG, or monosodium glutamate, is a flavor enhancer that has been widely used in various food products since the early 20th century. It is a naturally occurring compound found in many foods, primarily in foods that contain proteins, like soy sauce, tomatoes, and mushrooms. The consensus among scientific organizations and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is that MSG is generally safe when consumed in normal amounts.\n\nIn small doses, MSG has not been found to cause any significant health problems. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies MSG as \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS), which means it has an established history of safe use in food and is not likely to cause adverse effects at the levels typically found in food. Several studies have been conducted, including those conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), to examine its safety.\n\nHowever, some people may experience a temporary subjective reaction known as \"Chinese restaurant syndrome\" after consuming large amounts of MSG, which can include symptoms like headaches, flushing, and sweating. This is believed to be an allergic or sensitivity reaction, rather than a direct physiological harm from the compound.\n\nIt's essential to note that individual tolerances to MSG can vary, and some individuals might be more sensitive than others. If a person experiences symptoms from consuming MSG, it could be a sign of an intolerance or sensitivity rather than a harmful effect.

While some people may be more sensitive to MSG than others, experts generally consider it safe, especially in smaller doses. Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is a flavor enhancer that has been widely used for roughly 100 years (1). In addition to being naturally present in certain foods, it’s a common food additive in Chinese recipes, canned vegetables and soups, and other processed goods. For years, MSG has been viewed as an unhealthy ingredient. However, newer research questions the accuracy of its purported adverse effects on human health. This article examines MSG and what current evidence has to say about its health effects. MSG is short for monosodium glutamate. It’s a flavor enhancer derived from L-glutamic acid, which is naturally present in many foods. L-glutamic acid is a nonessential amino acid, meaning that your body can produce it by itself and doesn’t need to get it from food (1). MSG is a white, odorless, crystalline powder commonly used as a food additive. In the food industry, it’s known as E621. It dissolves easily in water, separating into sodium and free glutamate (2). It’s made by fermenting carb sources like sugar beet, sugar cane, and molasses (3). There’s no chemical difference between the glutamic acid found naturally in some foods and that found in MSG. This means your body can’t differentiate between the two types (3, 4, 5). MSG has a specific taste known as umami — the fifth basic taste alongside sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. Umami has a meaty flavor that refers to the presence of proteins in food (2, 6). Besides MSG, other umami compounds include inosine 5’-monophosphate (IMP) and guanosine 5’-monophosphate (GMP) (1). MSG is popular in Asian cooking and used in various processed foods in the West. It’s estimated that people’s average daily intake is 0.3–1.0 grams (1, 7). The flavor-enhancing effects of MSG are due to its umami taste, which induces salivary secretion. In other words, umami flavors make your mouth water, which can improve the taste of food (6). What’s more, studies show that umami substances can lower the desire to salt foods. Salt is another flavor enhancer (6, 8). In fact, some research postulates that replacing some salt with MSG can reduce people’s sodium intake by approximately 3% without sacrificing flavor (1, 8). Similarly, MSG may be used as a salt substitute in low sodium products like soups, prepackaged meals, cold meats, and dairy products (8). MSG is derived from L-glutamic acid, an amino acid found in your body and many foods. It’s a popular food additive used to enhance flavor. It can be used to reduce overall sodium intake when used in place of salt. MSG got its bad reputation in the 1960s when Chinese-American doctor Robert Ho Man Kwok wrote a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine explaining that he got sick after consuming Chinese food. He wrote that he believed his symptoms could have resulted from consuming either alcohol, sodium, or MSG. This sparked a host of misinformation about MSG, which was likely related to then-present biases against Chinese immigrants and their cuisine (9). The letter led to the designation of Kwok’s symptoms as the “Chinese restaurant syndrome,” which later became the “MSG symptom complex” (MSC) (1). Later on, numerous studies backed MSG’s bad reputation, stating that the additive was highly toxic (1). However, current evidence questions the accuracy of previous research for several reasons, including (1): Today, health authorities like the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Food Safety Association (EFSA) consider MSG to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) (1, 4). They have also determined an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 14 mg per pound (30 mg per kilogram) of body weight per day. This is far more than the amount you’d typically ingest following a normal diet (1, 4). While racial biases and older research implied that MSG was a toxic additive, current evidence and health authorities recognize it as safe. MSG has been linked to obesity, metabolic disorders, brain toxicity, and MSC. Here’s what the current research has to say about these purported downsides (7). Older evidence states that by making food taste better, MSG disrupts the signaling effect of the hormone leptin in your brain. Leptin is in charge of telling your body that you’ve had enough to eat. In turn, this is said to increase your calorie intake (7, 10). However, the current data on MSG’s effects on energy intake is contradictory. Some studies have found that it may reduce appetite, while others support the idea that its flavor-enhancing properties could lead to overeating (1, 6). The contradictory results might have to do with the nutritional profile of a meal. For example, eating MSG-enhanced, high protein meals has been linked to increased feelings of fullness, while this link hasn’t been observed with high carb meals (1). However, this could also be because protein is the most filling macronutrient — it might not have anything to do with the MSG content (1). Other studies note that eating MSG-enriched meals could cause you to eat fewer calories at subsequent meals and reduce your energy intake from non-MSG-enriched and savory, high fat foods (1, 11). Ultimately, more research on the connection between MSG and energy intake is needed. MSG has been associated with an increased risk of metabolic disorders, primarily due to animal studies that have linked the additive to insulin resistance, high blood sugar levels, and diabetes (2, 7). However, previous research has used imprecise methods for determining MSG consumption, such as injections instead of oral doses. This could lead to effects on the brain that are not associated with dietary intake (1, 2, 12). What’s more, the current data is contradictory. For instance, newer animal studies have found an association between umami substances and anti-obesity effects. In contrast, other animal and human studies show no effect on body weight (6, 12). While it appears that typical dietary MSG intakes are unlikely to influence body weight or fat metabolism, more human studies are needed (12). Glutamate plays many important roles in brain function. For starters, it acts as a neurotransmitter — a chemical substance that stimulates nerve cells to transmit signals (1, 2). Some studies claim that MSG can lead to brain toxicity by causing excessive glutamate levels in the brain to overstimulate nerve cells, resulting in cell death (2, 7). However, dietary glutamate likely has little to no effect on your brain, as almost none of it passes from the gut into the blood or crosses the brain barrier (1, 4, 12, 13). In fact, research shows that once ingested, MSG is completely metabolized in your gut. From there, it either serves as an energy source, is converted to other amino acids, or is used in the production of various bioactive compounds (1, 4). Overall, no compelling evidence suggests that MSG alters brain chemistry when consumed in normal amounts. Some people may experience adverse effects from consuming MSG due to a condition called MSG symptom complex (MSC). It’s estimated to affect less than 1% of the general population (1). MSC is characterized by symptoms similar to those described by Dr. Kwok in his letter. They include weakness, flushing, dizziness, headache, numbness, muscle tightness, difficulty breathing, and even the loss of consciousness (1). The threshold dose that causes short-term and mild symptoms in sensitive people appears to be 3 or more grams of MSG without food (1, 5). Keep in mind, though, that a 3-gram dose is a high one. A typical serving of an MSG-enriched food contains less than half a gram of the additive, so consuming 3 grams at one time is highly unlikely (5). Current evidence debunks most of the beliefs that consider MSG harmful or dangerous. However, in some cases, research findings are contradictory, and further studies in humans are needed. MSG is naturally present in many different foods, especially those that are high in protein. It’s also added to ingredients and other foods during processing (1, 4). Common foods that contain MSG are (1, 6, 14, 15): Additionally, fast-food chains like McDonald’s, Chick-fill-A, and KFC use MSG to season menu items like fried chicken, chicken nuggets, and fries (16, 17, 18). MSG is naturally present in many foods, including some cheeses, meats, and vegetables. It’s also added to some processed and fast-food items. MSG is a flavor-enhancing additive that’s also naturally present in many protein-rich foods, cheeses, and vegetables. Although it was considered a toxic ingredient during the 1960s, current evidence has dispelled that myth, indicating that MSG is safe when consumed in moderate amounts. Still, you shouldn’t eat excessively large doses or consume it if you experience adverse reactions. Try this today: There’s no compelling reason to avoid MSG if you don’t experience side effects when consuming it. That said, if you’d like to reduce your intake of added MSG, be sure to check the ingredient panel of packaged foods and condiments. The FDA requires that foods that contain this additive mention it on their packaging.

USA TODAY has reached out to the poster for comment. Fact check:Social media posts on Subway tuna DNA test lack context MSG is a common flavor enhancer and preservative that has been in global use for the past 100 years. Its unsavory reputation has been largely based on flawed scientific studies in animals and humans, which have been debunked by more recent research. First discovered by Japanese biochemist Kikunae Ikeda, MSG is made up of sodium and glutamate, one of the most abundant amino acids found within the human body and nature. Glutamate plays a crucial role in neuromuscular development, metabolism and many other vital biological functions. MSG by itself doesn't have much flavor, but when it's added into certain foods, it stimulates and heightens taste buds on our tongues that sense umami, a Japanese portmanteau meaning a pleasant, savory taste. When Ikeda first happened on MSG in 1907, he had distilled it from a glutamate-rich seaweed broth used extensively in Japanese cuisine. Today, MSG is made by fermenting starch, corn, wheat, beets or other sugar-rich foods with bacteria that eat the sugar and spit out proteins abundant in glutamic acid, an alternative form of glutamate. (Foods like yogurt, kimchi and sauerkraut also are made via fermentation.) Fact check:Contact with wild parsnip harmful to humans and animals Humans have been eating glutamate-rich foods, like tomatoes and cheese, for centuries. MSG has long been associated with Chinese cooking, but it's also used to flavor Caribbean and Latin American sauces, Doritos, sandwiches at Chick-fil-A, low sodium products and many other processed foods, Dr. Stephen Prescott, president of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, wrote in The Oklahoman. Health concerns over MSG arose in 1968 after a Chinese-American doctor wrote a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine wondering if the flavor enhancer was the cause for his heart palpitations, numbness and weakness felt whenever eating at a Chinese restaurant. The letter, published under the title \"Chinese-Restuarant Syndrome,\" spawned a flurry of animal and human studies in which subjects were given MSG either through an injection or orally. One 1969 study by Washington University researcher Dr. John Olney found injecting significantly large doses under the skin of newborn mice led to impaired brain development, stunted growth, obesity and infertility in female mice. Olney repeated the same experiment, this time giving MSG orally to rhesus monkeys, and came to a similar finding. But later, in 19 other monkey studies by other researchers, no one observed results anything like Olney's. In one human study where 71 healthy people were given either MSG or a placebo, both groups complained of symptoms like headaches or numbness roughly at the same rate, even when participants were swapped to the other option. In following years, many organizations, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the National Academy of Sciences, the World Health Organization and the American Medical Association, all declared MSG safe to eat. Fact check:Meat digested like any other protein source In 1992, the FDA launched a formal review of MSG's supposed ill effects, and in 1995 it concluded it was safe overall, although it may cause mild, short-term reactions like headaches, numbness and palpitations in a tiny part of the population. The report noted that the symptoms tended to occur in people who ate more than 3 grams of MSG without food. The typical serving of food with MSG added is less than 0.5 grams. Consuming six times that amount without food at one time is unlikely, the FDA said on its MSG question-and-answer website. A 2009 study found dietary glutamate does not cross the blood-brain barrier – a system of blood vessels that regulates what goes in and out of the brain and spinal cord – in large amounts and so is unlikely to affect brain function. A 2020 review of studies involving MSG also found many of its reported negative health effects \"have little relevance for chronic human exposure and are poorly informative as they are based on excessive dosing that does not meet with levels normally consumed in food products.\" The impact of MSG on weight has been less clear-cut. Some studies have suggested it can cause weight gain, but others show there is no connection between the two. We rate the claim that MSG is a deadly brain toxin that causes neurological disorders and other health problems FALSE, based on our research. MSG is a naturally occurring food substance that has been used for more than 100 years. Claims that it can be dangerous to human health are based on flawed scientific studies that have been debunked by more recent research. A small population of people may be sensitive to MSG, but the effects are short-term and not life-threatening. Thank you for supporting our journalism.

Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a flavor enhancer often added to restaurant foods, canned vegetables, soups, deli meats and other foods. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified MSG as a food ingredient that's generally recognized as safe. But its use is still debated. For this reason, when MSG is added to food, the FDA requires it to be listed on the label. MSG has been used as a food additive for many years. During this time, the FDA has received many reports of concerning reactions that people have attributed to foods that had MSG in them. These reactions — called MSG symptom complex — include: But researchers have found no clear proof of a link between MSG and these symptoms. Researchers admit, though, that a small number of people may have short-term reactions to MSG. Symptoms are often mild and don't need to be treated. The only way to prevent a reaction is to not eat foods that have MSG in them. With Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D. There is a problem with information submitted for this request.

All rights reserved.", "Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a controversial food additive that people use to enhance flavor. Many people associate it with Asian cuisine, though it is an ingredient in a variety of foods, including processed meats, soups, and fast food. Historically, many people have believed that MSG can lead to various health conditions. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that MSG is generally safe to consume. In fact, it is already naturally present in the human body. This article will examine the reasons that people may consider MSG harmful and give science-backed evidence as to whether or not these assumptions are accurate. It will also list some of its uses and known health effects. MSG stands for monosodium glutamate. This is a form of glutamic acid, which is an amino acid that is present in many different natural foods. Glutamic acid performs many functions in the body, such as forming proteins. Glutamic acid is a precursor for the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA is abundant in the nervous system and plays a vital role in inhibition, or signal calming. The FDA classifies MSG as generally safe. There is not enough evidence to support a link between MSG consumption and the adverse reactions that people have reported. Researchers cannot conclusively say that MSG has caused the reactions in these reports. The FDA asked the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) to investigate adverse reactions to MSG. The FASEB stated that adverse reactions could only be possible in people who may have sensitivities and who have consumed more than 3 grams (g) of MSG. Since a typical serving of food with MSG contains only 0.5 g of MSG, reactions are unlikely following typical meals. MSG is a bright, white powder similar to salt. In 1908, a professor at the University of Tokyo in Japan extracted MSG for the first time from seaweed. Manufacturers now typically produce it by fermenting starch, sugar cane, or molasses. This fermentation process is similar to the method that people use to make vinegar, wine, and yogurt. It naturally produces MSG, which manufacturers then purify and dry. The resulting crystalline structure dissolves readily during cooking to enhance the flavors of the dish. According to one 2017 study, people have been using MSG to season their food for over 100 years. Some people in Japanese cultures consider MSG, or umami, to be one of the five basic tastes. Many dishes featured in Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian cuisine use MSG. According to one 2018 study, the following food products may also contain MSG: The first mention of MSG potentially being harmful to human health was in a letter that a Chinese physician sent to the New England Journal of Medicine in 1968. The physician said that he had noticed palpitations and numbness in his neck, back, and arms after he had eaten Chinese food. The New England Journal of Medicine dubbed this “Chinese restaurant syndrome.” This term is now outdated, and people use the term “MSG symptom complex” instead. Despite the author mentioning that his symptoms may have been the result of a number of dietary factors — including sodium, alcohol, and MSG — the publication highlighted MSG as being the main cause. Over the years, people have proposed many different reasons as to why MSG may be harmful to human health. However, there is not always enough scientific evidence to prove that these claims are true. The belief that MSG can cause brain damage may have stemmed from a study in 1969 that investigated the effect of injecting large doses of MSG into newborn mice. The investigators noted that the MSG caused neuronal cell death in several areas of the developing brain. For example, the MSG damaged the hypothalamus, which plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis. However, it is not possible to compare the effects of injecting large amounts of MSG into newborn mice with the effects of humans ingesting small amounts of MSG from food into their gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, this study does not provide enough evidence to support this claim. There is not enough evidence to suggest that MSG can cause brain damage in humans. Some people believe that MSG can cause obesity. One 2011 study that involved more than 10,000 Chinese adults concluded that MSG caused the participants to gain weight even in the absence of processed foods or a lack of physical exercise. However, a 2017 systematic review that mentioned this study goes on to say that this result may be due to the fact that MSG may influence a person to overeat. Moreover, a 2010 study concluded that MSG does not cause obesity at all. It is worth mentioning that because MSG makes food taste better, people may be more tempted to overeat. Learn what a person should weigh for their height and age here. Some evidence suggests a link between MSG and obesity, but this may happen because MSG makes food taste better. Many people say that they experience headaches after eating foods containing MSG. However, one 2016 review stated that there is no evidence to support a link between MSG consumption and headaches. Previously, the International Headache Society mentioned MSG in their list of headache triggers. In 2018, however, they removed MSG from this list. Learn about some possible causes of headaches here. Evidence to suggest that MSG causes headaches is purely anecdotal. Historically, some people believed that there was a link between MSG consumption and cancer risk. However, a 2017 systematic review stated that since the 1960s, there have been no studies that have confirmed this link. Learn more about how diet affects cancer risk here. There is no evidence to suggest that MSG can cause cancer. Some people have reported experiencing asthma episodes after eating MSG. One older 1987 study appeared to confirm this. The researchers gave 32 people large doses of MSG, and 40% of them later experienced an asthma episode. However, more recent studies — such as one 2012 study into the link between MSG, diet, and asthma in adults and one 2012 study into MSG and asthma in adults and children — have found no correlation between asthma and MSG consumption. It is also worth mentioning that studies involving high doses of MSG may not be reliable in a real-life setting. According to the FDA, it is unlikely that a person will consume enough MSG from food to experience any adverse reactions. Learn more about asthma triggers here. Recent studies have not found a correlation between MSG consumption and asthma episodes. One 2019 review mentions that some people have reported being hypersensitive to MSG. The New York Allergy and Sinus Centers have stated that this is a sensitivity rather than an allergy. Symptoms of this may include: The amount of MSG in food would not be enough to cause a serious adverse reaction. Alleged hypersensitivities to MSG are only based on people’s reports. According to the 2019 review above, there is not enough solid evidence to confirm that a hypersensitivity to MSG exists. The review called for more studies into sensitivities involving both naturally occurring MSG and added MSG. Despite this, if a person feels that they may have an MSG sensitivity or notices symptoms after eating food containing MSG, they should stop eating it. Keeping a food diary may also help. Learn about MSG symptom complex here. Some people report having a sensitivity to MSG. There is not enough evidence to confirm that MSG sensitivity exists, but if a person experiences symptoms after eating MSG, they should not eat it. MSG occurs naturally in food and in the body. Some manufacturers add it to food, such as fast food, to improve flavor. Many reputable organizations over the world, including the FDA, state that MSG is safe to eat. Historically, there have been reports of various adverse reactions to MSG. However, there is not enough evidence to support this. Studies that have found links between MSG and certain health concerns have used amounts of MSG that a person is unlikely to consume as part of a meal. If a person does feel that they have a sensitivity to MSG, they can stop eating it.

{"question": "What happens if you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair?", "answer": "If you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, you might feel cold", "mgt": "If you go outside in cold weather with wet hair, you risk developing hypothermia. Here's a detailed explanation based on the facts:\n\n1. Hypothermia: When your body's core temperature drops below its normal range (usually 95°F or 35°C), it can lead to serious health complications. This can occur when you're exposed to cold temperatures and your body loses heat faster than it can produce it, especially when your body is wet.\n\n2. Wet hair as a heat sink: Wet hair is an excellent conductor of heat, meaning that when it's cold, it can absorb and transfer warmth from your scalp to the air much faster than dry hair. In cold weather, this can cause your body to lose heat rapidly.\n\n3. Insulation loss: With wet hair, your body's natural insulation, which includes your scalp and hair, is compromised. This makes it more difficult for your body to retain heat.\n\n4. Shivering and slurred speech: As your core temperature decreases, your body may try to generate heat by shivering. Shivering can cause muscle contractions, which can be painful. Additionally, shivers can lead to slurred speech and loss of coordination.\n\n5. Frostbite: If the cold weather persists and wet hair continues to sap heat from your body, frostbite can occur, particularly in extremities like your ears, nose, and fingers. Frostbite is a tissue damage that can progress to more serious complications like gangrene if untreated.\n\nIt's essential to protect yourself from hypothermia by dressing warmly, drying your hair, and avoiding prolonged exposure to cold temperatures with wet hair. If you do find yourself in this situation, seeking shelter and drying your hair as soon as possible are crucial steps to take.", "token_usage": 355, "human_written_evidences": ["If you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, your hair may freeze; If you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, you might be cold; If you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, you might feel cold; If you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, your hair may be damaged; If you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, your scalp may dry out; If you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, strands of your hair might snap easily; If you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, nothing will happen; You won't catch a cold if you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, but you might feel chilly"], "reference_documents": [], "model_retrieved_documents": ["", "Have you ever been in a rush to get out the door and left the house with wet hair? While it may seem like a harmless time-saver, going outside with wet hair can actually be detrimental to your health. Here are a few reasons why you should avoid this common mistake: Going outside with wet hair can increase your risk of catching a cold or the flu. When your hair is wet, it absorbs more water and becomes heavy, which can lower your body temperature and weaken your immune system. This makes it easier for viruses and bacteria to invade your body and cause illness. To avoid getting sick, be sure to dry your hair completely before venturing outside in cold or wet weather. Wet hair is more vulnerable to damage than dry hair. When your hair is wet, it is in a weakened state and can become more easily tangled, leading to breakage and split ends. Additionally, the sun’s UV rays can be more damaging to wet hair than dry hair, leading to color fading and dryness. If you want to keep your hair healthy and looking its best, avoid going outside with wet hair and wait until it is completely dry before styling or going out in the sun. Wet hair can also cause skin irritation, particularly on the neck and shoulders. When wet hair comes into contact with the skin, it can cause redness, itching, and irritation. This can be particularly problematic for individuals with sensitive skin or those who are prone to eczema or psoriasis. To avoid skin irritation, be sure to dry your hair completely before wearing clothes that expose your neck or shoulders. In conclusion, going outside with wet hair may seem like a time-saver, but it can actually be detrimental to your health and the health of your hair. By taking the time to dry your hair completely before venturing outside, you can reduce your risk of illness, hair damage, and skin irritation. So, the next time you’re in a rush to leave the house, remember to take a few extra minutes to dry your hair and protect your health and wellbeing.

Having wet hair does not cause colds, colds are caused by a virus. There is no association of the virus with wet hair. During below freezing temperatures, going outside with wet hair might increase the risk of hypothermia. So, if you were planning to go outside in cold weather with wet hair and without a jacket, you might want to reconsider. Even though you do not get sick from wet hair, your hair becomes more prone to breakage in cold weather. Water expands in volume during freezing temperatures, so it forces the hair shaft to expand and lifts hair cuticles.

Earth Future Planet Health Gap Sustainability on a Shoestring Time: The Ultimate Guide The Next Giant Leap Green Tech Best of BBC Future Latest More “You’ll catch your death of cold”, my grandmother always used to warn me, if I ever dared to leave the house on a winter’s day without drying my hair properly. For centuries there has been an idea across many parts of the world that you will develop a cold if you are exposed to low temperatures, particularly if you get wet as well. We even use the words “cold” or “chill” to describe the combination of a sore throat, runny nose and cough that you end up with. But, as any doctor will tell you, the common cold is caused by a virus. So if I have just washed my hair, but I really need to leave the house urgently, should I worry about my grandmother’s warning? Seasonal triggers Living in Britain, I will naturally begin by examining the weather. Studies in Germany and Argentina have found a higher incidence of colds in the winter, while in warmer countries such as Guinea, Malaysia and the Gambia peaks have been found during the rainy season. We could conclude from these studies that cold or wet weather causes colds, but there is an alternative explanation. When it is freezing or raining we spend more time indoors in close proximity to other people and their germs. So what happens when we get cold or wet? Scientists have set up experiments under laboratory conditions where they lower the temperatures of volunteers and deliberately expose them to a cold virus. But overall the studies have been inconclusive. Some studies found the chilly group were more likely to succumb to a cold, others found they were not. However, a study conducted in a different manner offers the intriguing suggestion that there could be some truth to the saying. Ron Eccles, director of the Common Cold Centre in Cardiff, UK wanted to know whether getting cold and damp activates the virus, which then sets off the sneezing and streaming. To do so, people were chilled under laboratory conditions, but then they returned to their real lives and mingled with people, including those who had a cold virus present in their nose or throat without becoming ill with symptoms. Half of Eccles’ volunteers had to sit with their feet in cold water for twenty minutes, while the other half kept their socks and shoes on, but sat with their feet in an empty bowl for the same length of time. There was no difference in the cold symptoms reported between the two groups in the first few days, but four to five days later twice as many people in the cold-water group said they had developed a cold. Lower defences For this to make any sense there needs to be a mechanism by which getting chilled feet, or for that matter wet hair, could give you a cold. One theory is that when your body gets chilled the blood vessels in the nose and throat constrict. These same vessels deliver infection-fighting white blood cells, so if fewer white blood cells reach the nose and throat your defences against a cold virus are lowered for a short time. When your hair dries off or you go indoors your body warms up again, your blood vessels dilate, and the white blood cells continue to fight the virus. But by then it could be too late and the virus might have had enough time to replicate and trigger the symptoms. So although we talk about “catching a chill”, the chilling has not given us the cold, but might have activated a virus already present at the back of the throat. Bear in mind though, that this area is still controversial, and Eccles’ study only demonstrated that more people who had been chilled said they had cold symptoms. No medical tests were done to confirm that they were definitely infected with the virus. One final point is that there is a curious parallel with Norwegian health folklore, which says that women are more likely to develop cystitis when the weather is cold. Researchers found that cooling people’s feet did seem to activate cystitis in some women, suggesting that the same process might be occurring in the urinary tract, as in the blood vessels of the nose and throat. So there might well have been some truth in my grandmother’s advice not to go out with wet hair. It will not give you a cold, as she said, but it might trigger one. In the meantime, until more research is carried out I think I will dry my hair before I go outside.

{"question": "How long should you wait between eating a meal and going swimming?", "answer": "You do not need to wait between eating and swimming", "mgt": "It is generally recommended to wait about an hour after eating a meal before swimming. This allows your body to digest the food, particularly if the meal was substantial, to prevent discomfort or potential cramping. Swimming on a full stomach can also increase the risk of水上 accommodations, such as pool floats or ladders, becoming more slippery due to the saliva and digestive juices. To ensure a safe and enjoyable experience, it's best to give your body enough time to process the meal before engaging in water activities.", "token_usage": 100, "human_written_evidences": ["You do not need to wait between eating and swimming; You can swim immediately after eating; There is no hard and fast rule for how long you should wait to swim before eating; A common misconception is that you need to wait 2 hours between eating and swimming, but this isn't necessary"], "reference_documents": [], "model_retrieved_documents": ["You’ve probably heard it countless times growing up: wait at least 30 minutes or an hour to swim after eating. This age-old advice has been passed down from generation to generation, but have you ever wondered where it came from and whether it holds any truth? You don’t need to strictly adhere to the 30-minute rule before swimming if your concern is drowning. However, it’s still a good rule to follow to avoid the discomfort of muscle cramps and exercising on a full stomach, which can negatively affect your performance. Since each individual’s response to food and exercise may vary, you must determine your own limits and make educated decisions about when to dive back into the water. Keep reading on to learn more about how you can eat before swimming. Table of Contents You might have grown up hearing that you should wait at least 30 minutes or perhaps even one hour after eating before diving into the pool or swimming in the ocean. This popular belief stems from the idea that after a meal, blood is diverted away from your limbs and towards your digestive system to help process the food. This would then lead to muscle cramps and even the risk of drowning. In reality, this myth has been around for generations and has become an ingrained part of our cultural wisdom. It’s likely that our grandparents, and even our great-grandparents, heard the same advice growing up. The fear behind the myth likely comes from a combination of wanting to keep children safe around water and misinterpreting the body’s natural processes. The truth of the matter is that the idea that it is necessary to wait to swim after eating is largely fiction. While it’s true that blood flow does increase to your digestive system after eating a meal, it doesn’t divert enough blood away from your arms or legs to make swimming dangerous. In fact, swimmers and athletes often eat before their workouts or competitions to give their bodies the energy and necessary nutrients to perform optimally. You might be more prone to getting a side cramp in your abdomen from eating, but it is not a major risk factor to the point that you should be fearful of your life. To put it simply, there’s no concrete scientific evidence to support the idea that you must wait to swim after eating. When you eat, your body redirects blood flow from around your body to your digestive system to help break down the food and absorb the nutrients. This is a normal physiological response to ensure proper digestion. However, some people may fear that engaging in physical activities, such as swimming after eating, might hinder blood flow for digestion, causing discomfort or even accidents. But, there’s no need to worry, as there’s no evidence indicating that exercise after eating, including swimming, would cause blood flow issues or other significant harm. In fact, light to moderate activities post-meal can actually aid digestion and promote overall health. Just be mindful of your body’s signals and refrain from overexerting yourself immediately after a heavy meal. Another concern when it comes to swimming after eating is the risk of experiencing muscle cramps. Muscle cramps can be painful and occur when your muscles involuntarily contract or spasm. Several factors can contribute to muscle cramps, such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and muscle fatigue. You might be thinking that swimming after eating might cause muscle cramps due to blood being diverted to the digestive system. However, there’s no concrete evidence to prove this notion. Muscle cramps during swimming are more likely a result of dehydration or overexertion, rather than digestion. To reduce the risk of cramps while swimming or engaging in other physical activities, consider the following tips: Listen to your body and use your best judgment when deciding to swim or engage in any physical activity after eating. Different types of food affect digestion and how quickly you’ll feel comfortable swimming after a meal. For example: To put things into practice, you might enjoy a light sandwich with lean protein like turkey or chicken, some whole-grain bread, and fresh veggies for an optimal pre-swim meal. Swimmers, especially athletes, could benefit from carbohydrate-rich snacks like bananas or energy bars before hitting the pool. The size of your meal also influences the time it takes to digest and how you feel while swimming. Larger meals require more time to break down and can lead to a feeling of fullness or even cramping during your swim. For ease and comfort, it’s best to have smaller, more frequent meals or snacks if you plan to swim regularly. Here is a guideline for how long to wait before swimming, based on meal size: Individual factors, such as metabolism, age, and swimming experience, can also affect digestion and how swimming feels post-meal. Children and seasoned athletes typically have faster metabolisms, allowing them to digest food more quickly and feel comfortable swimming sooner after a meal. On the other hand, those with slower metabolisms, such as older individuals or people with certain health conditions, may need to wait a bit longer after eating. The key is to listen to your body and learn what works best for you over time. Keep in mind that digestive behaviors can change, so stay aware of how you feel and adjust your pre-swim eating habits accordingly. When considering how long to wait before swimming after a meal, take the size of your meal into account. For light snacks or small meals, waiting around 30 minutes should be sufficient. However, for larger meals, it’s recommended to wait at least 1-1.5 hours before getting into the water. This allows your body enough time to begin digesting the food, minimizing the risk of discomfort or cramps while swimming. The type of swimming activity and the intensity at which you plan to swim also plays a role in determining how long to wait after eating. For example: While swimming on a full stomach doesn’t directly increase your risk of drowning, it can lead to certain issues such as nausea, cramps, or general discomfort. Here are some signs to watch out for: If you experience any of these symptoms while swimming, slow down, take a break, or get out of the water to give your body time to recover. Additionally, consuming alcohol before swimming can impair your judgment, coordination, and swimming abilities, potentially increasing the risk of drowning. Alcohol can also dehydrate you, increasing your risk of getting cramps. Do not drink alcohol prior to swimming. Eating before swimming might increase your risk of experiencing some discomfort, like stomach cramps, due to your muscles being used for digestion and swimming at the same time. However, the idea that it is extremely dangerous to eat before swimming is mostly a myth. Swimming short distances or at a slow pace is generally safe, even after a meal. Just listen to your body and be cautious of any discomfort or heavy breathing while swimming. As an adult, you can typically return to swimming after waiting about 30 minutes to an hour after eating. This allows your body to digest the food properly and prevent possible stomach cramps or regurgitation. Keep in mind that if you’ve had a particularly heavy meal, it could take up to 2 hours for your stomach to fully empty. If this is the case, waiting a bit longer before swimming would be advisable. In general, children should also wait about 30 minutes to an hour after eating before swimming. This gives them time to digest their meal and reduces the risk of experiencing any discomfort. However, each child is different, and some may need more or less time to digest food. As a parent or guardian, observe your child for any signs of discomfort after eating, and encourage them to take it slow and easy during their first few minutes in the water.

Make sure your fuel stores are primed while avoiding discomfort in the pool with James Collins’ top tips… Swimming provides a good workout for the whole body and is a great way to keep fit and healthy. As a competitive sport, training can involve a mixture of endurance and sprint training, depending on distance. Competition races can last anywhere between 20 seconds and 15 minutes, containing multiple heats over the course of the day. This places unique considerations on how swimmers should fuel the body for training. If you're going for a swim first thing, or have a training schedule that starts very early in the morning, fuelling your body for the task ahead can be a challenge. The horizontal body position in the pool, makes gastric influx more of an issue as well. It is therefore impractical to consume large amounts of food close to training, which otherwise may be more tolerable in cycling or running. If you are new to swimming, eating properly and at the right times can help you develop your strength and cardio fitness all the more quickly. If competing, fuelling for training is vital for optimal performance. The main fuel for exercise is carbohydrate, which is then stored in the muscles and liver as glycogen. The body is only able to store a relatively small amount of carbohydrate, which is why keeping it topped up is so important. As it is difficult to eat and effectively digest food during swimming, the emphasis is placed on eating before and after exercise to maintain energy stores, especially if swimming more than once a day. How long after eating a meal should I wait before going swimming? Everyone has different levels of comfort regarding eating around swimming, so it is important to trial what works for you. In general, allow 2-4 hours before your swim, following a larger meal to allow for digestion, and 30 minutes - two hours for a smaller snack. Consider the Glycaemic Index (GI) of carbohydrate - A food’s GI measures how quickly it is digested and broken down into glucose. Lower GI foods, give a slower release of energy and should be the focus of main meals during training. High GI foods are quickly broken down to glucose and thus are more readily available for energy. These make great options for quick snacks, before, during, or after training In general, main meals should include foods with low-GI carbohydrates and be moderate in protein and fats. Good options include:Prawn & pink grapefruit noodle saladBrown rice stir-fry with coriander omeletteSpicy root & lentil casserole​Jerk sweet potato & black bean currySmoked haddock with lemon & dill lentils Often work or other commitments will dictate when you can get to the pool, meaning that only a quick snack before your swim may be possible. For energy boosting snacks before a swim, try to focus on smaller, higher GI carbohydrates, which will be quickly absorbed and place less strain on the gut. Good options include:- 500ml bottle of commercially available isotonic sports drink- 1.5 carbohydrate energy gels- Small handful of jellied sweets- 1 large banana- 1 large cereal bar or carbohydrate based energy bar (low fibre) Should I eat before an early morning swim and if so, what should I opt for? You should eat where possible before your morning swim; especially if it's a longer (one hour in duration) or a high-intensity session. The body uses carbohydrate stores for high-intensity work, and if training on an empty stomach you might find you tire quickly. Many recreational and competitive swimmers find eating before swimming difficult, due to experiencing symptoms of reflux or even nausea in the pool. Here are two morning situations to plan for: The early riser - if you wake up two hours before your swim, good options include:Apple & linseed porridgeAmerican blueberry pancakesHoney muesli with raspberries & hazelnutsSmoked salmon & pea frittataBanana yogurt pots Straight out of bed - if you prefer to get straight down to the pool, the energy-boosting snacks listed in question 1 would be good options. If you can’t tolerate any food before your swim, or prefer not to eat, try increasing the carbohydrate portion of your evening meal the night before, as this will be stored in the muscles (as glycogen) ready for your morning swim. What should I definitely avoid eating before a swim? To provide sufficient fuel, foods should be predominantly high in carbohydrate. Swimmers should also use foods they are used to, make them feel comfortable, and don’t cause any gastrointestinal symptoms. In the 2-4 hours before, swimmers should try to limit the following, as these are well known causes of gastrointestinal distress (diarrhoea, bowel upsets): Excess fibre, excess fatty foods, unusually spicy foods, excess caffeine intakes, and more obviously, alcohol. In the hour before a swim, snacks should focus on smaller, easily absorbed, high GI snacks and contain limited amounts of fibre.Now you know what to eat before your swim, get the rest of your training nutrition right: What to eat during your swimWhat to eat after your swimWhat to eat before your runWhat to eat during your runWhat to eat after your run Are you training for an event this year?

Earth Future Planet Health Gap Sustainability on a Shoestring Time: The Ultimate Guide The Next Giant Leap Green Tech Best of BBC Future Latest More I can still remember how slowly time seemed to pass as a child when I was on the beach, and had to wait an hour after I’d finished my sandwiches before I was allowed back into the sea. The reason, I was always told, was that swimming on a full stomach is dangerous because you might get cramp or a stitch, leaving you unable to swim, and this could result in drowning. But is there any truth in it? The causes of are cramp still aren’t fully understood, as I’ve discussed previously. There’s no evidence to suggest that exercising after eating gives you cramp, but what we do know is that vigorous exercise directs blood flow away from the digestive area to the skin and to the muscles in your arms, legs and skin. So, if your food is still half-digested this could make you nauseous. It’s the same reason that extreme fear makes you feel sick. The fight-or-flight response abandons less-urgent processes like digestion, diverting blood flow to the muscles so that you can defend yourself physically, or run faster than you ever have before. But these studies on cramp involved athletes taking part in long-distance running or even triathlons – involving a lot more vigour and endurance than the kinds of splashing about kids are more likely to do on holiday. Professional swimmers are careful not to race on a full stomach, but they do ensure that they have eaten enough to provide the fuel needed for them to perform at their best. When endurance swimmers undertake very long distances they even consume food during the race. If they do experience cramp, it’s more a result of overexertion, it doesn’t seem to be related to food. So how about a stitch? Although this can feel like cramp, researchers differentiate between the two. Despite having been given the medical name of “exercise-related transient abdominal pain”, stitches are still not fully understood. In Australia sports scientist Darren Morton has devoted his research career to the subject of the stitch. He’s found that elite swimmers are even more prone to getting a stitch than runners. People who had eaten a large meal between one and two hours before a race were more likely to get a stitch, even though they had waited the requisite hour before exercise. (He does have one bit of good news, though – the older you get, the rarer they become.) Data dip But there is one theory that could explain exercise-related stitches. Morton noticed that many long-distance runners found they got a stitch in a race not long after visiting a drinks station to rehydrate. He decided to do an experiment, in which people were required to drink far larger amounts of fluid than usual just before they exercised. Those who drank reconstituted fruit juice were more likely to feel bloated and to get a stitch. He speculates that the juice bloats the stomach, putting pressure on the parietal peritoneum, the outer layer of the abdominal wall. This is an area that is particularly sensitive, which could explain the pain of a stitch. If a bloated stomach can irritate the area and cause a stitch, then in principle food could do the same. Back to the water, if you do succumb to a stitch or to cramp, is there any evidence that it would cause you to drown? If a child is in shallow water they can stand up. It’s even possible to float on your back with a stitch. A child would only be in danger if they were in deep water, far from anything to grab onto, without being good enough at swimming to float – a situation which is inadvisable, whether you’ve just eaten or not. If you look at the statistics, many children do die of drowning worldwide every year. In China it’s the leading cause of accidental death in children. However, eating does not feature as a contributory factor. The US Centers for Disease Control, for instance, lists the main risks as the inability to swim, the lack of fencing around pools, lack of supervision. In adults, another major cause is drinking alcohol before swimming. Regardless, there are other good reasons not to encourage swimming straight after lunch – avoiding feeling sick and staying out of the sun while it’s at its hottest in the early afternoon, for example. So telling kids they might drown because they’ve just eaten is one way of getting them to listen to you. But from the evidence, it doesn’t appear to be backed up by science.

Although blood is sent to your stomach after you eat, there’s no evidence that this makes swimming after eating dangerous. However, you shouldn’t consume alcohol before water activities. You might have heard that you should wait 30 to 60 minutes after a meal to go swimming. But where exactly did this idea come from? And is it true? While your parents may have given many reasons why swimming on a full stomach is a big no-no, the evidence that there’s danger in hopping back into the pool immediately after lunch is scarce. Yes. Swimming after eating should be fine, as long as your body feels comfortable and the swimming is recreational — as in, just for fun. There is no evidence that swimming after eating poses a health risk. You can feel free to have lunch by the pool and then immediately hop in the water to cool off. If you are going to be doing something more vigorous, such as swimming laps or competing in a swim meet, you might want to leave some space in between eating and your activity. This is because eating too soon before any intense exercise can cause gastrointestinal upset. However, it is not dangerous or life-threatening. In a 1961 research bulletin, exercise physiologist Arthur Steinhaus wrote that it was surprising that the no swimming after eating rule had been around for so long because there was no scientific evidence to support it. In a 1968 study, 24 swimmers were fed a carb-heavy breakfast of cereal, toast, sugar, butter, and whole milk and were instructed to wait for varying periods of time before swimming laps. None of the swimmers reported any negative effects, no matter how long they waited to swim after breakfast. More recently, a review of research published by the American Red Cross in 2011 found that there was no danger posed by swimming after eating. It’s not clear where or when the idea originated, but it has been around for at least a century. In her 1918 book, “How to Swim,” author Annette Kellermann advised readers to wait at least 2 hours after eating before getting in the water to allow for proper digestion. After a big meal, blood flow is diverted away from your working muscles and into your stomach to help with the digestion process. During exercise, however, blood flow shifts away from your stomach toward your working muscles and lungs. The thought seemed to be that if your blood was sent toward your stomach, there wouldn’t be enough left for your muscles, leaving them oxygen-deprived and potentially causing you to cramp up and drown. But the truth is, we have enough blood to keep all our body parts functioning after a big meal. While there’s little evidence to suggest much risk in swimming after eating, swimming after drinking alcohol is a real danger. Alcohol use is involved in up to 70% of deaths associated with water recreation among adolescents and adults, according to the CDC. Alcohol can decrease your coordination, balance, and judgment, and it increases risk-taking behavior. For these reasons, alcohol and water activities should not be mixed. The body needs food as fuel to perform during exercise. But eating the wrong food or eating at the wrong time can affect the body’s ability to function at its best. Eating too close to exercise, or eating heavy foods that are hard for the body to digest, could lead to gastrointestinal discomfort during your workout. As a rule of thumb, you should wait 3 to 4 hours to exercise after a large meal, 1 to 2 hours after a small meal, and 30 to 60 minutes after a light snack. If you’re having a meal before a workout, the American Heart Association suggests that you: Eat complex carbohydrates. Whole grains are a great choice, as are beans and brown rice. Avoid fatty and slowly digested foods. Saturated fats, such as those found in butter, cheese, and red meat, should be limited. So should large amounts of protein, as they take awhile for your stomach to digest. Drink water. There are no exact rules for how much, but the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends 17 to 20 ounces (a little over 2 cups). If you’re hungry and you need to eat something just before your workout, reach for a piece of fruit. There is no evidence that you need to wait to enter the water after you eat. If you’re going to swim laps or swim competitively, however, you may want to wait a little while to let your food digest. Eating too close to any type of vigorous activity could cause digestive upset. But it’s still not dangerous. American Heart Association. (2015). Food as fuel before, during and after workouts.

{"question": "What happens if you swallow gum?", "answer": "If you swallow gum, it will pass through your digestive system", "mgt": "If a person swallows gum, it usually passes through the digestive system without any major issues. Here's a detailed explanation of what typically happens:\n\n1. Ingestion: When you chew gum, it's broken down into smaller pieces and mixed with saliva, which helps to wet and soften it.\n\n2. swallowing: Swallowing the gum is a normal part of the swallowing process. The gum, along with the saliva, is gently pushed down the esophagus, a muscular tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.\n\n3. stomach: In the stomach, the gum, being a soft, sticky substance, doesn't break down like solid food. It gets mixed with stomach acids and digestive enzymes but doesn't cause any harm.\n\n4. intestines: The gum continues to move through the intestines, where it is slowly broken down by stomach enzymes and microorganisms in the gut. The majority of the gum will be eliminated in the feces, along with indigestible material.\n\n5. Time: It usually takes about 24-48 hours for the swallowed gum to pass through the digestive system, depending on the amount ingested.\n\n6. Potential concerns: Some people might be concerned about gum getting stuck in the digestive system, but this is rare. Since the gum is not broken down to a point where it can become stuck, it eventually moves out without causing any blockages.\n\nIn summary, swallowing gum is generally harmless and does not require special attention. However, excessive swallowing (e.g., in a person with swallowing disorders) could lead to discomfort or problems. If you or someone you know has concerns about swallowing gum, it's best to consult a healthcare professional for guidance.", "token_usage": 344, "human_written_evidences": ["If you swallow gum, it will pass through your digestive system; If you swallow gum, nothing will happen to you; If you swallow gum, it will be excreted; If you swallow gum, it will not be digested; If you swallow gum, it may cause an intestinal blockage; If you swallow gum, it won't harm you; If you swallow gum, it will pass through your digestive system instead of staying there for seven years"], "reference_documents": [], "model_retrieved_documents": ["What happens if you swallow gum? Although it’s not recommended, if you accidently swallow a piece of gum you’re chewing, you have little to worry about. Your body can’t digest gum, but a piece of swallowed gum will usually pass through your digestive system — basically intact — and come out in your stool about 40 hours later, just like almost everything else you eat. If you swallow large quantities of gum in a short period of time, however, it could potentially cause a block in your intestines. If you swallow a piece of gum, there’s probably no reason to see a doctor. It should pass normally through your digestive tract. If you swallow a large amount of gum or if you swallow gum with other indigestible objects, that might cause a blockage. This could require surgery to remove it from your digestive tract. The symptoms of a blockage typically include abdominal pain and constipation, sometimes accompanied by vomiting. If you think you have an intestinal blockage, see your doctor. Prior to World War II, gum was made with chicle — the sap from the Central American sapodilla tree — with added flavorings. The majority of gum today is made of gum base. This is a combination of polymers, plasticizers, and resins. It’s usually mixed with food-grade softeners, preservatives, sweeteners, colors, and flavorings. Often, gum has a powdered or hard polyol coating. The exact ingredients and measurements of ingredients in gum bases are the intellectual property “trade secrets” of gum manufacturers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines chewing gum as a “food of minimal nutritional value.” This means it can’t be sold in competition with school breakfast and lunch programs. Other foods in this category include soda and some candies. This definition of gum is somewhat controversial because many of the ingredients in gum bases are inedible products used in nonfood items such as caulking, white glue, and plastic bags. It’s generally safe to chew gum although many believe the sugar or sugar substitutes in gum aren’t healthy for children. Aside from this, you shouldn’t allow children to chew gum until they can fully understand that they shouldn’t swallow it after chewing. Although a swallowed piece of gum should pass through a child just as it would an adult, young children might swallow large quantities of gum and even objects that can get stuck to the gum in their digestive tract. If you swallow a piece of gum, don’t be concerned. It shouldn’t cause you any problems. If you or your child have swallowed a large quantity of gum in a short time, you should see your doctor to check for an intestinal blockage.

{"question": "What are the benefits of eating an apple a day?", "answer": "Apples are nutritious", "mgt": "There are several potential benefits to eating an apple a day, based on scientific research and general health recommendations. Here are some key advantages:\n\n1. **Fruits as a part of a balanced diet**: Apples are a good source of fiber, which is essential for maintaining digestive health. They contribute to regularity and can help lower cholesterol levels and prevent constipation.\n\n2. **Weight management**: Apples are relatively low in calories and high in fiber, which can contribute to feelings of fullness and aid in weight control. The fiber also slows down digestion, preventing blood sugar spikes and helping to maintain a stable energy level.\n\n3. **Heart health**: Apples contain flavonoids, particularly anthocyanins, that have been linked to cardiovascular health. These compounds have antioxidant properties and may help reduce the risk of heart disease.\n\n4. **Nutrient-dense**: Apples provide various vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C (for immune system boost), potassium (for blood pressure regulation), and a small amount of boron (important for bone health).\n\n5. **Chewable snack**: Eating an apple can be a simple and convenient snack that requires minimal preparation, promoting healthy snacking habits.\n\n6. **Prebiotics**: Some apples have a high content of prebiotics, which are indigestible carbohydrates that act as food for gut microbiota. This can promote a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut, which can contribute to overall gut health.\n\n7. **Satiety**: The combination of fiber and water content in apples can help you feel full for longer, reducing the likelihood of overeating at other meals.\n\nIt's important to note that while eating an apple a day can be beneficial, a balanced diet that includes a variety of whole fruits, vegetables, and other nutrient-dense foods is crucial for optimal health.

Apples may lower your chance of developing cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Research says apples may also help you lose weight while improving your gut and brain health. Apples are the most widely consumed fruit globally. From sweet red varieties, like Red Delicious, Fuji, or Gala, to tangy green ones, like Granny Smith — my favorite with lime juice and a little salt when I want a savory snack — there is an apple for everyone. They’re commonly used in recipes like pies, cookies, muffins, jam, salads, oatmeal, or smoothies. They also make a great snack or wedged and smeared with nut butter. In addition to their culinary versatility and numerous colors and flavors, apples are an exceptionally healthy fruit with many research-backed benefits. Here are eight impressive health benefits of apples. Apples are considered nutrient-dense fruits, meaning they provide a lot of nutrients per serving. The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend 2 cups of fruit daily for a 2,000-calorie diet, emphasizing whole fruits like apples. One medium 7-ounce (oz) or 200 grams (g) apple offers the following nutrients: The same serving also provides 2–5% of the DV for vitamins E, B1, and B6. Apples are also a rich source of polyphenols, an important group of antioxidants. While nutrition labels don’t list these plant compounds, they’re likely responsible for many of apples’ health benefits. To get the most out of apples, leave the skin on, as it contains half of the fiber and most of the polyphenols. Apples are a good source of fiber and vitamin C. They also contain antioxidants, like vitamin E, and polyphenols, contributing to the fruit’s numerous health benefits. Apples are high in fiber and water, which makes them filling. In one study, eating whole apples increased fullness more than consuming equal amounts of apple juice. This may happen because whole apples reduce gastric emptying — the rate at which your stomach empties. Research also suggests apple intake may significantly reduce Body Mass Index (BMI), a weight-related risk factor for heart disease. Interestingly, apple polyphenols may also have anti-obesity effects. Apples are particularly filling due to their high fiber and water content. Their polyphenols may also have anti-obesity effects. Apples have been linked to a lower chance of heart disease. Research has found that eating 100-150 g/d of whole apples is associated with a lower chance of heart disease and risk factors such as high blood pressure. One reason may be that they contain soluble fiber. This fiber is also associated with a lower chance of heart disease. Another reason may be that they offer polyphenols. Some of these may help lower blood pressure. Studies have also linked high intakes of flavonoids with a lower chance of stroke. Another study has also linked eating apples to a reduced chance of stroke. Apples promote heart health in several ways. They’re high in soluble fiber, which helps lower cholesterol. They also have polyphenols linked to lower blood pressure and chance of stroke. Eating apples may also reduce your chance of type 2 diabetes. A compilation of studies found that eating apples and pears was associated with an 18% reduction in type 2 diabetes risk. Just one serving per week may reduce the risk by 3%. The high amount of the polyphenol quercetin in apples could explain this beneficial effect. Eating apples is linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, potentially due to their polyphenol content. Apples contain pectin, a type of fiber that acts as a prebiotic in your gut microbiome, and a healthy gut is often key to better health. Since dietary fiber cannot be digested, pectin reaches your colon intact, promoting the growth of good bacteria. It especially improves the ratio of Bacteriodetes to Firmicutes, the two main types of bacteria in your gut. New research suggests that, by beneficially altering your gut microbiota, apples may help protect against chronic diseases like obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. The type of fiber found in apples improves your gut-friendly bacteria, which may be why the fruit is thought to help protect against chronic diseases. Antioxidants in apples may offer beneficial effects against certain types of cancers, including lung, breast, and digestive tract cancers. Research suggests these effects may be attributed to apple polyphenols keeping cancerous cells from multiplying. Moreover, one study in women reported that higher apple intakes were linked to a lower chance of cancer death. However, further human research is needed to better understand the possible link between apples and cancer prevention — for example, to identify adequate amounts and eating timing. Apple’s fiber and antioxidant content has been linked to a reduced chance of getting certain types of cancer. However, more research on humans is needed. Antioxidant-rich apples may help reduce airway inflammation related to allergic asthma. Apple skin is rich in the antioxidant quercetin, which can help regulate your immune system and reduce inflammation. Theoretically, this could make apples effective against late phases of bronchial asthma responses. Supporting this, test-tube and animal studies suggest quercetin may be suitable for allergic inflammatory diseases like asthma and sinusitis. Still, more human research is needed on the topic. Apples contain antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds that may help regulate immune responses and protect against asthma. However, more research, especially in humans, is needed. Quercetin in apples may protect your brain from damage caused by oxidative stress. A meta-analysis of 14 animal studies suggests quercetin may have some preventive properties against Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Still, the researchers questioned some of the study methodologies and believed more research is needed to conclude. Remember that most research focuses on a specific compound instead of whole apples. Therefore, further research is still needed, specifically on the effects of apples, before any conclusions can be drawn. Quercetin in apples may protect your brain against oxidative stress. However, further research is needed to validate the effect of eating the whole fruit. Eating more vegetables and fruit like apples may help your mental health, according to one 2020 systematic review. That said, the study found this benefit kicks in if you eat at least 5 servings of fruit and vegetables daily, consistent with the recommendations of the American Dietary Guidelines for daily fruit and vegetable intake. In addition, a 2022 British study found that adolescents who consume fewer vegetables and fruit in their diet tend to have poorer mental health. Research suggests that eating fruit like apples may help reduce the chance of getting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Multiple studies have also suggested that eating apples can help your food digest better, which may be helpful with constipation. But the extent of the effect may depend on the type of apple you’re eating. Apples are an incredibly nutritious fruit that offers multiple health benefits, so eating at least one apple daily will certainly benefit your health. There isn’t a specific number of apples that are best to eat daily. The American Guidelines for Nutrition recommend about five servings of fruit and vegetables a day, split evenly between fruit and vegetables. One study on apples specifically did find that people who eat at least one apple daily seem to require fewer prescription medications. That said, more research is needed to investigate this. They’re rich in fiber and antioxidants. Eating them is linked to a lower chance of getting many chronic conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Apples may also promote weight loss and improve gut and brain health. Even though more research is needed to better understand how apples affect human health, you can’t go wrong with this tasty, versatile, and easily accessible fruit.

Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy “Apples are popular for a reason,” says registered dietitian Amber Sommer, RD, LD. “They’re easy to eat on the go, and they taste terrific. But what most people don’t know is that eating them regularly over time can provide a big health boost.” Sommer shares the benefits of apples and why you should grab a bushel at the market. Apples are only about 60 calories each, giving you a lot of nutritional bang for the calorie count. You get the most health benefits of apples when you eat them whole, raw and unpeeled. Juice, cider and applesauce aren’t as healthy because cooking and processing apples remove valuable nutrients. Apples’ nutrients vary a bit, depending on the type you eat. Red Delicious apples may be the healthiest variety of apple. Its dark, red skin contains more antioxidants (substances that protect cells from damage). But all apples are loaded with nutrients, including: The combination of antioxidants and fiber makes apples a nutritional powerhouse. Here are some of the ways eating apples benefits your health: “When you eat sugary, processed foods like doughnuts, the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood spikes,” says Sommer. “But when you eat foods that are high in fiber and lower in sugar, like apples, it keeps your glucose levels steady.” High glucose levels over time can lead to Type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition that affects more than 33 million Americans. Good news for apple fans, though: A study of more than 38,000 people found that those who ate more than one apple a day were 28% less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than those who didn’t eat any apples. The benefits likely come from both antioxidants and fiber in apples: Having high cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease because it clogs your arteries, restricting blood flow to your heart. But the antioxidants and fiber in apples are a winning combo to help lower that number. The type of fiber that stands out here is pectin, which binds to cholesterol in your digestive tract and flushes it out. Multiple studies in people with high cholesterol show that consuming a few apples a day can reduce total cholesterol levels by about 5% to 8%. Can’t down that many apples in 24 hours? Try a daily serving of 3 ounces of dried apples (no sugar added). One study’s participants reduced their total cholesterol by 13% in six months after eating that much. When you have high blood pressure, the force of blood flowing through your blood vessels can damage them. It’s a leading contributor to stroke and heart attacks. A healthy diet is one way to prevent and manage high blood pressure. A small Australian study found eating apples helped lower blood pressure. Other research has had mixed results. But researchers agree that antioxidants in apple peels help your blood flow smoothly. The fiber in apples may also play a role. Inflammation is one way our bodies fight infections and heal damaged tissue. But inflammation should only last a short time. Continual, longstanding (chronic) inflammation actually causes damage and can lead to disease. Apples contain anti-inflammatory substances — mainly fiber and quercetin, an antioxidant that reduces inflammation, especially in your respiratory system. According to multiple studies, eating apples lowers c-reactive proteins in your blood, a sign that chronic inflammation is improving. Additionally, a study of 1,600 young adults suggests that eating apples and pears may protect against developing asthma. Other research also points to improved lung function in people who eat apples. Your body is a wonderland for many microorganisms that live in your gut and on your skin. Some are helpful, while some are harmful. Apples help with both types: “Because apples are high in water and fiber, they make a filling snack,” says Sommer. “The fiber helps slow digestion, so you feel full for longer.” And as apples are low in calories, choosing a healthy snack like apples over higher-calorie snacks such as cookies or candy, can help you maintain a healthy weight. If you eat an apple a day, you might just live longer, says one study. Researchers discovered that participants who did this were 35% less likely to die when they followed up 15 years later. Adding apples to your diet can reduce your risk of heart disease or cancer, the top two leading causes of death in the United States. In a study of nearly 40,000 people, those who ate apples were 13% to 22% less likely to develop heart disease than those who skipped the fruit. Apples may also help prevent cancer. Research indicates that those who eat apples are less likely to get the disease. But how many apples do you need to eat to lower your risk? One big study of 77,000 people found that those who ate at least one apple a day had a lower risk of lung cancer. Apples are found in nearly every supermarket and farmer’s market. You can toss them into lunchboxes, pack them for a picnic and add them to charcuterie boards. They may not be as fancy-looking or prized as berries, grapes or kiwis — but they’re less expensive and easier to find. And who knew that the humble apple had so many amazing health benefits? It can extend your years and protect against chronic diseases that can take a toll on daily life. Eat them whole or have fun with fresh, creative apple recipes. Try adding them to oatmeal or tossing some onto a salad to give it an extra nutritional boost. “Apples have definitely earned a place in a healthy diet,” Sommer states. “It’s a fruit that can impact your health in such positive ways.” Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Look no further than the delicious apple!", "", "Dr Michael Mosley explores the benefits of eating apples. The popular phrase “an apple a day…” has its roots in an old Welsh saying that first appeared in print back in 1866. Originally it was “Eat an apple on going to bed and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread!” Well, it turns out there might be some merit in the saying. Eating apples regularly is linked to a reduced risk of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. They're packed full of goodies – fibre, vitamins and important chemical compounds called flavonoids. Flavonoids are concentrated in the skin of apples. They're produced by plants to protect them from stress, sunlight and disease. Amazingly, by eating these plants, you can acquire similar protective effects! One of the ways that scientists think flavonoids can have a beneficial effect on our bodies is by increasing the production of an amazing molecule called nitric oxide. It can regulate blood pressure, maintain blood vessel health, and have a number of beneficial effects on your body. In Just One Thing, Dr Catherine Bondonno from Edith Cowan University in Western Australia discusses her research into apples. Her work has revealed that eating apples – specifically with the skin on, where the flavonoids are concentrated – could help reduce blood pressure and improve blood vessel health within a few hours of intake. Researchers from the University of Reading have also demonstrated that eating apples daily could have an impact on cholesterol levels. They asked participants with slightly high blood cholesterol to eat two apples every day for eight weeks and found that this helped lower their cholesterol to healthier levels. Drinking the juice did not have the same effect. You should eat the whole apple for the most benefit: our bodies need both the flavonoids in the skin and the fibre in the flesh – and here’s why… Eating the whole apple can change how your gut digests the flavonoids! The fibre decreases the absorption of flavonoids in the small intestine and “increases the amount that reaches the large intestine, where they are broken down by the gut bacteria there,” Dr Bondonno says. Furthermore, both flavonoids and fibre can increase the quantity of good bacteria and decrease the quantity of harmful bacteria in the gut! It’s literally good bacteria food. A fibre called pectin in apples, for example, acts like a “prebiotic”. It helps nourish the good health-promoting bacteria in your gut, such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. These helpful bacteria can reduce inflammation and help fight off harmful organisms that might cause disease. And flavonoids can lead to the production of short-chain fatty acids which are thought to be beneficial for healthy microbial populations. Eating apples has a wide range of lasting impacts on the body, all of which can have a significant impact on your long-term health. A study by Dr Bondonno following over 1,400 women in Australia over 15 years found that having one apple a day was linked to a lower risk of dying – by a huge 35%. The results are incredible – extend your life, just with an apple a day! A simple apple can improve your gut, help your heart, and even improve blood flow in your brain to keep it healthy. Deep purple apples have that colour because of the anthocyanins content. But not all flavonoids have a colour, so it’s difficult to tell an apple’s flavonoid content just by colour. Pink or yellow apples can also be high in flavonoids. Studies have found that the most popular apples with the highest amounts of flavonoids include the Pink Lady and the Golden Delicious. The good news is that cooking your apples won’t diminish the beneficial flavonoid content, because flavonoids are relatively stable compounds. So whether you’re enjoying a raw apple as a midday snack, or having a few baked into a crumble – leave the skin on and enjoy the benefits that apples will give you for your gut, your blood vessels, cholesterol levels and your brain.
