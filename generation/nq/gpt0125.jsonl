The Dodgers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West division. Established in 1883 in the city of Brooklyn, which in 1898 became a borough of New York City, the team joined the NL in 1890 as the Brooklyn Bridegrooms and assumed several other monikers before finally settling on the name Dodgers in 1932.[5][6][7] From the 1940s through the mid-1950s, the Dodgers developed a fierce crosstown rivalry with the New York Yankees as the two clubs faced each other in the World Series seven times, with the Dodgers losing the first five matchups before defeating them to win the franchise's first title in 1955. It was also during this period that the Dodgers made history by breaking the baseball color line in 1947 with the debut of Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play in the Major Leagues since 1884.[8] Another major milestone was reached in 1956 when Don Newcombe became the first player ever to win both the Cy Young Award and the NL MVP in the same season.[9] After 68 seasons in Brooklyn, Dodgers owner and president Walter O'Malley relocated the franchise to Los Angeles before the 1958 season.[10] The team played their first four seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving to their current home of Dodger Stadium in 1962.[11] The Dodgers found immediate success in Los Angeles by winning the 1959 World Series, representing the franchise's first championship since moving to Los Angeles. Success continued into the 1960s with their one-two punch ace pitchers Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale being the cornerstones of two more titles in 1963 and 1965. During the 1980s, Mexican phenom pitcher Fernando Valenzuela quickly became a sensation—affectionately referred to as \"Fernandomania\"—when he led the team as a rookie to another championship in 1981. Valenzuela became the first and, to date, the only player to ever win the Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards in the same season.[12] The Dodgers were once again victorious in 1988, upsetting their heavily favored opponent in each series and becoming the first and only franchise to win multiple titles in the 1980s.[13] After a 32-year drought, which included 12 postseason appearances in a 17-year span and eight consecutive division titles from 2013 to 2020, the Dodgers won the 2020 World Series.[14] One of the most successful and storied franchises in MLB, the Dodgers have won seven World Series championships and a record 24 National League pennants. Eleven NL MVP award winners have played for the Dodgers, winning a total of 14. Eight Cy Young Award winners have pitched for the club, winning a total of 12—by far the most of any Major League franchise. Additionally, the Dodgers boast 18 Rookie of the Year Award winners—twice as many as the next club. This includes four consecutive Rookies of the Year from 1979 to 1982 and five consecutive from 1992 to 1996. From 1884 through 2022, the Dodgers' all-time record is 11,234–9,942 (.531).[15] Today, the Dodgers are among the most popular MLB teams, enjoying large fan support both at home and on the road;[16][17][18] they are widely seen as the most dominant team in the National League in the present day.[19][20] They maintain a fierce rivalry with the San Francisco Giants dating back to when the two clubs were based in New York City, as well as a more recent rivalry with the American League's Houston Astros due to their role as the victims of the Astros' sign stealing scandal in the 2017 World Series. As of 2022, Forbes ranks the Dodgers second in MLB franchise valuation at $4.075 billion.[21] Although the team had no official nickname until 1932, they were informally nicknamed the Bridegrooms in the team's earliest years, then the Superbas around the turn of the century and then the Robins (named after manager Wilbert Robinson). In the early 1900s, sportswriter Charles Dryden nicknamed the team the Trolley Dodgers after the Brooklyn pedestrians who dodged streetcars in the city, and the Dodgers nickname was used contemporaneously with Superbas and Robins. In 1932, the team allowed the Brooklyn baseball writers to select a permanent name, and the writers chose Dodgers on January 22, 1932. The only other nickname seriously considered by the writers was Kings.[22][23] In 1941, the Dodgers captured their third National League pennant, only to lose to the New York Yankees. This marked the onset of the Dodgers–Yankees rivalry, as the Dodgers would face them in their next six World Series appearances. Led by Jackie Robinson, the first black Major League Baseball player of the modern era; and three-time National League Most Valuable Player Roy Campanella, also signed out of the Negro leagues, the Dodgers captured their first World Series title in 1955 by defeating the Yankees for the first time, a story notably described in the 1972 book The Boys of Summer. Following the 1957 season the team left Brooklyn. In just their second season in Los Angeles, the Dodgers won their second World Series title, beating the Chicago White Sox in six games in 1959. Spearheaded by the dominant pitching style of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, the Dodgers captured three pennants in the 1960s and won two more World Series titles, sweeping the Yankees in four games in 1963, and edging the Minnesota Twins in seven in 1965. The 1963 sweep was their second victory against the Yankees, and their first against them as a Los Angeles team. The Dodgers won four more pennants in 1966, 1974, 1977 and 1978, but lost in each World Series appearance. They went on to win the World Series again in 1981, thanks in part to pitching sensation Fernando Valenzuela. The early 1980s were affectionately dubbed \"Fernandomania\". In 1988, another pitching hero, Orel Hershiser, again led them to a World Series victory, aided by one of the most memorable home runs of all time by their star outfielder Kirk Gibson coming off the bench, despite having injuries to both knees, to pinch-hit with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of game 1, in his only appearance of the series. The Dodgers won the pennant in 2017 for the first time since their world series victory in 1988, aided by a Justin Turner walk-off home run on the same night of Gibson's iconic walk-off home run 29 years earlier. They went on to face the Houston Astros and lose in 7 games; however, the series became embroiled in controversy due to the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal. The Dodgers won the pennant in 2018 for a second year in a row, moving on to lose to the Boston Red Sox in 5 games. They went on to win the World Series again in 2020 by defeating the Tampa Bay Rays in 6 games, after playing a season shortened to 60 games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Dodgers share a fierce rivalry with the San Francisco Giants, dating back to when the two franchises played in New York City. Both teams moved west for the 1958 season.[24] The Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers have appeared in the World Series 21 times, while the New York/San Francisco Giants have appeared in the World Series 20 times. The Giants have won one more World Series (8); when the two teams were based in New York, the Giants won five World Series championships, and the Dodgers one. After the move to California, the Dodgers have won six World Series while the Giants have won three. In Brooklyn, the Dodgers won the NL pennant twelve times (1890, 1899, 1900, 1916, 1920, 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956) and the World Series in 1955. After moving to Los Angeles, the team won National League pennants in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1974, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1988, 2017, 2018 and 2020, with World Series championships in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1981, 1988 and 2020. In all, the Dodgers have appeared in 21 World Series: nine in Brooklyn and twelve in Los Angeles. The Dodgers were founded in 1883 as the Brooklyn Atlantics, borrowing the name of a defunct team that had played in Brooklyn before them. The team joined the American Association in 1884 and won the AA championship in 1889 before joining the National League in 1890. They promptly won the NL Championship their first year in the League. The team was known alternatively as the Bridegrooms, Grooms, Superbas, Robins and Trolley Dodgers, before officially becoming the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1930s. For most of the first half of the 20th century, no Major League Baseball team employed an African American player. Jackie Robinson became the first African American to play for a Major League Baseball team when he played his first major league game on April 15, 1947, as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers.[25] This was mainly due to general manager Branch Rickey's efforts. The deeply religious Rickey's motivation appears to have been primarily moral, although business considerations were also a factor. Rickey was a member of The Methodist Church, the antecedent denomination to The United Methodist Church of today, which was a strong advocate for social justice and active later in the American Civil Rights Movement.[26] This event was the harbinger of the integration of professional sports in the United States, the concomitant demise of the Negro leagues, and is regarded as a key moment in the history of the American Civil Rights Movement. Robinson was an exceptional player, a speedy runner who sparked the team with his intensity. He was the inaugural recipient of the Rookie of the Year award, which is now named the Jackie Robinson Award in his honor. The Dodgers' willingness to integrate, when most other teams refused to, was a key factor in their 1947–1956 success. They won six pennants in those 10 years with the help of Robinson, three-time MVP Roy Campanella, Cy Young Award winner Don Newcombe, Jim Gilliam and Joe Black. Robinson would eventually go on to become the first African-American elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. Real estate investor Walter O'Malley acquired majority ownership of the Dodgers in 1950, when he bought the 25 percent share of co-owner Branch Rickey and became allied with the widow of another equal partner, Mrs. John L. Smith. Shortly afterwards, he was working to buy new land in Brooklyn to build a more accessible and profitable ballpark than the aging Ebbets Field. Beloved as it was, Ebbets Field was no longer well-served by its aging infrastructure and the Dodgers could no longer sell out the park even in the heat of a pennant race, despite largely dominating the National League from 1946 to 1957. O'Malley wanted to build a new, state-of-the-art stadium in Brooklyn. But City Planner Robert Moses and New York politicians refused to grant him the eminent domain authority required to build pursuant to O'Malley's plans. To put pressure on the city, during the 1955 season, O'Malley announced that the team would play seven regular-season games and one exhibition game at Jersey City's Roosevelt Stadium in 1956.[27] Moses and the City considered this an empty threat, and did not believe O'Malley would go through with moving the team from New York City. After teams began to travel to and from games by air instead of train, it became possible to include locations in the far west. Los Angeles officials attended the 1956 World Series looking to the Washington Senators to move to the West Coast. When O'Malley heard that LA was looking for a club, he sent word to the Los Angeles officials that he was interested in talking. LA offered him what New York would not: a chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark, and own that ballpark, giving him complete control over all revenue streams. When the news came out, NYC Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. and Moses made an offer to build a ballpark on the World's Fair Grounds in Queens that would be shared by the Giants and Dodgers. However, O'Malley was interested in his park under only his conditions, and the plans for a new stadium in Brooklyn seemed like a pipe dream. O'Malley decided to move the Dodgers to California, convincing Giants owner Horace Stoneham to move to San Francisco instead of Minneapolis to keep the Giants-Dodgers rivalry alive on the West Coast.[27] The Dodgers played their final game at Ebbets Field on September 24, 1957, which the Dodgers won 2–0 over the Pittsburgh Pirates. New York remained a one-team town with the New York Yankees until 1962, when Joan Payson founded the New York Mets and brought National League baseball back to the city. The blue background used by the Dodgers was adopted by the Mets, honoring their New York NL forebears with a blend of Dodgers blue and Giants orange.[28] The Dodgers were the first Major League Baseball team to ever play in Los Angeles. On April 18, 1958, the Dodgers played their first LA game, defeating the former New York and now new San Francisco Giants, 6–5, before 78,672 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Catcher Roy Campanella, left partially paralyzed in an off-season accident, was never able to play in Los Angeles. Construction on Dodger Stadium was completed in time for Opening Day 1962. With its clean, simple lines and its picturesque setting amid hills and palm trees, the ballpark quickly became an icon of the Dodgers and their new California lifestyle. O'Malley was determined that there would not be a bad seat in the house, achieving this by cantilevered grandstands that have since been widely imitated. More importantly for the team, the stadium's spacious dimensions, along with other factors, gave defense an advantage over offense and the Dodgers moved to take advantage of this by assembling a team that would excel with its pitching. Since moving to Los Angeles, the Dodgers have won twelve more National League Championships and six more World Series rings.[29] The Dodgers' official history reports that the term \"Trolley Dodgers\" was attached to the Brooklyn ballclub due to the complex maze of trolley cars that weaved its way through the borough of Brooklyn.[30] In 1892, the city of Brooklyn (Brooklyn was an independent city until annexed by New York City in 1898) began replacing its slow-moving, horse-drawn trolley lines with the faster, more powerful electric trolley lines.[31] Within less than three years, by the end of 1895, electric trolley accidents in Brooklyn had resulted in more than 130 deaths and maimed well over 500 people.[32] Brooklyn's high profile, the significant number of widely reported accidents, and a trolley strike in early 1895, combined to create a strong association in the public's mind between Brooklyn and trolley dodging.[31] Sportswriters started using the name \"Trolley Dodgers\" to refer to the Brooklyn team early in the 1895 season.[33] The name was shortened to, on occasion, the \"Brooklyn Dodgers\" as early as 1898.[34] Sportswriters in the early 20th century began referring to the Dodgers as the \"Bums\", in reference to the team's fans and possibly because of the \"street character\" nature of Jack Dawkins, the \"Artful Dodger\" in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Newspaper cartoonist Willard Mullin used a drawing of famous clown Emmett Kelly to depict \"Dem Bums\": the team would later use \"Weary Willie\" in promotional images, and Kelly himself was a club mascot during the 1950s. Other team names used by the franchise were the Atlantics, Grays, Grooms, Bridegrooms, Superbas and Robins. All of these nicknames were used by fans and sportswriters to describe the team, but not in any official capacity. The team's legal name was the Brooklyn Base Ball Club.[35] However, the Trolley Dodger nickname was used throughout this period, simultaneously with these other nicknames, by fans and sportswriters of the day. The team did not use the name in any formal sense until 1932, when the word \"Dodgers\" appeared on team jerseys.[5] The \"conclusive shift\" came in 1933, when both home and road jerseys for the team bore the name \"Dodgers\".[6] Examples of how the many popularized names of the team were used are available from newspaper articles before 1932. A New York Times article describing a game in 1916 starts out: \"Jimmy Callahan, pilot of the Pirates, did his best to wreck the hopes the Dodgers have of gaining the National League pennant\", but then goes on to comment: \"the only thing that saved the Superbas from being toppled from first place was that the Phillies lost one of the two games played\".[36] What is interesting about the use of these two nicknames is that most baseball statistics sites and baseball historians generally now refer to the pennant-winning 1916 Brooklyn team as the Robins. A 1918 New York Times article uses the nickname in its title: \"Buccaneers Take Last From Robins\", but the subtitle of the article reads: \"Subdue The Superbas By 11 To 4, Making Series An Even Break\".[37] Another example of the use of the many nicknames is found on the program issued at Ebbets Field for the 1920 World Series, which identifies the matchup in the series as \"Dodgers vs. Indians\" despite the fact that the Robins nickname had been in consistent use for around six years.[38] The \"Robins\" nickname was derived from the name of their Hall of Fame manager, Wilbert Robinson, who led the team from 1914 to 1931.[39] The Dodgers' uniform has remained relatively unchanged since the 1930s. The home jersey is white with \"Dodgers\" written in script across the chest in royal. The road jersey is gray with \"Los Angeles\" written in script across the chest in royal. The word \"Dodgers\" was first used on the front of the team's home jersey in 1933; the uniform was then white with red pinstripes and a stylized \"B\" on the left shoulder.[40] The Dodgers also wore green outlined uniforms and green caps throughout the 1937 season but reverted to blue the following year. The current design was created in 1939, and has remained the same ever since with only cosmetic changes. Originally intended for the 1951 World Series for which the ballclub failed to qualify, red numbers under the \"Dodgers\" script were added to the home uniform in 1952.[41] The road jersey also has a red uniform number under the script. When the franchise moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, the city name on the road jersey changed, and the stylized \"B\" was replaced with the interlocking \"LA\" on the caps in 1958. In 1970, the Dodgers removed the city name from the road jerseys and had \"Dodgers\" on both the home and away uniforms. The city script returned to the road jerseys in 1999, and the tradition-rich Dodgers flirted with an alternate uniform for the first time since 1944 (when all-blue satin uniforms were introduced). These 1999 alternate jerseys had a royal top with the \"Dodgers\" script in white across the chest, and the red number on the front. These were worn with white pants and a new cap with silver brim, top button and Dodger logo. These alternates proved unpopular and the team abandoned them after only one season. In 2014, the Dodgers introduced an alternate road jersey: a gray version with the \"Dodgers\" script instead of the city name.[42] Since its introduction, however, the road jersey with the \"Dodgers\" script was used more often than the road jersey with the \"Los Angeles\" script, so much that the team now considers it as a primary road uniform.[43] In 2018, the Dodgers wore their 60th anniversary patch to honor the 60 years of being in Los Angeles.[44][45] In 2021, the Dodgers again unveiled a blue alternate uniform, this time as part of the \"City Connect\" series in collaboration with Nike. This uniform was similar to the blue alternates they wore in 1999, but with the script \"Los Dodgers\" in homage to Los Angeles' Latino community. The uniform is also worn with blue pants, and black stripes are added to the sleeves. Initially, the Dodgers wore a special blue cap with the \"Los Dodgers\" script, but switched in 2022 to a blue interlocking \"LA\" cap with black brim. The \"Los Dodgers\" script was then relocated to the right side. In 2023, white pants with blue piping replaced the blue pants previously worn with the \"City Connect\" uniform.[46] The Dodgers have been groundbreaking in their signing of players from Asia; mainly Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Former owner Peter O'Malley began reaching out in 1980 by starting clinics in China and South Korea, building baseball fields in two Chinese cities, and in 1998 becoming the first major league team to open an office in Asia. The Dodgers were the second team to start a Japanese player in recent history, pitcher Hideo Nomo, the first team to start a South Korean player, pitcher Chan Ho Park and the first Taiwanese player, Chin-Feng Chen. In addition, they were the first team to send out three Asian pitchers, from different Asian countries, in one game: Park, Hong-Chih Kuo of Taiwan, and Takashi Saito of Japan. In the 2008 season, the Dodgers had the most Asian players on its roster of any major league team with five. They included Japanese pitchers Takashi Saito and Hiroki Kuroda; South Korean pitcher Chan Ho Park; and Taiwanese pitcher Hong-Chih Kuo and infielder Chin-Lung Hu. In 2005, the Dodgers' Hee Seop Choi became the first Asian player to compete in the Home Run Derby.[47] For the 2013 season, the Dodgers signed starting pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu with a six-year, $36 million contract, after posting a bid of nearly $27 million to acquire him from the KBO's Hanhwa Eagles. For the 2016 season, the Dodgers signed starting pitcher Kenta Maeda with an eight-year, $25 million contract, after posting a bid of $20 million to acquire him from the NPB's Hiroshima Toyo Carp. The Dodgers' rivalry with the San Francisco Giants dates back to the 19th century, when the two teams were based in New York; the rivalry with the New York Yankees took place when the Dodgers were based in New York, but was revived with their East Coast/West Coast World Series battles in 1963, 1977, 1978, and 1981. The Dodgers' rivalries with the Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals also dates back to their days in New York, but were most fierce during the 1970s, 1980s and 2000s. The Dodgers also shared a heated rivalry with the Cincinnati Reds during the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. The Dodgers' had even shared a rather volatile rivalry with divisional foes; the Arizona Diamondbacks during most of the 2010s. Their intra-city rivalry with the Los Angeles Angels dates back to the Angels' inaugural season in 1961. The Dodgers have recently revived an old Southern California based rivalry with the San Diego Padres dating back to the Padres' inaugural season in 1969. Most recently; the Dodgers have also regrown a heated rivalry against the former divisional foe Houston Astros after their relocation to the American League, due in no small part to the controversy of the 2017 World Series. The Dodgers–Giants rivalry is one of the longest-standing rivalries in U.S. baseball.[48][49] The feud between the Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in New York City, with the Dodgers playing in Brooklyn and the Giants playing at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan. After the 1957 season, Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley moved the team to Los Angeles for financial and other reasons.[50] Along the way, he managed to convince Giants owner Horace Stoneham—who was considering moving his team to Minnesota—to preserve the rivalry by bringing his team to California as well.[50] New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move.[50][51] Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have been bitter rivals in economic, cultural, and political arenas for over a century and a half, the new venue in California became fertile ground for its transplantation. Each team's ability to endure for over a century while moving across an entire continent, as well as the rivalry's leap from a cross-city to a cross-state engagement, have led to the rivalry being considered one of the greatest in American sports history.[52][53][54] Unlike many other historic baseball match-ups in which one team remains dominant for most of their history, the Dodgers–Giants rivalry has exhibited a persistent balance in the respective successes of the two teams. While the Giants have more wins in franchise history, the Dodgers have the most National League pennants at 24, with the Giants following close behind at 23. The Giants have won eight World Series titles, while the Dodgers have won seven. The 2010 World Series was the Giants' first championship since moving to California, while the Dodgers had won six World Series titles since their move, their last title coming in the 2020 World Series.[55][56] In 2021, the Dodgers and Giants both finished the regular season with over 100 wins, with the latter clinching the division with a record of 107–55. The Dodgers were one game behind with a record of 106–56, relegating them to the NL Wild Card Game, in which they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals. This resulted in the first postseason matchup between Dodgers and Giants in the NLDS. With a combined 213 regular season wins, this is the most number of regular season wins between competing teams in any MLB postseason series.[57] The Dodgers ultimately won in the decisive Game 5, but would lose in the NLCS to the eventual World Series champions: Atlanta Braves.[58] This rivalry refers to a series of games played with the Los Angeles Angels.[59] The Freeway Series takes its name from the massive freeway system in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, the home of both teams; one could travel from one team's stadium to the other simply by traveling along Interstate 5. The term is akin to Subway Series which refers to meetings between New York City baseball teams.[60] The term \"Freeway Series\" also inspired the official name of the region's NHL rivalry: the Freeway Face-Off. Animosity between the team's fanbases grew stronger in 2005, when the Angels' new team owner Arte Moreno changed the name of his ball club from the 'Anaheim Angels', to the 'Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim'.[61] Since the city of Anaheim is located roughly 30 miles from Downtown Los Angeles, the Angels franchise was ridiculed throughout the league for the contradictory nature surrounding the name, especially by Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, who filed a formal complaint to commissioner Bud Selig.[62] Once the complaint was denied, McCourt devised a t-shirt mocking the crosstown rivals reading 'The Los Angeles Dodgers of Los Angeles', which remains popular amongst the fanbase to this day.[63] The Padres-Dodgers rivalry has often been lopsided in favor of the Dodgers; however, recent growth between the two teams in competition has added intensity on top of proximity between Los Angeles and San Diego.[64][65] San Diego fans have often harbored animosity towards Los Angeles due in small part to San Diego being an unstable home for their sports teams as both the Chargers and the Clippers both relocated to Los Angeles after being unable to find a secure future in San Diego. The Dodgers currently lead the series 518—419, with the two teams meeting in the playoffs twice.[66] The Dodgers swept the Padres in the 2020 NLDS, and the Padres won in four games in the 2022 NLDS.[67] The rivalry between the Dodgers and the Arizona Diamondbacks was one of the fiercest divisional matchups for multiple years, particularly during the 2010s as both teams were in regular contention for control of the division.[68] In addition to the elevated competition, animosity rose immensely between both sides resulting in multiple incidents involving either team throwing pitches at one another, occasionally escalating into several bench-clearing brawls. Famously; after eliminating the Diamondbacks and clinching the division on September 19, 2013; multiple Dodgers' players celebrated the win by jumping into the pool at Chase Field.[69] rather ironically on December 8, 2015; Zack Greinke would sign a six-year, $206.5 million contract with the Diamondbacks in free agency. Both teams met during the 2017 National League Division Series as the Diamondbacks were no match for LA as they were swept 3—0 by the Dodgers en route to their appearance in the World Series. The teams rematched in the 2023 National League Division Series, with the Diamondbacks returning the favor with a 3—0 sweep of their own as they eventually reached the World Series. The Dodgers lead the series 259—193, with the teams tied 3—3 in the postseason.[70] Primarily a playoff rivalry; since 1892, The Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals have met six times in the postseason, with two meetings in the NLCS falling in favor of the Cardinals. Both teams have recently grown a history of animosity towards one another since the late 2000s, as both teams often met frequently in the postseason. The Dodgers have not fared as well against the Cardinals in the postseason. In five prior postseason series matchups, the Cardinals have won four, with the Dodgers winning only the 2009 NLDS and the 2021 National League Wild Card Game.[71][72] The Dodgers' rivalry with the New York Yankees is one of the most well-known rivalries in Major League Baseball.[73] The two teams have met eleven times in the World Series, more times than any other two teams from the American and National Leagues.[73] The initial significance was embodied in the two teams' proximity in New York City, when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn. After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958, the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the two most dominant cities on opposite sides of the United States since the 1980s. Although the rivalry's significance arose from the two teams' numerous World Series meetings,[73] the Yankees and Dodgers have not met in the World Series since 1981.[73] They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004, when they played a three-game interleague series.[73] Their last meeting was in June 2023, when the Yankees won two out of three games in Los Angeles.[74] The series between the Dodgers and the Houston Astros had initially begun as a divisional matchup but following Houston's realignment to the American League, the rivalry regained intensity as the two teams played one another in the 2017 World Series in which the Astros controversially won the championship in seven games. Animosity grew further when the Astros' widely publicized sign stealing scandal drew negative attention to the organization, after it was revealed the team had utilized a complex system to steal pitch signs, including during the 2017 World Series. As a result of the scandal, hostility grew immensely between the two teams and their fans.[75] The Dodgers lead the all time series 400-334, both teams are tied in postseason wins 6-6. In 2012, a Bleacher Report article referred to Dodgers fans as the best sports fanbase in Los Angeles.[76] Following the team's relocation to California, attendance had gone from eleventh during their final season in Brooklyn to second in their first season in Los Angeles.[77] Initially during construction of Dodger Stadium, Walter O'Malley feared the size of the ballpark would prove to be too difficult to fill on a regular basis once completed in 1962. This proved not to be the case as the Dodgers led the league in attendance by a sizeable margin for the 1962 season, nearly doubling that of the New York Yankees.[78][79] In 1978 the Dodgers became the first MLB team to attract more than three million fans in a season, and repeated the feat six more times before any other franchise reached three million fans overall.[16] The Dodgers drew at least three million fans for 15 consecutive seasons from 1996 to 2010, the longest such streak among all MLB teams.[16] The team's largest fan club, Pantone 294 (a reference to the Pantone code of Dodger blue), regularly travels to away games to cheer for the Dodgers.[80] The Dodgers have regularly placed in the top three in attendance, or have led the league numerous times since 2000, excluding the 2020 season; the Dodgers have recently led the league in attendance for nine straight seasons going back to 2013.[81][82][83] On July 3, 2007, Dodgers management announced that total franchise attendance, dating back to 1901, had reached 175 million, a record for all professional sports.[84] In 2007, the Dodgers set a franchise record for single-season attendance, attracting over 3.8 million fans.[85] On March 28, 2008, the Dodgers set the world record for the largest attendance for a single baseball game during an exhibition game against the Boston Red Sox at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in honor of the Dodgers' 50th anniversary, with 115,300 fans in attendance.[86] In 2009, the Dodgers led MLB in total attendance.[17] The Dodger baseball cap is consistently in the top three in sales.[87] Primarily, Dodgers fans originate from most of southern or central California and also parts of southern Nevada. The fanbase has also extended out to states across the southwest such as Arizona, New Mexico and even western Texas.[88][89] In 2015, Vivid Seats reported that the Dodgers were the most popular MLB team in Utah based on ticket sales.[90] Dodgers' away games throughout the US will usually attract substantial numbers of expats and traveling fans.[91] Given the team's proximity to Hollywood, numerous celebrities can often be seen attending home games at Dodger Stadium. Celebrities such as co-owner Magic Johnson, Flea, Mary Hart, DaBaby, Larry King, Tiger Woods, Alyssa Milano, Shia LaBeouf, Lana Del Rey, Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher[92] are known to frequently attend Dodger games, with some sitting at field box seats behind home plate where they sign autographs for fellow Dodger fans. Actor Bryan Cranston is a lifelong Dodger fan.[93] Abroad; the Dodgers have a strongly devoted following in Mexico due to the impact of Mexican players such as Fernando Valenzuela, Ismael Valdéz, or more recently; Julio Urias. The impact of the Dodgers' extensive fanbase across Mexico, and among the Mexican-American community is ever present, as an estimated 54% of fans in home attendance are of Mexican descent.[94][95][96] Notably; Mel Almada, the first Mexican-born player in league history, was also a southern California native, he played for the Dodgers near the tail end of his career in 1939. The fanbase is also present throughout Asian countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan due to the impacts of Japanese players such as Hideo Nomo, Hiroki Kuroda, Kenta Maeda or Yu Darvish. The Dodgers grew fan attention in South Korea, as they became the first MLB team to sign the first South Korean-born player in league history: Chan Ho Park in 1994. The Dodgers had also strengthened their ties with their recruitment of South Korean players, following the signing of All-Star pitcher Hyun Jin Ryu in 2013. The team partnered with the Korean communities of Los Angeles and began hosting an annual Korean Heritage night since 2016.[97] The Dodgers made history for signing the first Taiwanese player in MLB, Chin-Feng Chen in 2002; other Taiwanese players such as Chin-Lung Hu and Chin-Hui Tsao would also eventually sign with the Dodgers, largely growing fan support from the country.[98][99] As of 2023, the primary play-by-play announcers on television and radio, respectively, are Joe Davis and Charley Steiner, with Orel Hershiser (TV) and Rick Monday (radio) working as the primary color commentators. On some games, Stephen Nelson would fill in for Davis during his national assignments with Fox Sports, with Davis typically working as the lead voice of the MLB on Fox and as one of the play-by-play voices of the NFL on Fox. Nomar Garciaparra, Eric Karros, Dontrelle Willis and Jessica Mendoza often fill in for Hershiser on select games. On the radio side, Tim Neverett works play-by-play on select games, and also fills in for Davis on television broadcasts.[100] From 1950 to 2016, almost all Dodger games were called by Vin Scully.[101] His longtime partners were Jerry Doggett (1956–1987) and Ross Porter (1977–2004).[101] In 1976, he was selected by Dodgers fans as the Most Memorable Personality (on the field or off) in the team's history. He is also a recipient of the Baseball Hall of Fame's Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters (inducted in 1982). Unlike the modern style in which multiple sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer and the other[s] as color commentator), Scully, Doggett and Porter generally called games solo, trading with each other inning-by-inning. In the 1980s and 1990s, Scully would call the entire radio broadcast except for the third and seventh inning, allowing the other Dodger commentators to broadcast an inning. Fans and critics alike frequently praised Scully due in large part for his longevity with the team, and his ability to provide peculiar details about multiple players appearing onfield. Despite his longevity and a strong relationship with the team and fanbase, Scully was also praised for his relatively unbiased view of any game he called, often referring to the listeners as 'friends' instead of 'fans'.[102] When Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast games for the California Angels and Chicago White Sox.[101] Drysdale died in his hotel room following a heart attack before a game in Montreal in 1993. This was a difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter who could not mention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official announcement made.[103] He was replaced by former Dodgers outfielder Rick Monday.[101] Porter's tenure ended after the 2004 season, after which the format of play-by-play announcers and color commentators was installed, led by Monday and newcomer Charley Steiner.[101] Scully, however, continued to announce solo. Scully called roughly 100 games per season (all home games and road games in California and Arizona)[104] for both flagship radio station KLAC and on television for Spectrum SportsNet LA. Scully was simulcast for the first three innings of each of his appearances, then announced only for the TV audience. If Scully was calling the game, Steiner took over play-by-play on radio beginning with the fourth inning, with Monday as color commentator.[104] If Scully was not calling the game, Steiner and Orel Hershiser called the entire game on television while Monday and Kevin Kennedy did the same on radio. In the event the Dodgers were in post-season play, Scully called the first three and last three innings of the radio broadcast alone and Steiner and Monday handled the middle innings.[105] Vin Scully retired from calling games in 2016. His tenure with the Dodgers was the longest with any single sports team at 67 years. Youthful announcer Joe Davis was selected in 2017 by Dodgers management to handle play by play on television with Orel Hershiser as his colorman. The Dodgers also broadcast on radio in two other languages, Spanish and Korean. From 1959 to 2022, the Spanish play-by-play is voiced by another Frick Award winner, Jaime Jarrín. The color analyst for some games is former Dodger pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, for whom Jarrin once translated post-game interviews. Since 2023, Valuenzuela is joined on the Spanish booth by Pepe Yñiguez and José Mota, son of Dodger legend Manny Mota.[100] The Spanish-language radio flagship station is KTNQ. Meanwhile, the Dodgers' Korean broadcast began in 2013 through KMPC.[106][107] Dave BancroftDan BrouthersRoy CampanellaMax Carey1Kiki CuylerLeo Durocher2Burleigh Grimes1 Ned HanlonBilly HermanGil HodgesWaite HoytHughie JenningsWillie KeelerJoe KelleyGeorge Kelly Tony LazzeriFreddie LindstromErnie LombardiAl LópezHeinie ManushRabbit MaranvilleRube MarquardTommy McCarthy Joe McGinnityJoe MedwickPee Wee ReeseJackie RobinsonWilbert Robinson†Duke SniderCasey Stengel2 Dazzy VanceArky VaughanLloyd WanerPaul WanerJohn Montgomery Ward1Zack WheatHack Wilson Walter AlstonJim BunningGary Carter Don DrysdaleRickey HendersonSandy KoufaxTommy Lasorda2 Greg MadduxJuan MarichalPedro MartínezFred McGriff Eddie MurrayWalter O'Malley‡Mike PiazzaFrank Robinson Don SuttonJim ThomeJoe TorreHoyt Wilhelm Red Barber Ernie Harwell Al Helfer Jaime Jarrín Vin Scully Koufax, Campanella, and Robinson were the first Dodgers to have their numbers retired, in a ceremony at Dodger Stadium on June 4, 1972. This was the year in which Koufax was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame; Robinson and Campanella were already Hall-of-Famers. Alston's number was retired in the year following his retirement as the Dodgers manager, six years before he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Gilliam died suddenly in 1978 after a 28-year career with the Dodgers organization. The Dodgers retired his number two days after his death, prior to Game 1 of the 1978 World Series. As of 2018, he is the only non-Hall-of-Famer to have his number retired by the Dodgers (Alston's number was retired before he was elected to the Hall of Fame). Beginning in 1980, the Dodgers have retired the numbers of longtime Dodgers (Snider, Reese, Drysdale, Lasorda, Sutton, and Hodges) during the seasons in which each was inducted into the Hall of Fame. In 1997, 50 years after he broke the color barrier and 25 years after the Dodgers retired his number, Robinson's No. 42 was retired throughout Major League Baseball. Robinson is the only major league baseball player to have this honor bestowed upon him. Starting in the 2007 season, Jackie Robinson Day (April 15, commemorating Opening Day of Robinson's rookie season of 1947) has featured many or all players and coaches wearing the number 42 as a tribute to Robinson. In 2017, the Dodgers honored broadcaster Vin Scully with a microphone displayed alongside the team's retired numbers.[109] In 2018, Spanish language broadcaster Jaime Jarrín was honored with a microphone displayed alongside the team's retired numbers.[110] In 2019, the Dodgers established \"Legends of Dodger Baseball\", which is to meant honor Dodger greats. The program honors those who made an \"impact on the franchise, both on and off the field.\" Recipients are recognized with plaques at Dodger Stadium.[111] Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches Restricted list 38 active, 0 inactive, 0 non-roster invitees 7-, 10-, or 15-day injured list * Not on active roster † Suspended list Roster, coaches, and NRIs updated November 14, 2023 Transactions • Depth chart → All MLB rosters Since 1884, the Dodgers have used a total of 31 Managers, the most current being Dave Roberts, who was appointed following the 2015 postseason, after the departure of Don Mattingly. Over the nearly 43 years from 1954 to mid-1996, the Dodgers employed only two managers, Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda, both of whom are in the Hall of Fame. During this entire time period of extraordinary stability, the Dodgers were family-owned by Walter O'Malley and then his son Peter O'Malley. It was during this era that the Dodgers won 11 of their 24 pennants, and their first six World Series championships. The managers of the Los Angeles Dodgers (1958–present) are as follows: From the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles from Brooklyn in 1958, the Dodgers employed a handful of well-known public address announcers; the most famous of which was John Ramsey, who served as the PA voice of the Dodgers from 1958 until his retirement in 1982; he was also well known for announcing at other venerable Los Angeles venues, including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Sports Arena, and the Forum. Ramsey died in 1990. From 1958 to 1982, Doug Moore, Philip Petty, and Dennis Packer served as back-up voices for John Ramsey for the Dodgers, California Angels, Los Angeles Chargers, USC football and Los Angeles Rams. Packer was Ramsey's primary backup for the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings until Ramsey's retirement from the Forum in 1978. Thereafter, Packer became the public address announcer for the Lakers, Kings, indoor soccer and indoor tennis events at the Forum. Nick Nickson, a radio broadcaster for the Los Angeles Kings, replaced John Ramsey as the Dodger Stadium public address announcer in 1983 and served in that capacity through the 1989 season to work with the Kings full-time. Dennis Packer and Pete Arbogast were emulators of John Ramsey, using the same stentorian style of announcing Ramsey was famous for. Packer and Arbogast shared the stadium announcing chores for the 1994 FIFA World Cup matches at the Rose Bowl. Arbogast won the Dodgers job on the day that Ramsey died on January 25, 1990, by doing a verbatim imitation of Ramsey's opening and closing remarks that were standard at each game. His replacement, in 1994 was Mike Carlucci, who remained as the Dodgers' PA voice announcer until he resigned in 2002 to concentrate on his voiceover and acting career along with his Olympics announcing duties. From 2003 to 2014, the Dodgers public address announcer was Eric Smith, who also announces for the Los Angeles Clippers and USC Trojans.[112] On April 3, 2015, the Dodgers announced that former radio broadcaster Todd Leitz was hired to become their new public address announcer. Leitz was an anchor and news reporter in Los Angeles at KNX 1070 AM for 10 years, and a news reporter at KABC 790 for two years.[113] From 1988 to 2015, Nancy Bea enjoyed popularity behind the Dodger Stadium keyboard similar to Gladys Goodding. Since retirement in 2015, Bea's replacement and current organist is Dieter Ruehle, who also plays at Staples Center for Los Angeles Kings games. Vin Scully is permanently honored in the Baseball Hall of Fame's \"Scribes & Mikemen\" exhibit as a result of winning the Ford C. Frick Award in 1982. Frick Award recipients are not official members of the Hall. Sue Falsone, was the first female physical therapist in Major League baseball, and from 2012 to 2013, was the first female head athletic trainer. The Los Angeles Dodgers farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates.[114]", "Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker", "The 2020 World Series title will forever be remembered as the crowning moment for the LA Dodgers or Tampa Bay Rays in one of the most bizarre seasons in MLB history that was played during a worldwide pandemic. At the start of the shortened 60-game season, many experts predicted the Dodgers would be in this position after reaching the Series twice in the last three seasons, losing both times. How many World Series titles have the Dodgers won? The Brooklyn Dodgers won their first National League pennant in 1941, before losing to the New York Yankees. It was the beginning of the Dodgers-Yankees rivalry. During the next 13 years, the Dodgers won the pennant four times, but then fell painfully each time to the hated Yankees. In 1955, the club finally had its breakthrough. Led by the first Black player of the modern era in Jackie Robinson and three-time NL MVP Roy Campanella, the Dodgers managed to overcome their rivals to win the organization’s first World Series title in seven games. It turned out to be the club’s only title in Brooklyn. In 1957, after much wrangling with New York City officials about a potential new stadium, Dodgers owner Walter O’Malley received an offer to move the team to LA. He accepted. The LA Dodgers played their first game in California in April 1958. The club had a new home, but the same core of quality players, and it didn’t take them long to make it back to the top. After a lackluster performance that first season in LA, the Dodgers rebounded quite nicely the following year, winning the World Series 4-2 over the Chicago White Sox. Four years later, the Dodgers made it back to the World Series and faced a familiar foe in the New York Yankees. It wasn’t a contest as the Dodgers quickly swept their former cross-town rivals and won their third World Series title. In 1965, the Dodgers won their fourth World Series title, defeating the Minnesota Twins in seven games. Then, it was a flashback to the 1940s. Over the next 14 seasons, the team made it to the Series on four occasions, falling short each time. In 1981, LA broke the streak beating the Yankees in six games and the Dodgers won their fifth World Series crown. The World Series Narrative on the Los Angeles Dodgers and Tampa Bay Rays Is Wrong For the rest of the 1980s, the Dodgers had their ups and downs. Outside of reaching the NLCS in 1983 and 1985, the club didn’t even make the playoffs the other seasons, the exception coming in 1988. That was a magical season for the Dodgers and their fans. Pitcher Orel Hershiser dominated opposing batters to the tune of a 2.26 ERA and a league-leading 23 wins. He finished the season with a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings. Hershiser provided the pitching that season, and Kirk Gibson, who came over from the Detroit Tigers in the offseason, provided the offense. Gibson, who won the NL MVP that season, is most remembered for his dramatic appearance in Game 1 of the World Series against the Oakland Athletics. Manager Tommy Lasorda called on the injured Gibson in the bottom of the ninth to pinch hit against Oakland star closer Dennis Eckersley. Gibson stepped up to the plate, blasted a game-winning two-run homer, then hobbled around the bases. It was one of the most iconic moments in World Series history and propelled the Dodgers to win the Series in five games. That year, however, is the last time the Dodgers won a World Series title. With a victory over the Tampa Bay Rays, it would be the Dodgers’ seventh World Series title and also one to remember because of the extraordinary circumstances the team had to overcome on and off the field to achieve it.", "The Dodgers won the World Series in six games, just as the Yankees had done in the previous two series matchups in 1977 and 1978. This was the Dodgers' first championship since 1965, their first triumph over the Yankees since 1963, and their third Series victory against the Yankees overall. Hall of Famers Roy Campanella and Carl Erskine were part of that 1963 team that came from behind to defeat New York 4-3 in Game 7 at Dodger Stadium. Los Angeles returned to the Series in 1981 but lost to the Yankees again, this time in seven games. The Dodgers haven't been back to the Series since, though they have made several attempts over the past 30 years. Their most recent try ended in 2009 when they were defeated by the Yankee Empire State for the second straight year. That season saw Derek Jeter join Mariano Rivera as a single-season saves leader with 52 while teammate Andy Pettitte finished with the highest winning percentage (.615) among pitchers who appeared in at least 15 games. The Yankees went on to beat the Phillies in five games to claim their 26th title. In between these two defeats, the Yankees eliminated the Dodgers in five games in 2004 and 2007. On both occasions, however, the Dodgers got back into the Series after losing the first game. The squad has six World Series championships and 23 National League pennants. The Dodgers were initially known as the Atlantics when they were founded in 1883 in Brooklyn, New York. In 1884, the squad entered the American Association and won the league championship in 1889. In 1890, the team moved to New York and was renamed the New Yorkers. In 1891, the New Yorkers joined the National League and have been members of that league ever since. They are one of only two teams (the other being the Chicago Cubs) to have never left the league during their existence. The Dodgers have won five World Series titles - in 1955, 1957, 1959, 1963, and 1965 - and have appeared in nine others. Currently, the team is owned by Frank McCourt and plays its home games at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. The stadium is also the largest individual donor in NFL history with a total donation value of $150 million. Dodgers fans can be found in high numbers throughout Southern California. But because the team has no local presence on television, they don't receive much attention from people who aren't baseball fans. According to ESPN, 70% of all Dodgers fans live in California while 25% reside in Florida. The remaining 5% come from other states including Arizona, Nevada, and Texas. The Los Angeles Dodgers won their first World Series victory since 1988 and eighth overall, defeating the Tampa Bay Rays 4 games to 2. They are the second NL team to win after losing the first two games of the series (the Chicago Cubs were the first in 2016). The Dodgers' victory was also their first over the Rays at Tropicana Field. In addition to winning the World Series, the Dodgers also played in another game that resulted in a tie - the 9th inning of Game 5. In this game, neither team was able to score while two runners were on base so the game had to be decided by extra innings. The game went into the 12th and 13th innings without a result before the Dodgers came back to win it. During the season, the Dodgers played 21 games against other National League teams and finished with a record of 14-7. They defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in the Division Series before being eliminated by the Boston Red Sox in the Championship Series. The Dodgers played only one game against an American League team during the season - a three-game series against the Houston Astros at Dodger Stadium. They lost all three games but one game was decided by one run. The other two games were decided by more than one run. After relocating to Los Angeles, the team won the National League pennant in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1974, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1988, 2017, 2018, and 2020, as well as the World Series in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1981, 1988, and 2020. The Dodgers have played in 21 World Series, nine in Brooklyn and twelve in Los Angeles. They have won eight world championships, most recently in 2015. After spending more than a decade as tenants of Dodger Stadium, following their own franchise move the team is once again winning on national television with Andre Ethier and Carl Crawford leading the way for one of the best offenses in baseball. Although they lost Game 7 of the NLCS to the Chicago Cubs, they still managed to win the series in seven games. That means that the Dodgers will be heading back to the World Series for the third straight year! Los Angeles has been the home of the Dodgers since 1958. Before then, the team had only played in Brooklyn from 1891 to 1957. In 1957, the club moved to New York City where they remained until moving back to Brooklyn four years later. Since the move back to Brooklyn, the team has failed to make it past the first round of the playoffs each year. In 1960, the Dodgers' ownership group led by Walter O'Malley decided to build their own stadium after being rejected several times by the city council when trying to secure funding for a new ballpark.

The song was released as a single in 1988 on Enigma Records and reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #19 on the Mainstream rock charts.[5] It also charted at number 10 on the Australian charts and number 35 on the UK Singles chart.[6] The music video features a restaurant employee, played by the same actor who appeared in the video for Mötley Crüe's \"You're All I Need\", washing dishes while listening to the Kiss hit single \"Rock and Roll All Nite\", performed by Poison who recorded that for the Less than Zero soundtrack in 1987. The manager is angry that he enters, turns off the radio, and delivers to the employee a scathing reprimand, reminding the employee that he is being paid \"to wash dishes, not to listen to that... that rock 'n' roll,\" and accusing him of \"moving in two speeds: slow, and stop.\" The manager exits, whereupon the employee abandons the dishes and kicks open a nearby door to reveal a concert hall stage, upon which the band then performs the song. When the song is over, the manager returns, discovering, to his surprise, that all the dishes are washed. It was played in heavy rotation on MTV in 1987. \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" is widely regarded as one of Poison's best songs. In 2017, Billboard and OC Weekly ranked the song number nine and number four, respectively, on their lists of the ten greatest Poison tracks.[7][8] Music critic Steve Huey of Allmusic has also stated that \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" became one of the bands \"most widely recognized signature songs\" as well as that parent album Open Up and Say...

Made famous by Italian tenor, Andrea Bocelli, after he debuted the song at the 1995 Sanremo Music Festival, the work has become one of the musician’s best-known. Released on Bocelli’s second studio album, the song has become one of the best-selling singles of all time. It was written by Francesco Sartori, an Italian trumpet player, pianist and composer, and its lyrics were by songwriter, Lucio Quarantotto. Due to the international acclaim Bocelli found with the song, he went on to release further versions of the song in other languages. Read more: When the world saw a young Andrea Bocelli sing ‘Con te partirò’ for the very first time Whilst the original 1995 song was written in Italian, Bocelli went on to release both an English and Spanish version. In 1996 Bocelli released a second version of the song as a duet with English soprano, Sarah Brightman. Sung partly in English, the song went on to sell more than 12 million copies worldwide. It became the biggest-selling single in Germany of all time, and the duo would go on to record a version sung in German and Italian. Bocelli’s Spanish version of the song released a year later in 1997, titled, Por ti volaré (in English – For You I Will Fly). Read more: ‘Time to Say Goodbye’ by Andrea Bocelli named a funeral favourite In a 2019 study by Co-op Funeralcare, Bocelli and Brightman’s performance of ‘Time to Say Goodbye’ was ranked as the nation’s second favourite choice of music for a funeral, due to its farewell theme. But, despite the seemingly lyrical ‘goodbye’, there are conflicting thoughts as to what the lyrics of ‘Time to Say Goodbye’ are actually trying to say. In English, the lyrics seem to tell the story of a protagonist who is saying goodbye to countries they never saw or shared with his lover. But then halfway through the song, it seems the lovers will in fact go to those countries... except they’ll be travelling on ships that don’t exist anymore. So it’s time to say goodbye again. Not the clearest of translations. However, due to the romantic and hopeful nature of the melody, many have interpreted the song as not being on the theme of ‘goodbyes’ but rather, new chapters. The literal translation of the Italian tune, Con te partirò is I will leave with you, suggesting instead that no matter where the lovers in the song are going, they will be going together.

Specifically, the story is set in the city of Salzburg and the surrounding region of the Austrian Alps. The film showcases the beautiful landscapes, landmarks, and architecture of Austria, providing a stunning backdrop for the musical's iconic songs and heartfelt story.", "token_usage": 62, "human_written_evidences": [], "reference_documents": [], "model_retrieved_documents": ["Ask any group of people about their favorite movie of all time, and the answer will inevitably be the 1965 musical drama film ‘The Sound of Music’. Directed by the multiple Academy Award winning luminary Robert Wise (who also directed ‘West Side Story’), the film boasted the talents of Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and was phenomenal commercial success, managing to rake in three hundred million dollars way back in the 1960s. Today, the legacy of ‘The Sound of Music’ is irreproachable, having five Academy Awards to its name and enduring renown that continues to make the film relevant even today. Based on the 1959 stage musical of the same name (which in turn is based on the memoir “The Story of the Trapp Family Singers” by Maria von Trapp), ‘The Sound of Music’ follows the von Trapp family and their new governess Maria. Maria is a struggling nun who is assigned the job of taking care of the exceedingly mischievous seven von Trapp children. Their father, Georg von Trapp, is a retired naval captain who runs his household with military discipline after the death of his wife. While initially cold and hostile towards Maria, the von Trapp children eventually fall for her kind demeanor and melodious personality. Even the stoic captain finds himself falling for Maria affable charms but their idyllic lifestyle is threatened when the Nazis start to take over their country. If you were wondering what were ‘The Sound of Music’ filming locations, read on. The backdrop for much of ‘The Sound of Music’ is the charming pre World War II town of Salzburg in Austria during the 1930s. The scenery shows off distant snow-capped mountain peaks, verdant hilltops perfect for breaking into a spontaneous melody, and cultured medieval buildings that occupy the imagination. While it is possible to recreate these distinctive features of the region on a set as well, such a facsimile is unlikely to be nearly as authentic as the real thing. This is especially true of the 1960s when CGI wasn’t really an option for filmmakers. Keeping this in mind, ‘The Sound of Music’ was largely filmed on location in Austria itself, specifically in the city of Salzburg. Limited filming for scenes was also done in studio in California, as well as a few scenes in Bavaria, Germany. Principal filming commenced in late March 1964 and concluded later that year in September.

The production started out with the filming of Maria’s bedroom scenes as well as the nun Abbey cloister. Sketch artist Maurice Zuberano accompanied director Robert Wise to scout for locations in Austria. After a ten week period, Zuberano prepared a set of storyboards and location photos to art director Boris Leven, who designed and constructed the interior sets at Fox Studios in painstaking detail. It is on these sets that parts of the gazebo scenes in the wildly popular songs “Something Good” and “Sixteen Going on Seventeen” were filmed. The 20th century Fox Studios have served as the filming location for many world renowned films and TV shows including ‘Modern Family’, ‘Fight Club’, ‘Edward Scissorhands’, and ‘Arrested Development’. The majority of the filming for ‘The Sound of Music’ took place in and around the delightful city of Salzburg in Austria. The wedding scenes were filmed at the Benedictine monastery of Mondsee Abbey in Upper Austria, with on location filming also done at Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and the Altstadt Old Town area of Salzburg.

Initially, the town leaders were opposed to Wise’s use of Nazi Swastika banners in the background, which were fairly central to the film’s plot. The story of how Wise got the city leaders to relent is rather fascinating – He threatened to incorporate older newsreel footage of Hitler being cheered on by the Salzburg crowd during a visit in his film. Wise’s gamble paid off handsomely, and he continued filming in Austria unhindered. The von Tapp villa itself was filmed at multiple locations; the Frohnburg Palace made up the front and back of the manor’s facade, while the backyard was represented by the Schloss Leopoldskron palace nearby. Other filming locations in Salzburg include the St. Margarethen Chapel and Dürer Studios, which were used during days interrupted by heavy rain (which happened quite often in Salzburg).

Austria • See & Do One of the most famous musical films, The Sound of Music, which was filmed in 1965 is still loved by many today. Each year hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Salzburg, Austria to walk in the footsteps of the legendary Von Trapp family. If you are a fan of the movie and wondering where the Sound of Music was filmed, you’ve come to the right place. From the gazebo where Liesl sings “16 going on 17” to the Abbey where Maria lived and got married, here are all the must-visit Sound of Music filming locations. Recommendation: Relive the scenes of some of the most popular Sound of Music locations in Salzburg including Leopoldskron Palace, Nonnberg Abbey, and Mirabell Gardens on a guided Sound of Music tour. With an English speaking guide, and songs from the soundtrack playing throughout the tour, this Original Sound of Music tour from Salzburg won’t disappoint! Marvel at the breathtaking locations for the Sound of Music and sing through the streets of Salzburg. Founded in 714 A.D., Nonnberg Abbey (German: Stift Nonnberg) is the oldest female convent north of the Alps and is where the real-life Maria became a novice nun and got married to Georg von Trapp. Nonnberg is where four scenes from the movie were filmed: the scene of the nuns singing “Maria” in the courtyard, Maria leaving the abbey, the kids visiting her at the abbey, and the Nazi’s hunting the Von Trapps. Visitors will notice the interior of the Abbey is different from the movie, as filming inside the convent was not allowed, so the interior scenes were shot in a Hollywood studio. A highlight of this Sound of Music location in Salzburg is hearing the resident nuns Gregorian chants in Latin at 6:45 in the morning inside the beautiful Gothic abbey. The small yet beautiful flower filled St. Peter’s Cemetery (German: Petersfriedhof) was the inspiration for the cemetery rebuilt on set for the scene towards the end of the movie in which the Von Trapps hide from the Nazis behind tombs. Beside being the resting place of Mozart’s sister, Nannerl, this is also the resting place of Max Detweiler, “Uncle Max” from the movie. This unique cemetery is one of the oldest (and most beautiful) cemeteries in the world and is Salzburg’s oldest Christian cemetery. The catacombs carved out of the rocks of Mönchsberg provide a stunning view over the beautiful cemetery and should be visited during your Sound of Music tour in Salzburg. This baroque style garden, which was built in 1606 by the archbishop Wolf Dietrich for his mistress is a beautifully landscaped garden filled with gorgeous flowers, marble statues, fountains, and ample opportunities to reenact scenes from the movies. The iconic song, “Do Re, Mi” was partially shot here. While visiting Mirabell gardens, you’ll relive the scene of Maria and the Von Trapp kids dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, jumping up and down the steps, as well as running through the hedge maze tunnel, all the while admiring the breathtaking view of Hohensalzburg Fortress in the distance. This film location spot, which can be visited for free, should not be missed. Situated in the center of Salzburg old town is Residence Square (German: Residenzplatz), which is home to the largest (45 feet tall) baroque fountain outside of Italy. It is in this square while singing “I Have Confidence in Me”, that Maria happily splashes water in the fountain, The Nazi soliders also march through the square later in the movie and hang their flag over the entrance of the old Residence Palace. Built in the 17th century to wash the horses of the prince-archbishop, the Horse Pond (German: Pferdeschwemme) was briefly featured in the movie as a backdrop to Maria and the kids singing “My Favorite Things” while dancing in their clothes made from curtains. In addition to being featured in the musical, the Horse Pond is well worth a visit in its own right. It is situation below the cliff side of Mönchsberg, and the bright fresco behind the horse pond makes for a gorgeous picture to add to your Sound of Music tour album. Carved into the Mönchsberg, the Rock Riding School (German: Felsenreitschule) was initially built to be a cathedral, but was later repurposed by the archbishop into a riding school where tournaments were held. Today it’s Salzburg’s most popular concert venue and is where the real Von Trapp family won the Salzburg Music Festival in 1936. Fans will recognize this Sound of Music filming location from the scene where the Captain sings “Edelweiss” and his family joins him on stage to sing “So Long, Farewell”. Frohnburg Palace played an important role in the Sound of Music as it was one of the two filming locations for the Von Trapp Villa. Once a private residence, the palace is now a Music Academy, the facade and large iron gate is where Maria first set her eyes on the Von Trapp family home towards the end of the song “I Have Confidence”. The Palace was also featured in the movie during the scenes in which the Captain rips the Nazi flag from above the doorway and during the family’s attempt to escape from the Nazis by pushing their car silently out of the gate. Just outside the city center is Hellbrunn Palace, home to the Sound of Music gazebo. It was here that the most romantic scenes of the Sound of Music was captured; when Liesl gets her first kiss while singing “16 going on 17.” It is also where the Captain and Maria fall deeper in love with each other while singing “Something Good”. Though visitors cannot go into the gazebo, they can dance, sing, and take as many pictures as they please around it. Make your visit to Hellbrunn even more exciting by taking a tour of the Trick Fountains at Hellbrunn Palace. The hour long tour takes you through grottoes, ponds, and walkways filled with trick fountains. Your ticket also lets you explore the inside of the palace. This is one of the best things to do in Salzburg and will be a memorable experience especially for the kids. Leopoldskron Palace is one of the most important filming location for the Sound of Music as the majestic palace and perfect lake view backdrop served as the primary filming location for all of the lake terrace scenes of the Von Trapp family home. This includes the scenes in which Maria and the kids fall off the boat into the lake, and when the Captain and Uncle Max are drinking pink lemonade on the terrace. Though the interior of the mansion was never filmed in the movie, the palace’s gold Venetian ballroom and foyer were rebuilt in Hollywood for the interior scenes. Today the palace is a boutique hotel. Staying overnight is the only way to visit the film location up close and to get a peek into the Venetian ballroom. Staying here is the ultimate Sound of Music experience as you get to live in the home of the Von Trapp family in the film. You can book your stay at Leopoldskron Palace here. If you choose not to stay at the hotel, you can still view the Palace at a distance from the west side of the lake. Though not a filming location, the Von Trapp Villa is where the real Von Trapp family lived for 15 years. They managed to get onto a train at the nearby station to escape the Nazis one day before the Austrian borders were closed. Today the Von Trapp Villa operates as a hotel and an educational Sound of Music museum of the real Von Trapp family as well as behind the scenes information about the filming of the movie. Not far from Leopoldskron Palace, a visit to the Von Trapp Villa would give fans a true insight on the life of the legendary Von Trapp family that we have come to love. Fans can either book a stay at the Villa or simply visit on a guided tour which takes place every day and lasts about 45 minutes. Mt. Untersberg is depicted twice in the Sound of Music, once during the opening scene in which Maria is singing the “Sound of Music” and again when the family is escaping over the mountain to Switzerland while singing “Climb Every Mountain”. Fans can easily access Mount Untersberg from Salzburg via bus and get to the top via cable car. More adventurous travelers can hike 2 hours to the top. At 1,853 meters above the Salzburg basin, Mt. Untersberg offers breaktaking views over the region and is worth the day trip from Salzburg. Less than an hour bus drive from Salzburg is the picturesque lakeside town Mondsee. There you can visit the beautiful Collegiate Church of St. Michael where Maria and Georg von Trapp got married in the movie. This is a must-see for any Sound of Music fan. Make a full-day trip out of the location and stroll through the town, take a refreshing dip in the lake, hike up the nearby forest, and eat delicious seafood along the lake. In the opening scene of the movie you get a gorgeous aerial view of the village of St. Gilgen and the popular lake, Wolfgangsee. The village and lake can easily be reached by train. Want to have a picnic on the hills while singing “Do Re Mi”? then take the “Sound Of Music Trail” and retrace the Von Trapp’s steps up the Gschwandtanger. The short 1.4km hike from the Werfen town takes about half an hour to complete. Once at the top you can enjoy a picnic and breathtaking views of the surrounding areas and the Hohenwerfen Fortress. Make your trip to Werfen a full day adventure by visiting both the Hohenwerfen Fortress and the largest ice cave in the world, Eisriesenwelt. Both sights will be a welcome addition to your Salzburg itinerary. Situated just across the German border, atop the magnificent Rossfeld mountain, is the Rossfeld Panoramic Road which was used in the movie to show the safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain. The private road, Rossfeld Panoramic Road is the only filming location that’s difficult to get to without a car. If you don’t have a car, it is recommended to visit the nearby Untersberg Mountain to get just as spectacular views with easier accessibility. Well there you have it, the top must-visit Sound of Music filming location in and around Salzburg. All locations can be visited on your own, but if you don’t want to deal with the hassle or you have limited time, consider taking a guided Sound of Music tour from Salzburg or Vienna. And to make your Sound of Music trip even more memorable, spend a night or two at the home of the Von Trapp family in the film; Hotel Schloss Leopoldskron, or in the home of the real Von Trapp family at Villa Trapp. Either one will take your trip from amazing to extraordinary. Waseem says 1 month ago The Sound of Music gazebo at Hellbrunn Palace in Salzburg was moved here from its original location at Schloss Leopoldskron. Allan Trivette says 5 months ago The writer/compiler of this page shows an obvious love for the film. I was put under a “Sound of Music” spell at the age of 10 when the film first came out, and I’m still spellbound to this day. I’ve visited Salzburg 5 times, and I can’t wait to go back again. But, there are a few errors on this page that need to be clarified and/or corrected. First – #7 Frohnburg Palace – the writer of this article is correct – it WAS used as the von Trapp home in the film. However, what we see in the film as the FRONT of the von Trapp home is actually the BACK of Frohnburg! The FRONT of Frohnburg was used as the BACK of the von Trapp home in the film! The back of the home is seen when Rolf comes to deliver a telegram and the Captain takes it abruptly and tells him to leave. You see it also when the pink lemonade is served. Now, to make this even more complicated, the back of the film home looking toward the lake: the canoe flipping, the Baroness and the Captain strolling by the lake, Leisl running out to meet Rolf, Maria’s return when she comes back from the Abbey, etc., is located to the left of Schloss Leopoldskron. I’ll write more about this below. #8 – Hellbrun Palace (the gazebo) – correction – NONE of the gazebo scenes (“16 Going on 17” and “Something Good”) were shot anywhere near the gazebo. It was a set in Hollywood. The only time we see the gazebo that is at Hellbrun is when the Captain and the Baroness take their stroll by the lake (just before the canoe flipping). It can be seen briefly in the background during their stroll. #9 – Leopoldskron Palace – was NOT used at ALL at any time during the filming!! The production company DID want to film the lake scenes there, but the officials of the Palace at that time wanted too much money. They did, however, offer the company the use of the “side lawn”. If you look at the photo of the Palace on this page, the side lawn is not seen, but it is to the left of the photo’s edge. The “Official Sound of Music Tour” guides will show you the Schloss and point out the original horse-headed statues and lake gate and tell you that is where those scenes were filmed. WRONG!!! The “lake-gate” and the horse-headed fish statues, were recreated by 20th Century-Fox and erected on the “side lawn” where the Meierhof is now located. The Meierhof used to be the administrative offices for the Palace, but it is now, as is the Schloss itself, available for overnight stays. If one enters the main gate for the Schloss, the Schloss is to the left and the Meierhof is to the right. Walking straight from the gate to the lake one will see the pedestals for the horse-headed statues are still there. As was stated by the writer, the Venetian Room is in the Schloss and was used as the inspiration for the ballroom in the film. #11 – Mount Untersberg – clarification – the mount is seen several times in the background of several scenes, but NO SCENES were filmed ON it. #15 – Rossfeld Mountain – clarification – again, “the safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain” is inaccurate. That “escape” scene was filmed just off the Rossfeld Panoramastrasse. There is a roadside cafe/restaurant on the Panoramastrasse called the Ahornkaser (they serve the best Apple Strudel you’ll ever have). Standing in front of the Ahornkaser, there is a path on the right side of the building. Take that path about 400 feet and look up to your right. At the top of the hill is the exact spot where the von Trapps cross the mountain to freedom as “Climb Ev’ry Mountain” is sung. At the end of that scene, with that open vista lying before them, you can see the Untersberg in the distance. I hope this helps/informs anyone planning on making a visit. Negar Modgeddi says 1 month ago I LOVE your notations about the actual places and your very thoughtful corrections! Melanie says 6 months ago Thank you for this great information! Do you know which field Maria was walking in during the opening scene? I know it was Untersberg Mountain in the background, but I can’t find any information on the field she was frolicking through to get that sweeping view. Any pointers you can offer would be most appreciated! Ben says 6 months ago The opening scene was filmed on Mehlweg meadow which is not open to the public. Frans says 2 years ago The horsepond also features in a scene where Liesl runs into Rolf on his bike. lucy says 2 years ago This has been the most helpful and clear information i’ve found about the filming locations thanks so much Your email address will not be published.

The opening aerial shots are Salzburg’s glorious Lake District, the Salzkammergut. The castles you can see are Kloster Höglwörth, an old monastery on a peninsula in Höglwörther See; and Schloss Anif, off E55 a few miles south of Salzburg. The mountain, atop which Maria (Julie Andrews) makes her first twirling appearance, is Mehlweg, near the Bavarian village of Markt Schellenberg, about six miles from Salzburg. Don’t be too disappointed – the birch trees and the babbling brook were added for the movie. Convent interiors were recreated in the studio, but the exterior really is Maria’s abbey. It’s Nonnberg Abbey, Nonnberg Gasse, where you can visit the courtyard and peek inside the chapel (which looks nothing like the interior recreated back in Hollywood). The film cheats a little with the exterior, too. As you’ll find if you visit, the real Nonnberg Abbey doesn’t look out over the picturesque old town of Salzburg, but to the nondescript southern suburbs. The reverse shot, of Maria leaving the abbey, filmed way across the city on the Humboldt Terrace (seen later in the Do Re Mi number), in front of the Museum of Modern Art, which since 2002 has stood atop Mönchsberg Cliffs on the site of the old Cafe Winkler. As Maria leaves to take up her post with the Von Trapp family, I Have Confidence in Me was filmed in Salzburg’s Old Town, in the Residenzplatz, where you’ll see the Domplatz arches, through which Maria enters, and the Residenz Fountain, in which she splashes. The ‘Villa Von Trapp’ is a combination of two different Salzburg locations. The tree-shaded lane, where Maria alights from the bus, is Hellbrunner Allee, running south from the old town. Here you’ll recognise Schloss Frohnburg, a 17th century country house, now the Mozarteum Music Academy, which was used for the intimidating gates and front entrance of the villa which Maria nervously approaches. The lakeside terrace, though, was filmed at Schloss Leopoldskron, a rococo castle on Leopoldskroner Teich, a small artificial lake on the southwest of the town. You can view Leopoldskron across the lake from König Ludwig Strasse, but it's now – hurrah! – a hotel. Leopoldskron's extravagantly gilt Venetian Room was replicated in the studio in Hollywood. Incidentally, the famous gazebo originally stood on the palace's grounds, when it was a private villa, but was moved to a more accessible location. The real Villa Trapp, by the way, is in Aigen, a suburb just to the southeast of the Old Town of Salzburg. Since 2008, it’s been open as a hotel, Villa Trapp, Traunstraße 34, 5026 Salzburg. There’s a rail service to Bahnhof Aigen. The little footbridge over which the von Trapps skip at the beginning of the My Favourite Things montage of Salzburg is Mozart Steg, north of Mozart Platz. They quickly move on to Domplatz, in front of Salzburger Dom (Salzburg Cathedral); Kapitelschwemme, the Baroque horse pond once used for watering and cleaning horses, in Herbert von Karajan Platz; and the market on Kajetanerplatz, just north of Nonnberg Abbey, where Maria demonstrates her tomato juggling skills. They finally head off for a picnic in the meadow above the village of Werfen, 25 miles south of Salzburg in the Salzach River valley (where you can also visit the castle from wartime action movie Where Eagles Dare). Do-Re-Mi begins at the picnic, returning to Salzburg atop the Monchsberg Cliffs, on Humboldt Terrace which you can reach from the Monchsberg elevator in Anton Neumayrplatz, at the end of the Gstattengasse shopping street, and continuing with a carriage ride south from St Erhard Kirche, the Parish Church of St Erhard, along Nonntaler Hauptstraße, which you’ll find directly beneath Nonnberg Abbey. The number climaxes at Mirabell Gardens, on Schwarzstrasse, over the Salzach River behind Schloss Mirabell, where you’ll find the fountains, statues and, famously, the flight of steps on which the children hop. The Von Trapp gazebo, used for Sixteen Going On Seventeen, once stood in the grounds of Leopoldskron, but constant trespassing resulted in it being moved and reconstructed in the ornamental gardens of Schloss Hellbrunn, Morzger Strasse, toward the south of Salzburg. And another cheat. It was recreated, slightly larger, back at 20th Century-Fox in Hollywood for the interior shots. Maria’s wedding, which took place in Nonnberg Abbey, was filmed in the baroque, twin-towered St Michael’s Church, Wredeplatz, in Mondsee, about 15 miles east of Salzburg on the E55/E60. The Anschluss scene, Austria’s enforced unity with Nazi Germany, was staged back in the centre of Salzburg itself in Residenzplatz. The music festival, at which the von Trapp family perform their disappearing act, is at the Felsenreitschule (‘Rock Riding School’), Hofstallgasse 1, a 1400-seat theatre built in what was a rock quarry for Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun in 1693, and used as the archbishop's riding school. It’s one of the sites of the Salzburg Festival. Despite what some overenthusiastic tour guides might tell you, the cemetery in which the von Trapps hide from the Nazis is a Hollywood studio set, though its design is clearly based on St Peter’s Graveyard, which you can see just off Kapitelplatz. The mountain over which the family finally escapes to freedom is above the village of Obersalzburg with views of the Untersberg in the distance, near the village of Rossfeld, on the 319, 12 miles south of Salzburg. • Many thanks to Lieselotte Mayrhofer; and to Bryan Crawford of Edelweiss Tours for help with this section.

All material Copyright © 2023 The Worldwide Guide To Movie Locations", "‘The Sound of Music’ is easily one of the finest and most appreciated musicals that has managed to transcend cultural boundaries to be a truly universal film, appealing to all people. Adapted from the 1959 stage musical of the same name, ‘The Sound of Music’ is actually based on the memoir, titled ‘The Story of the Trapp Family Singers’. The story deals with a postulant, who goes to the imposing home of a retired naval officer. The man is a widower, and the young woman acts as a governess to his children. Soon enough, she brings music and love to the entire family, and it is not long before she falls in love with her employer as well. Together they band, as they have to face the loss of their motherland to the Nazis. If you have seen the movie, you already know that it takes place in Salzburg in Austria. Over the course of the film, there are several iconic scenes that have been shot at picturesque locations, or there are some locations that have been simply elevated due to the value of the scene itself (think of the gazebo where ‘Sixteen Going on Seventeen’ is performed). Naturally, you might be wondering about the exact filming locations of this popular movie, and we have got you covered in that regard. When ‘The Sound of Music’ started filming, the crew did not head immediately to the real locations for the movie. Instead, when principal photography began on March 26, 1964, it started at the 20th Century Fox studios located in Los Angeles. Following this, the crew headed to Salzburg, where they filmed at a variety of locations including the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and Residence Fountain, among others. Filming commenced here from April 23, to around May 22. Various other locations nearby were used, and shooting went on till around June 19. The crew also hit up places nearby including Werfen in the Salzach River valley. Some scenes were also shot in Bavaria, with the Alps serving as a wonderful backdrop. Around July 6, the team headed back to Los Angeles for the remaining scenes, and principal photography ultimately wrapped up by September 1, 1964. As is evident, a plethora of locations have been hit in this frenzied shooting schedule, and we now proceed to the specific filming locations, rendered memorable by the iconic scenes that have unfolded there. Salzburg in Austria serves as the place where most of the pivotal scenes of ‘The Sound of Music’ take place. Some of the most recognizable locations include Mirabell Palace and Gardens. If you’ve seen the movie, you must know that ‘Do re mi’ is one of the most popular songs. The ending of this song sees Maria and the von Trapp kids at the Mirabell Palace and Gardens. Located in Salzburg’s old town, we can see the movie characters dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, which is located in front of the palace. The other recognizable locations happen to be the rose garden at the north of the fountain and the Greek fencing statues at the entrance. Residenzplatz Square and Fountain also plays an important part, early on, as Maria can be seen splashing in the baroque horse fountain here, while ‘I Have Confidence in Me’ is playing. When Germany annexes Austria, we see Nazi soldiers marching through this square, while a Swastika flag is raised above the Old Residence Palace’s entrance. The Summer Riding School (Felsenreitschule) is where the von Trapp family takes the stage, performing ‘Edelweiss’ and ‘So long, Farewell’, for the Folk Festival. Notably, hundreds of extras were hired for the scene to sing along. A little away from this location, on Herbert von Karajan Square, is the Horse Pond, where Maria and the children dance at the end of ‘My Favorite Things’. Leopoldskron Palace is important in its own way since all the lake terrace scenes of the von Trapp family home were shot here. Schloss Frohnburg was also used to show the von Trapp house, rather the intimidating front gates which Maria nervously approaches initially. Nonnberg Abbey Convent is where Maria lived, and the exteriors of the same have been used in the movie. However, the movie has taken some liberties here, as the convent does not actually look over the old town of Salzburg, but instead has a view of the nondescript southern suburbs. St. Michael Basilica in Mondsee, outside Salzburg, is remarkable because Maria gets married to Georg von Trapp, in one of the most famous scenes from the movie. Werfen, which is around a 40-minute drive away from Salzburg, has the Gschwandtanger Meadow, which is famous for being the picnic spot where Maria teaches the kids the lyrics of ‘Do re mi’. Bavaria is important for being one of the first scenes where Maria makes her entrance. She can be seen twirling at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg. The sequence where the von Trapps escape the Nazis is also shot on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. Notably, Stage 8 and Stage 15 were used in the studios, but a lot of important scenes were shot there. Firstly, shooting inside the convent was not allowed, meaning that the set was created in the studio itself. The golden foyer and the ballroom, we see in the house, were also recreated in Hollywood. There is an important scene where the Von Trapp family hides from the Nazis behind some tombs. While the scenes have been recreated in Hollywood, they closely resemble St. Peter’s Cemetery and Catacombs in Salzburg. The gazebo where two of the finest songs in ‘The Sound of Music’ take place, that is, ‘Something Good’ and ’16 going on 17′, is actually both a real-life location as well as something created in a studio. The real-life gazebo is near the Eastern entrance to the Hellbrunn Palace. A larger one was rebuilt in Hollywood where most of the scenes were actually shot. As is evident, the scenes in ‘The Sound of Music’ have been carefully shot to capture the beauty of the location and to transport us into this enchanting world inhabited by the von Trapp family and Maria. Making the best use of the locations is just one small aspect that has helped this film go down in history as one of the most memorable examples of great cinema.

Powered by WordPress.com VIP.", "The Sound of Music is a 1965 American musical drama film produced and directed by Robert Wise from a screenplay written by Ernest Lehman, and starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, with Richard Haydn, Peggy Wood, Charmian Carr, and Eleanor Parker. The film is an adaptation of the 1959 stage musical, composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and a book by Lindsay and Crouse. Based on the 1949 memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria von Trapp, the film is set in Salzburg, Austria and is a fictional retelling of her experiences as governess to seven children, her eventual marriage with their father Captain Georg Von Trapp, and their escape during the Anschluss in 1938.[4] Filming took place from March to September 1964 in Los Angeles and Salzburg. The Sound of Music was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited roadshow theatrical release. Although initial critical response to the film was mixed, it was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office film after four weeks, and the highest-grossing film of 1965. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all-time—surpassing Gone with the Wind—and held that distinction for five years. The film was just as popular throughout the world, breaking previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries. Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years, and two successful re-releases, the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286 million. The Sound of Music received five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Wise's second pair of both awards, the first being from the 1961 film West Side Story.[5] The film also received two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture and Best Actress, the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. In 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) listed The Sound of Music as the fifty-fifth greatest American film of all time, and the fourth-greatest film musical. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg in 1938. Her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern. Mother Abbess sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children—Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children out of drapes that are to be changed. She takes them around Salzburg and the mountains while teaching them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake which concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain attempts to fire Maria. However, he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. The Captain apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay. Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes that he enters them in the upcoming Salzburg Festival, but the Captain disapproves of letting his children sing in public. During a grand party at the villa, where guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional Ländler folk dance, he steps in and partners Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy by indirectly convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. However, Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, so she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her purpose in life. When Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. However, the Baroness learns that the Captain's feelings for Maria haven't changed, so she peacefully calls off the engagement and returns to Vienna while encouraging the Captain to express his feelings for Maria, who marries him. While the couple is on their honeymoon, Max enters the children into the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. Having learned that Austria has been annexed by the Third Reich, the couple return to their home, where the Captain receives a telegram, ordering him to report to the German Naval base at Bremerhaven to accept a commission in the Kriegsmarine. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and their ideology, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. That night, the von Trapp family attempt to flee to Switzerland, but they are stopped by a group of Brownshirts, led by the Gauleiter Hans Zeller, waiting outside the villa. To cover his family's tracks, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven. Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slips away and seeks shelter at the abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Zeller and his men soon arrive and search the abbey, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When they attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start, as two of the nuns have sabotaged their engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom. The real Maria von Trapp has a brief uncredited cameo as a passerby, alongside her children Rosmarie and Werner von Trapp during \"I Have Confidence\".[7] The Sound of Music story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, published in 1949 to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband Georg in 1947.[8] Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told.[8] In 1956, German producer Wolfgang Liebeneiner purchased the film rights for $9,000 (equivalent to $97,000 in 2022), hired George Hurdalek and Herbert Reinecker to write the screenplay, and Franz Grothe to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional Austrian folk songs.[9] The Trapp Family was released in West Germany on October 9, 1956, and became a major success.[8] Two years later, Liebeneiner directed a sequel, The Trapp Family in America, and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years.[8] Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America.[8] In 1956, Paramount Pictures purchased the United States film rights, intending to produce an English-language version with Audrey Hepburn as Maria.[8] The studio eventually dropped its option, but one of its directors, Vincent J. Donehue, proposed the story as a stage musical for Mary Martin.[8] Producers Richard Halliday and Leland Heyward secured the rights and hired playwrights Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, who had won the Pulitzer Prize for State of the Union.[9] They approached Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II to compose one song for the musical, but the composers felt the two styles—traditional Austrian folk songs and their composition—would not work together.[9] They offered to write a completely new score for the entire production if the producers were willing to wait while they completed work on Flower Drum Song.[10] The producers quickly responded that they would wait as long as necessary.[10] The Sound of Music stage musical opened on November 16, 1959, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York City and ran on Broadway for 1,443 performances, winning six Tony Awards, including Best Musical.[11] In June 1960, Twentieth Century-Fox purchased the film adaptation rights to the stage musical for $1.25 million (equivalent to $12,400,000 in 2022) against ten percent of the gross.[12][Note 1] In December 1962, 20th Century-Fox president Richard D. Zanuck hired Ernest Lehman to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of the stage musical.[13] Lehman reviewed the original script for the stage musical, rearranged the sequence of songs, and began transforming a work designed for the stage into a film that could use the camera to emphasize action and mood and open the story up to the beautiful locations of Salzburg and the Austrian Alps.[14] The \"Do-Re-Mi\" sequence in the play, for example, was originally a stagnant number; Lehman transformed it into a lively montage showing some of the beautiful sites of Salzburg, as well as showing Maria and the children growing closer over time.[14] Lehman also eliminated two songs, \"How Can Love Survive?\" and \"No Way to Stop It\", sung by the characters of Elsa and Max.[14] In January 1963, he saw the Fox English-dubbed version of the two German films. Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material.[15] While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director. Their first choice was Robert Wise, with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of West Side Story, but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, The Sand Pebbles.[16] Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including Stanley Donen, Vincent J. Donehue, George Roy Hill, and Gene Kelly.[17] In January 1963, Lehman invited one of his favorite directors, William Wyler, to travel to New York City with him to see the Broadway musical. After seeing the show, Wyler said he hated it, but after two weeks of Lehman's persuasion, Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film.[18] After hiring musical supervisor Roger Edens, Wyler, Lehman, and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations.[19] In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy-five locations—an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences.[20] During that trip, Lehman began to have reservations about Wyler's commitment to the project and communicated this to Zanuck, who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible.[21] Lehman completed the first draft on September 10, 1963, and sent it to Wyler, who had no suggestions or changes to add.[21] At that time, Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise, whom Lehman still wanted as the director.[21] Later that month, Wyler's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct The Collector. Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film, and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director, ending Wyler's participation.[21] Meanwhile, Wise, whose film The Sand Pebbles had been postponed, read Lehman's first draft, was impressed by what he read, and agreed to direct the film,[22] joining the picture in October 1963,[23] and flew to Salzburg with associate producer Saul Chaplin and members of his production team to scout filming locations, including many that Wyler had identified.[24] When he returned, Wise began working on the script. Wise shared Lehman's vision of the film being centered on the music, and the changes he made were consistent with the writer's approach—mainly reducing the amount of sweetness and sentimentality found in the stage musical.[23] He had reservations about Lehman's opening aerial sequence because West Side Story, whose screenplay Lehman had also written, had used a similar opening sequence, but he was unable to think of a better one and decided to keep Lehman's.[23] Other changes included replacing \"An Ordinary Couple\" with a more romantic number, and a new song for Maria's departure from the abbey—Rodgers provided \"Something Good\" and \"I Have Confidence\", especially for the film.[25] Lehman completed the second draft on December 20, 1963,[26] but additional changes would be made based on input from Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer about the character of the Captain. Plummer especially helped change a character lacking substance into a stronger, more forceful complex figure with a wry sense of humor and a darker edge.[27] Lehman completed his final draft on March 20, 1964.[28] Lehman's first and only choice for Maria was Julie Andrews.[29] When Wise joined the project, he made a list of his choices for the role, which included Andrews as his first choice, Grace Kelly, and Shirley Jones.[30] Wise and Lehman went to Disney Studios to view footage from Mary Poppins, which was not yet released. A few minutes into the film, Wise told Lehman, \"Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this film and grabs her!\"[29] Andrews had some reservations—mainly about the amount of sweetness in the theatrical version—but when she learned that her concerns were shared by Wise and Lehman and what their vision was, she signed a contract with Fox to star in The Sound of Music and one other film for $225,000 (equivalent to $2,120,000 in 2022).[31] Wise had a more difficult time casting the role of the Captain. A number of actors were considered for the part, including Bing Crosby, Yul Brynner, Sean Connery, and Richard Burton.[32] Wise had seen Christopher Plummer on Broadway and wanted him for the role, but the stage actor turned down the offer several times. Wise flew to London to meet with Plummer and explained his concept of the film; the actor accepted after being assured that he could work with Lehman to improve the character.[33] Wise also spent considerable time and effort on casting the secondary characters. For the role of Max Detweiler, Wise initially considered Victor Borge, Noël Coward, and Hal Holbrook among others before deciding on Richard Haydn.[33] For the character of Baroness Elsa Schraeder, Wise looked for a \"name\" actress—Andrews and Plummer were not yet widely known to film audiences—and decided on Eleanor Parker.[34] The casting of the children's characters began in November 1963 and involved over two hundred interviews and auditions throughout the United States and England.[35] Some of the child actors interviewed or tested, who were not selected, included Mia Farrow, Patty Duke, Lesley Ann Warren, Geraldine Chaplin, Shelley Fabares, Teri Garr, Kurt Russell, and The Osmonds.[36] Most of the actors selected had some acting, singing, or dancing experience. Charmian Carr, however, was a model who worked part-time in a doctor's office and had no ambition to pursue a career as an actress.[37] After a friend sent her photo to Wise's office, she was asked to interview. Wise later recalled, \"She was so pretty and had such poise and charm that we liked her immediately.\"[37] The last person to be cast was Daniel Truhitte in the role of Rolfe.[37] Rehearsals for the singing and dance sequences began on February 10, 1964.[38] The husband-and-wife team of Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, who had worked with Andrews on Mary Poppins, worked out the choreography with Saul Chaplin on piano—the arrangements could not be altered under Rodgers and Hammerstein's contract.[39] The stage choreography was not used because it was too restrictive.[40] Breaux and Wood worked out all-new choreography better suited for the film that incorporated many of the Salzburg locations and settings.[40] They even choreographed the newly added puppet dance sequence for \"The Lonely Goatherd\".[41] The choreography for the Ländler strictly followed the traditional Austrian folk dance.[40] The musical arranger Irwin Kostal prerecorded the songs with a large orchestra and singers on a stage before the start of filming.[42] In her book, The Sound of Music: The Making of America's Favorite Movie, Julia Antopol Hirsch says that Kostal used seven children and five adults to record the children's voices; the only scene in which the child-actors' singing is heard in the released version of the film is when they sing \"The Sound of Music\" on their own after Maria leaves.[43] Charmian Carr refuted the claim that the voices of the child actors were dubbed in the film and on the soundtrack. Carr contended that all of the children who are in the film sing on the track, but four other children were added to most of the songs to give them a fuller sound; they did not replace them as singers.[44] The voices of some of the adult actors had voice doubles, including those of Peggy Wood and Christopher Plummer.[45] Principal photography began on March 26, 1964, at 20th Century-Fox studios in Los Angeles, where scenes from Maria's bedroom and the abbey cloister and graveyard were filmed.[46] The company then flew to Salzburg, where filming resumed on April 23 at Mondsee Abbey for the wedding scenes.[47] From April 25 through May 22, scenes were filmed at the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, Residence Fountain, and various street locations throughout the Altstadt (Old Town) area of the city.[47] Wise faced opposition from city leaders who did not want him staging scenes with swastika banners. They relented after he threatened instead to include old newsreel footage featuring the banners.[48] On days when it rained, a constant challenge for the company,[49] Wise arranged for scenes to be shot at St. Margarethen Chapel and Dürer Studios (Reverend Mother's office).[50] From May 23 to June 7, the company worked at Schloss Leopoldskron and an adjacent property called Bertelsmann for scenes representing the lakeside terrace and gardens of the von Trapp villa.[51] From June 9 to 19, scenes were shot at Frohnburg Palace, which represented the front and back façades of the villa.[51] Karath could not swim and was in danger during the capsizing boat scene.[52] The \"Do-Re-Mi\" picnic scene in the mountains was filmed above the town of Werfen in the Salzach River valley on June 25 and 27.[51] The opening sequence of Maria on her mountain was filmed from June 28 to July 2 at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg in Bavaria.[53][Note 2] During filming, Birch trees were added and then removed. The brook she walks through was plastic filled with water which was put there during filming.[54] The final scene of the von Trapp family escaping over the mountains was filmed on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps.[55] The cast and crew flew back to Los Angeles and resumed filming at Fox Studios on July 6 for all remaining scenes, including those in the villa dining room, ballroom, terrace, living room, and gazebo.[56] Following the last two scenes shot in the gazebo—for the songs \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\"—principal photography concluded on September 1, 1964.[56] A total of eighty-three scenes were filmed in just over five months.[57] Post-production work began on August 25 with three weeks of dialogue dubbing to correct lines that were ruined by various street noises and rain.[58] In October, Christopher Plummer's singing voice was dubbed by veteran Disney playback singer Bill Lee.[59] The film was then edited by Wise and film editor William Reynolds.[60] Once the film was edited, Irwin Kostal, who orchestrated the musical numbers, underscored the film with background music consisting of variations on Rodgers and Hammerstein's original songs to amplify or add nuances to the visual images.[59][60] When dubbing, editing, and scoring were complete, Wise arranged for two sneak-preview showings—the first one held in Minneapolis on Friday, January 15, 1965[61] at the Mann Theater, and the second one held the following night in Tulsa.[62] Despite the \"sensational\" responses from the preview audiences, Wise made a few final editing changes before completing the film.[62] According to the original print information for the film, the running time for the theatrical release version was 174 minutes.[1] The film was still in release when the Motion Picture Association of America's film ratings system was implemented in 1968,[63] and was subsequently given a \"G\" rating (\"general audiences\") in 1969.[1] The Sound of Music was filmed in Todd-AO by Ted McCord and produced with DeLuxe Color processing.[64] Aerial footage was photographed with an MCS-70 camera.[64] The sound was recorded on a 70 mm six-track using a Westrex recording system.[1][64] The sets used for the film were based on the storyboards of sketch artist Maurice Zuberano,[65] who accompanied Wise to Austria to scout filming locations in November 1963.[66] Wise met with the artist over ten weeks and explained his objective for each scene—the feeling he wanted to convey and the visual images he wanted to use.[65] When Zuberano was finished, he provided Wise with a complete set of storyboards that illustrated each scene and set—storyboards the director used as guidance during filming.[65] Zuberano's storyboards and location photos were also used by art director Boris Leven to design and construct all of the original interior sets at Fox studios, as well as some external sets in Salzburg.[67] The von Trapp villa, for example, was actually filmed in several locations: the front and back façades of the villa were filmed at Frohnburg Palace, the lakeside terrace and gardens was a set constructed on a property adjacent to Schloss Leopoldskron called Bertelsmann, and the interior was a constructed set at Fox Studios.[68] The gazebo scenes for \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" were filmed on a larger reconstructed set at Fox studios, while some shots of the original gazebo were filmed on the grounds at Schloss Leopoldskron in Salzburg.[69][70][Note 3] Most of the soundtrack to The Sound of Music was written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and arranged and conducted by Irwin Kostal, who also adapted the instrumental underscore passages.[71][72] Both the lyrics and music for two new songs were written by Rodgers, as Hammerstein died in 1960.[73] The soundtrack album was released by RCA Victor in 1965 and is one of the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 20 million copies worldwide.[74][75] The album reached the number one position on the Billboard 200 that year in the United States.[76][77] It remained in the top ten for 109 weeks, from May 1, 1965, to July 16, 1967,[78][79] and remained on the Billboard 200 chart for 238 weeks.[76] The album was the best-selling album in the United Kingdom in 1965, 1966, and 1968 and the second best-selling of the entire decade, spending a total of 70 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart.[80] It also stayed 73 weeks on the Norwegian charts, becoming the seventh best-charting album of all time in that country.[81] In 2015, Billboard named the album the second greatest album of all time.[82][83] The album has been reissued several times, including anniversary editions with additional tracks in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015.[77] Wise hired Mike Kaplan to direct the publicity campaign for the film.[84] After reading the script, Kaplan decided on the ad line \"The Happiest Sound in All the World\", which would appear on promotional material and artwork.[84] Kaplan also brought in outside agencies to work with the studio's advertising department to develop the promotional artwork, eventually selecting a painting by Howard Terpning of Andrews on an alpine meadow with her carpetbag and guitar case in hand with the children and Plummer in the background.[85][86][Note 4] In February 1964, Kaplan began placing ads in the trade papers Daily Variety, Weekly Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter to attract future exhibitor interest in the project.[84] The studio intended the film to have an initial roadshow theatrical release in select large cities in theaters that could accommodate the 70-mm screenings and six-track stereophonic sound.[87] The roadshow concept involved two showings a day with reserved seating and an intermission similar to Broadway musicals.[87] Kaplan identified forty key cities that would likely be included in the roadshow release and developed a promotional strategy targeting the major newspapers of those cities.[85] During the Salzburg production phase, 20th Century-Fox organized press junkets for American journalists to interview Wise and his team and the cast members.[85] \"No one is comfortable with an excess of hearts and flowers, but there is no valid reason for hiding honest emotion. This has always been a major element in the theatre, and it's my conviction that anyone who can't, on occasion, be sentimental about children, home or nature is sadly maladjusted.\"[88] Richard Rodgers The film had its opening premiere on March 2, 1965, at the Rivoli Theater in New York City.[89][90] Initial reviews were mixed.[91] Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's \"romantic nonsense and sentiment\", the children's \"artificial roles\", and Robert Wise's \"cosy-cum-corny\" direction.[92] Judith Crist, in a biting review in the New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as \"icky sticky\" and designed for \"the five to seven set and their mommies\".[89] In her review for McCall's magazine, Pauline Kael called the film \"the sugar-coated lie people seem to want to eat\", and that audiences have \"turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs.\"[93][Note 5] Wise later recalled, \"The East Coast, intellectual papers and magazines destroyed us, but the local papers and the trades gave us great reviews\".[87] Indeed, reviewers such as Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \"three hours of visual and vocal brilliance\",[87] and Variety called it \"a warmly-pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast\".[87] The \"wildly mixed film reviews\" reflected the critical response to the stage musical, according to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical.[95] After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10, The Sound of Music opened in 131 theaters in the United States, including a limited number of roadshow events.[87] After four weeks, the film became the number one box office movie in the country and held that position for thirty out of the next forty-three weeks in 1965.[96] The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years.[96] A few months after its United States release, The Sound of Music opened in 261 theaters in other countries, the first American movie to be completely dubbed in a foreign language, both dialogue, and music.[97] The German, French, Italian, and Spanish versions were completely dubbed, the Japanese version had Japanese dialogue with English songs, and other versions were released with foreign subtitles. The film was a popular success in every country it opened, except the two countries where the story originated, Austria and Germany.[98] In these two countries, the film had to compete with the much-loved Die Trapp-Familie (1956), which provided the original inspiration for the Broadway musical, and its sequel Die Trapp-Familie in Amerika (1958); both films are still widely popular in German-speaking Europe and considered the authoritative von Trapp story.[98] Austrians took exception to the liberties taken by the filmmakers with regard to the costumes, which did not reflect the traditional style and the replacement of traditional Austrian folk songs with Broadway show tunes.[98] The film's Nazi theme was especially unpopular in Germany, where the Munich branch manager for 20th Century-Fox approved the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act of the film following the wedding sequence—the scenes showing Salzburg following the Anschluss. Robert Wise and the studio intervened, the original film was restored, and the branch manager was fired.[99] The Sound of Music holds an 84% \"Certified Fresh\" score on Rotten Tomatoes based on seventy-four reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's consensus states: \"Unapologetically sweet and maybe even a little corny, The Sound of Music will win over all but the most cynical filmgoers with its classic songs and irresistible warmth.\"[100] On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on eleven critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[101] The Sound of Music is one of the most commercially successful films of all time.[102] Four weeks after its theatrical release, it became the number one box office movie in the United States,[103] from revenue generated by twenty-five theaters, each screening only ten roadshow performances per week.[96] It held the number one position for thirty of the next forty-three weeks,[96] and ended up the highest-grossing film of 1965.[104] One contributing factor in the film's early commercial success was the repeat business of many filmgoers.[97] In some cities in the United States, the number of tickets sold exceeded the total population.[97][Note 6] By January 1966, the film had earned $20 million in distributor rentals from just 140 roadshow engagements in the United States and Canada.[105] Worldwide, The Sound of Music broke previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries,[106] including the United Kingdom, where it played for a record-breaking three years at the Dominion Theatre in London[107] and earned £4 million in rentals and grossed £6 million—more than twice as much as any other film had taken in.[106] It was also a major success in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, where it played for as long as two years at some theaters. It was not a universal success, however, with the film only enjoying modest success in France and it was a flop in Germany. It also initially performed poorly in Italy, but a re-release after the Oscars brought better results.[108] It was number one at the US box office for a further 11 weeks in 1966, for a total of 41 weeks at number one. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all time, with over $67.5 million in worldwide rentals ($125 million in gross receipts),[106] surpassing Gone with the Wind, which held that distinction for twenty-four years.[109][Note 7] It was still in the top ten at the US box office in its 100th week of release.[110] The Sound of Music completed its initial four-and-a-half year theatrical release run in the United States on Labor Day 1969, the longest initial run for a film in the US, having earned $68,313,000 in rentals in the United States and Canada.[111][108] It played for 142 weeks at the Eglinton Theatre in Toronto.[112] It was the first film to gross over $100 million.[113] By December 1970, it had earned $121.5 million in worldwide rentals, which was over four times higher than the film's estimated break-even point of $29.5 million in rentals.[114] The film was re-released in 1973,[115][116] and increased its North American rentals to $78.4 million.[117] By the end of the 1970s, it was ranked seventh in all-time North American rentals, having earned $79 million.[118] The film's re-release in 1990[116] increased the total North American admissions to 142,415,400—the third-highest number of tickets sold behind Gone with the Wind and Star Wars—and about 283.3 million admissions worldwide.[119][120] The Sound of Music eventually earned a total domestic gross of $163,214,076 and a total worldwide gross of $286,214,076.[121] Adjusted for inflation, the film earned about $2.366 billion at 2014 prices—placing it among the top ten highest-grossing films of all time.[119] The Sound of Music has been included in numerous top film lists from the American Film Institute. The first American television transmission of The Sound of Music was on February 29, 1976, on ABC, which paid $15 million (equivalent to $77,140,351 in 2022) for a one-time only broadcast that became one of the top 20 rated films shown on television to that point[132] with a Nielsen rating of 33.6 and an audience share of 49%.[133] The movie was not shown again until NBC acquired the broadcast rights in June 1977 for $21.5 million for 20 showings over 22 years and telecast the film on February 11, 1979.[134][135] NBC continued to air the film annually for twenty years.[132] During most of its run on NBC, the film was heavily edited to fit a three-hour time slot—approximately 140 minutes without commercials, which inevitably cut 30 minutes out of the original film.[136] The film aired in its uncut form (minus the entr'acte) on April 9, 1995, on NBC. Julie Andrews hosted the four-hour telecast which presented the musical numbers in a letterboxed format. As the film's home video availability cut into its television ratings, NBC let their contract lapse in 2001. That year, the film was broadcast one time on the Fox network, in its heavily edited 140-minute version. Since 2002, the film has aired on ABC on a Sunday night prior to Christmas and has been broadcast on its sister cable network, Freeform, periodically around Easter and other holidays. Most of its more recent runs have been the full version in a four-hour time slot, complete with the entr'acte. ABC first broadcast a high-definition version on December 28, 2008. On December 22, 2013, the annual broadcast had its highest ratings since 2007; the increase in ratings were credited to NBC's broadcast of The Sound of Music Live!—a live television adaptation of the original musical which aired earlier that month.[137] In the United Kingdom, the film rights were acquired by the BBC, who paid a corporation record $4.1 million,[138] and it was first aired on BBC One on 25 December 1978 and, as of December 2016, fifteen times since, mostly around Christmas time. As the BBC channels in Britain are not funded by advertising there was no need to cut scenes to fit within a timeslot and the film was screened in the full 174-minute version without breaks.[139] The film was also intended to be part of the BBC's programming during the outbreak of nuclear war.[140] The film has been released on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD numerous times. The first DVD version was released on August 29, 2000, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the film's release.[141] The film is often included in box sets with other Rodgers & Hammerstein film adaptations.[141] A 40th anniversary DVD, with \"making of\" documentaries and special features, was released on November 15, 2005.[141] The film made its debut issue on Blu-ray Disc on November 2, 2010, for its 45th anniversary.[141][142][143] For the Blu-ray release, the original 70 mm negatives were rescanned at 8K resolution, then restored and remastered at 4K resolution for the transfer to Blu-ray, giving the most detailed copy of the film seen thus far. On March 10, 2015, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released The Sound of Music 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition—a five-disc set featuring thirteen hours of bonus features, including a new documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg.[141][144] A March 2015 episode of ABC's 20/20 entitled The Untold Story of the Sound of Music featured a preview of the documentary and interviews by Diane Sawyer.[145] In part to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, the film was made available on the Disney+ streaming service upon its debut on November 12, 2019.[146] The Sound of Music film adaptation, like the stage musical, presents a history of the von Trapp family (a.k.a. the Trapp Family) that is not completely accurate. The musical was based on the West German film The Trapp Family (1956) rather than Maria von Trapp's 1949 memoirs, as director Vincent J. Donehue had seen the film and decided that it would make a good vehicle for Mary Martin.[147] The musical followed the film's plot so closely that the New York Times review of the West German film noticed that it \"strongly suggests 'The Sound of Music,' often scene by scene.\"[Note 8][148] The West German screenwriters made several significant changes to the family's story that were kept in the musical. Maria had been hired to teach just one child, but the 1956 film made her governess to all seven children.[149] The 1965 film adaptation was influenced by other musicals of its era, such as Mary Poppins, the Rodgers and Hammerstein television production of Cinderella, and the stage production of Lerner and Loewe's Camelot (coincidentally all starring Julie Andrews). Screenwriter Ernest Lehman was inspired by the opening of West Side Story and saw the musical as \"a fairy tale that's almost real\".[150] The film incorporated many \"fairy tale\" tropes which included the idyllic imagery (placed in the hills of Salzburg), the European villas, and the cross-class Cinderella-like romance between Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As Maria walks down the aisle to be married, the pageantry is explicitly both Guinevere and Cinderella.[151] In keeping with this tone the filmmakers used artistic license to convey the essence and meaning of their story. Georg Ludwig von Trapp was indeed an anti-Nazi opposed to the Anschluss, and lived with his family in a villa in a district of Salzburg called Aigen. Their lifestyle depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living. The actual family villa, located at Traunstraße 34, Aigen 5026, was large and comfortable but not nearly as grand as the mansion depicted in the film. The house was also not their ancestral home, as depicted in the film. The family had previously lived in homes in Zell Am See and Klosterneuburg after being forced to abandon their actual ancestral home in Pola following World War I. Georg moved the family to the Salzburg villa shortly after the death of his first wife, Agathe Whitehead, in 1922.[152] Georg is referred to as \"Captain\" in the film, but he held a noble title of \"Ritter\" (hereditary knight), which had higher social status than a naval officer.[153] Although Austrian nobility was legally abolished in 1919 and the nobiliary particle von was proscribed, both continued to be widely used unofficially as a matter of social courtesy.[152] Georg was offered a position in the German Kriegsmarine; Nazi Germany was looking to expand its fleet of U-boats, and Corvette Captain von Trapp was the most successful Austro-Hungarian submarine commander of World War I,[154] having sunk 11 Allied merchant ships totaling 47,653 GRT and two Allied warships displacing a total of 12,641 tons.[155] With his family in desperate financial straits, he seriously considered the offer before deciding he could not serve a Nazi regime.[152] In the film, Georg is depicted initially as a humorless, emotionally distant father. In reality, third child Maria Franziska von Trapp (called \"Louisa\" in the film) described her father as a doting parent who made handmade gifts for the children in his woodshop and who would often lead family musicales on his violin. She has a different recollection of her stepmother, Maria Augusta Kutschera, whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage. In a 2003 interview, Maria remembered, \"[She] had a terrible temper ... and from one moment to the next, you didn't know what hit her. We were not used to this. But we took it like a thunderstorm that would pass, because the next minute she could be very nice.\"[156] Maria Kutschera had indeed been a novice at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and had been hired by the von Trapp family. However, she was hired only to be a tutor to young Maria Franziska, who had come down with scarlet fever and needed her lessons at home, not to be a governess for all of the children. Maria and Georg married for practical reasons, rather than love and affection for each other. Georg needed a mother for his children, and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey. \"I really and truly was not in love,\" Maria wrote in her memoir, \"I liked him but didn't love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children. I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after.\" They were married in 1927, not in 1938 as depicted in the film, and the couple had been married for over a decade by the time of the Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time. Maria and Georg enjoyed a happy marriage.[152] The von Trapp family lost most of its wealth during the worldwide depression of the early 1930s, when the Austrian national bank folded.[152] In order to survive, the family dismissed the servants and began taking in boarders. They also started singing onstage to earn money, a fact that caused the proud Georg much embarrassment.[157] In the film, the von Trapp family hike over the Alps from Austria to Switzerland to escape the Nazis, which would not have been possible; Salzburg is over two hundred miles from Switzerland. The von Trapp villa, however, was only a few kilometers from the Austria–Germany border, and the final scene shows the family hiking on the Obersalzberg near the German town of Berchtesgaden, within sight of Adolf Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus Eagle's Nest retreat. In reality, the family simply walked to the local train station and boarded a train to Italy. The Trapps were entitled to Italian citizenship since Georg had been born in Zadar, Dalmatia, Austria-Hungary, which had been annexed by Italy after World War I. They were able to emigrate to the United States via the United Kingdom on their Italian passports.[Note 9][152] The fictional character Max Detweiler, who acted as the scheming family music director in the film, is based on the von Trapps' family priest, the Reverend Franz Wasner, who was their musical director for over twenty years and, unlike Max, accompanied them when they left Austria.[152] The character of Friedrich, the second oldest child in the film version, was based on Rupert, the oldest of the real von Trapp children. Liesl, the oldest child in the film, was based on Agathe von Trapp, the second oldest in the real family. The names and ages of the children were changed, in part because the third child, who would be portrayed as \"Louisa\", was also named Maria, and producers thought that it would be confusing to have two characters called Maria in the film.[152] The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers.[152] Robert Wise met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to Richard Zanuck, that he was not making a \"documentary or realistic movie\" about her family, and that he would make the film with \"complete dramatic freedom\" in order to produce a \"fine and moving film\", one they could all be proud of.[158] Although The Sound of Music is set in Salzburg, it was largely ignored in Austria upon release. The film adaptation was a blockbuster worldwide, but it ran for only three days in Salzburg movie theaters, with locals showing \"disdain\" for a film that \"wasn't authentic.\"[159] In 1966, American Express created the first Sound of Music guided tour in Salzburg.[160] Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been the leading Sound of Music bus tour company in the city, taking approximately 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region.[160] Although the Salzburg tourism industry took advantage of the attention from foreign tourists, residents of the city were apathetic about \"everything that is dubious about tourism.\"[161] The guides on the bus tour \"seem to have little idea of what really happened on the set.\"[162] Even the ticket agent for the Sound of Music Dinner Show tried to dissuade Austrians from attending a performance that was intended for American tourists, saying that it \"does not have anything to do with the real Austria.\"[163] By 2007, The Sound of Music was drawing 300,000 visitors a year to Salzburg,[164] more than the city's self-conception as the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.[162][165] A German translation of the musical was performed on the national stage for the first time in 2005 at the Vienna Volksoper, receiving negative reviews from Austrian critics, who called it \"boring\" and referred to \"Edelweiss\" as \"an insult to Austrian musical creation.\"[166] The musical finally premiered in Salzburg in 2011 at the Salzburger Landestheater,[167] but Maria was played in the Salzburg premiere by a Dutch actress who \"grew up with the songs.\"[168] However, most performances in Vienna and Salzburg were sold out,[166][167] and the musical is now in both companies' repertoire. A Sing-along Sound of Music revival screening was first shown at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 1999,[169] leading to a successful run at the Prince Charles Cinema which is ongoing as of 2018.[80][170] During the screenings, audience members are often dressed as nuns and von Trapp children and are encouraged to sing along to lyrics superimposed on the screen.[170] In July 2000, Sing-along Sound of Music shows opened in Boston, Massachusetts, and Austin, Texas.[170] Some audience members dressed up as cast members and interacted with the action shown on the screen.[170] The film began a successful run at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City in September 2000, with the opening attended by cast members Charmian Carr (Liesl), Daniel Truhitte (Rolfe), and Kym Karath (Gretl).[171] Sing-along Sound of Music screenings have since become an international phenomenon.[172] In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[102] The Academy Film Archive preserved The Sound of Music in 2003.[173] Subsequently composed (musical/film only, not by original group): Subsequently composed (musical/film only, not by original group):"]}

It is called field hockey to distinguish it from the similar game played on ice. Hockey is believed to date from the earliest civilizations. The Arabs, Greeks, Persians, and Romans each had their own versions, and traces of a stick game played by the Aztec Indians of South America have been found. Hockey can also be identified with other early games, such as hurling and shinty. During the Middle Ages a French stick game called hoquet was played, and the English word may be derived from it. Hockey began to be played in English schools in the late 19th century, and the first men’s hockey club, at Blackheath in southeastern London, recorded a minute book in 1861. Teddington, another London club, introduced several major variations, including the ban of using hands or lifting sticks above the shoulder, the replacement of the rubber cube by a sphere as the ball, and most importantly, the adopting of a striking circle, which was incorporated into the rules of the newly founded Hockey Association in London in 1886. The British army was largely responsible for spreading the game, particularly in India and the Far East. International competition began in 1895. By 1928 hockey had become India’s national game, and in the Olympic Games that year the Indian team, competing for the first time, won the gold medal without conceding a goal in five matches. It was the start of India’s domination of the sport, an era that ended only with the emergence of Pakistan in the late 1940s. The call for more international matches led to the introduction in 1971 of the World Cup. Other major international tournaments include the Asian Cup, Asian Games, European Cup, and Pan-American Games. Men’s field hockey was included in the Olympic Games in 1908 and 1920 and then permanently from 1928. Indoor hockey, played by teams of six players with six interchanging substitutes, has become popular in Europe. Despite the restrictions on sports for ladies during the Victorian era, hockey became increasingly popular among women. Although women’s teams had played regular friendly games since 1895, serious international competition did not begin until the 1970s. The first Women’s World Cup was held in 1974, and women’s hockey became an Olympic event in 1980. The international governing body, the International Federation of Women’s Hockey Associations, was formed in 1927. The game was introduced into the United States in 1901 by Constance M.K. Applebee, and field hockey subsequently became a popular outdoor team sport among women there, being played in schools, colleges, and clubs. The game is played by two teams of 11 players on a rectangular ground. The field is 100 yards (91.4 metres) long and 60 yards (55 metres) wide, and it is marked with a centre line and two 25-yard lines. The goals are 4 yards (3.66 metres) wide and 7 feet (2.13 metres) high. For a goal (which counts for one point) to be scored, the ball must go into the goal and, while within the shooting circle (semicircle), must have been touched by the stick of an attacker. The ball was originally a cricket ball (cork centre, string-wound, and covered with leather), but plastic balls are also approved. It is about 9 inches (23 cm) in circumference. The stick is usually 36 to 38 inches (about 1 metre) long and weighs 12 to 28 ounces (340 to 790 grams). Only the flat left side of the stick may be used to strike the ball. The usual composition of a team is five forwards, three halfbacks, two fullbacks, and a goalkeeper. A game consists of two halves of 35 minutes each, with an intermission of 5–10 minutes. A time-out is called only in case of injury. The goalkeeper wears thick, yet lightweight pads and, while in the shooting circle, is allowed to kick the ball or stop it with the foot or the body. All other players, however, may stop the ball with the stick only. Play is started (and restarted after a goal is scored and after half-time) by a pass-back in the centre of the field. A face-off, or bully, is used to restart the game after an injury or equipment time-out, following simultaneous penalties by both teams, or when the ball becomes trapped in a player’s clothing. In a face-off two players, one from each team, face each other with the ball on the ground between them. After alternately tapping the ground and then his opponent’s stick three times, each player tries to strike the ball, thus putting it into play. There are various provisions for putting the ball into play in case it goes off the field. There are various fouls in field hockey. The off-side rule, which is designed to prevent a player from getting an advantage by staying up the field ahead of the ball and ahead of fewer than two members of the opposing team, was dropped after the 1996 Olympics. Raising the stick above the shoulder while playing the ball is illegal. Stopping the ball with the hand is a foul, as is stopping it with the body or foot. Causing a dangerous play by raising the ball by undercutting it, as well as hooking an opponent’s stick, are also fouls. Finally, there is the obstruction rule: a player is not permitted to obstruct an opponent by putting his stick or any part of his body between the opponent and the ball or by running between the opponent and the ball. Most fouls are penalized by giving the opposition a free hit from the point of infraction. There is one umpire for each half of the field. Results of the men’s field hockey World Cup are provided in the table. Results of the women’s field hockey World Cup are provided in the table.", "Field hockey (or simply hockey) is a team sport structured in standard hockey format, in which each team plays with 10 players in total, made up of 9 outfield players and a goalkeeper. Teams must move a hockey ball around a pitch by hitting it with a hockey stick towards the rival team's shooting circle and then into the goal. The match is won by the team that scores the most goals. Matches are played on grass, watered turf, artificial turf, or indoor boarded surface. The stick is made of wood, carbon fibre, fibreglass and carbon, or a combination of carbon fibre and fibreglass in different quantities. The stick has two sides; one rounded and one flat; only the flat face of the stick is allowed to progress the ball. During play, goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with any part of their body. A player's hand is considered part of the stick if holding the stick. If the ball is \"played\" with the rounded part of the stick (i.e. deliberately stopped or hit), it will result in a penalty (accidental touches are not an offence if they do not materially affect play). Goalkeepers often have a different design of stick; they also cannot play the ball with the round side of their stick. The modern game was developed at public schools in 19th century England and it is now played globally.[1] The governing body is the International Hockey Federation (FIH), called the Fédération Internationale de Hockey in French. Men and women are represented internationally in competitions including the Olympic Games, World Cup, FIH Pro League, Junior World Cup and in past also World League, Champions Trophy. Many countries run extensive junior, senior, and masters club competitions. The FIH is also responsible for organizing the Hockey Rules Board and developing the sport's rules. The sport is known simply as \"hockey\" in countries where it is the more common form of hockey. The term \"field hockey\" is used primarily in Canada and the United States, where \"hockey\" more often refers to ice hockey. In Sweden, the term landhockey is used. A popular variant is indoor field hockey, which differs in a number of respects while embodying the primary principles of hockey. According to the International Hockey Federation (FIH), \"the roots of hockey are buried deep in antiquity\".[2] There are historical records which suggest early forms of hockey were played in Egypt and Persia c. 2000 BC, and in Ethiopia c. 1000 BC. Later evidence suggest that the ancient Greeks, Romans and Aztecs all played hockey-like games.[2] In Ancient Egypt, there is a depiction of two figures playing with sticks and ball in the Beni Hasan tomb of Khety, an administrator of Dynasty XI.[3] In Ancient Greece, there is a similar image dated c. 510 BC, which may have been called Κερητίζειν (kerētízein) because it was played with a horn (κέρας, kéras in Ancient Greek) and a ball.[4] Researchers disagree over how to interpret this image. It could have been a team or one-on-one activity (the depiction shows two active players, and other figures who may be team-mates awaiting a face-off, or non-players waiting for their turn at play). Billiards historians Stein and Rubino believe it was among the games ancestral to lawn-and-field games like hockey and ground billiards, and near-identical depictions appear in later European illuminated manuscripts and other works of the 14th through 17th centuries, showing contemporary courtly and clerical life.[3] In East Asia, a similar game was entertained, using a carved wooden stick and ball, prior to 300 BC.[5] In Inner Mongolia, China, the Daur people have for about 1,000 years been playing beikou, a game with some similarities to field hockey.[6] A similar field hockey or ground billiards variant, called suigan, was played in China during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644, post-dating the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty).[3] A game similar to field hockey was played in the 17th century in Punjab state in India under name khido khundi (khido refers to the woolen ball, and khundi to the stick).[7] In South America, most specifically in Chile, the local natives of the 16th century used to play a game called Chueca, which also shares common elements with hockey.[8] In Northern Europe, the games of hurling (Ireland) and Knattleikr (Iceland), both team ball games involving sticks to drive a ball to the opponents' goal, date at least as far back as the Early Middle Ages. By the 12th century, a team ball game called la soule or choule, akin to a chaotic and sometimes long-distance version of hockey or rugby football (depending on whether sticks were used in a particular local variant), was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes. Throughout the Middle Ages to the Early Modern era, such games often involved the local clergy or secular aristocracy, and in some periods were limited to them by various anti-gaming edicts, or even banned altogether.[3] Stein and Rubino, among others, ultimately trace aspects of these games both to rituals in antiquity involving orbs and sceptres (on the aristocratic and clerical side), and to ancient military training exercises (on the popular side); polo (essentially hockey on horseback) was devised by the Ancient Persians for cavalry training, based on the local proto-hockey foot game of the region.[3] The word hockey itself has no clear origin. One belief is that it was recorded in 1363 when Edward III of England issued the proclamation: \"Moreover we ordain that you prohibit under penalty of imprisonment all and sundry from such stone, wood and iron throwing; handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games\".[9] The belief is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games \"Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam\". It may be recalled at this point that baculum is the Latin for 'stick', so the reference would appear to be to a game played with sticks. The English historian and biographer John Strype did not use the word \"hockey\" when he translated the proclamation in 1720, and the word 'hockey' remains of unknown origin.[citation needed] The modern game developed at public schools in 19th century England. It is now played globally, particularly in parts of Western Europe, South Asia, Southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and parts of the United States, primarily New England and the mid-Atlantic states.[10][11] The term \"field hockey\" is used primarily in Canada and the United States where \"hockey\" more often refers to ice hockey.[12] In Sweden, the term landhockey is used, and to some degree in Norway, where the game is governed by Norges Bandyforbund.[13] The first known club was formed in 1849 at Blackheath in south-east London, but the modern rules grew out of a version played by Middlesex cricket clubs as a winter activity.[citation needed] Teddington Hockey Club formed the modern game by introducing the striking circle and changing the ball to a sphere from a rubber cube.[14] The Hockey Association was founded in 1876. It lasted just six years, before being revived by nine founding members.[15] The first international competition took place in 1895 (Ireland 3, Wales 0), and the International Rules Board was founded in 1900.[citation needed] Field hockey was played at the Summer Olympics in 1908 and 1920. It was dropped in 1924, leading to the foundation of the Fédération Internationale de Hockey sur Gazon (FIH) as an international governing body by seven continental European nations; and hockey was reinstated as an Olympic game in 1928.[citation needed] Men's hockey united under the FIH in 1970.[citation needed] The two oldest trophies are the Irish Senior Cup, which dates back to 1894, and the Irish Junior Cup, a second XI-only competition[clarification needed] instituted in 1895.[16] In India, the Beighton Cup and the Aga Khan tournament commenced within ten years.[clarification needed] Entering the Olympics in 1928, India won all five games without conceding a goal, and won from 1932 until 1956 and then in 1964 and 1980.[citation needed] Pakistan won in 1960, 1968 and 1984.[citation needed] In the early 1970s, artificial turf began to be used.[citation needed] Synthetic pitches changed most aspects of field hockey, gaining speed. New tactics and techniques such as the Indian dribble developed, followed by new rules to take account. The switch to synthetic surfaces ended Indian and Pakistani domination because artificial turf was too expensive in developing countries.[citation needed] Since the 1970s, Australia, the Netherlands, and Germany have dominated at the Olympics and World Cup stages.[citation needed] Women's field hockey was first played at British universities and schools. The first club, the Molesey Ladies, was founded in 1887.[18] The first national association was the Irish Ladies Hockey Union in 1894,[19] and though rebuffed by the Hockey Association, women's field hockey grew rapidly around the world. This led to the International Federation of Women's Hockey Association (IFWHA) in 1927, though this did not include many continental European countries where women played as sections of men's associations and were affiliated to the FIH.[citation needed] The IFWHA held conferences every three years, and tournaments associated with these were the primary IFWHA competitions. These tournaments were non-competitive until 1975.[citation needed] By the early 1970s, there were 22 associations with women's sections in the FIH and 36 associations in the IFWHA.[citation needed] Discussions started about a common rule book. The FIH introduced competitive tournaments in 1974, forcing the acceptance of the principle of competitive field hockey by the IFWHA in 1973. It took until 1982 for the two bodies to merge, but this allowed the introduction of women's field hockey to the Olympic games from 1980 where, as in the men's game, the Netherlands, Germany, and Australia have been consistently strong. Argentina has emerged as a team to be reckoned with since 2000, winning the world championship in 2002 and 2010 and medals at the last three Olympics.[citation needed] In the United States, field hockey is played predominantly by girls and women. There are few field hockey clubs, most play taking place between high school or college sides. The sport was largely introduced in the U.S. by Constance Applebee, starting with a tour of Seven Sisters colleges in 1901 and continuing through Applebee's 24-year tenure as athletic director of Bryn Mawr College. The strength of college field hockey reflects the impact of Title IX, which mandated that colleges should fund men's and women's games programmes comparably.[citation needed] Hockey has been predominantly played on the East Coast, specifically the Mid-Atlantic in states such as New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia.[citation needed] In recent years,[when?] it has become increasingly played on the West Coast and in the Midwest.[citation needed] In other countries, participation is fairly evenly balanced between men and women. For example, in the 2008–09 season, England Hockey reported 2,488 registered men's teams, 1,969 women's teams, 1,042 boys' teams, 966 girls' teams and 274 mixed teams.[20] In 2006, the Irish Hockey Association reported that the gender split among its players was approximately 65% female and 35% male.[citation needed] In its 2008 census, Hockey Australia reported 40,534 male club players and 41,542 female.[21] Most hockey field dimensions were originally fixed using whole numbers of imperial measures. Metric measurements are now the official dimensions as laid down by the International Hockey Federation (FIH) in the Rules of Hockey.[22] The pitch is a 91.4 m × 55 m (100.0 yd × 60.1 yd) rectangular field. At each end is a goal 2.14 m (7 ft) high and 3.66 m (12 ft) wide, as well as lines across the field 22.90 m (25 yd) from each end-line (generally referred to as the 23-metre lines or the 25-yard lines) and in the center of the field. A spot 0.15 m (6 in) in diameter, called the penalty spot or stroke mark, is placed with its centre 6.40 m (7 yd) from the centre of each goal. The shooting circle is 15 m (16 yd) from the base line. Field hockey goals are made of two upright posts, joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar, with a net positioned to catch the ball when it passes through the goalposts. The goalposts and crossbar must be white and rectangular in shape, and should be 2 in (51 mm) wide and 2–3 in (51–76 mm) deep. Field hockey goals also include sideboards and a backboard, which stand 50 cm (20 in) from the ground. The backboard runs the full 3.66 m (12.0 ft) width of the goal, while the sideboards are 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) deep. Historically the game developed on natural grass turf. In the early 1970s, synthetic grass fields began to be used for hockey, with the first Olympic Games on this surface being held at Montreal in 1976. Synthetic pitches are now mandatory for all international tournaments and for most national competitions. While hockey is still played on traditional grass fields at some local levels and lesser national divisions, it has been replaced by synthetic surfaces almost everywhere in the western world. There are three main types of artificial hockey surface:[23] Since the 1970s, sand-based pitches have been favoured as they dramatically speed up the game. However, in recent years there has been a massive increase in the number of \"water-based\" artificial turfs. Water-based synthetic turfs enable the ball to be transferred more quickly than on sand-based surfaces. It is this characteristic that has made them the surface of choice for international and national league competitions. Water-based surfaces are also less abrasive than sand-based surfaces and reduce the level of injury to players when they come into contact with the surface. The FIH are now[when?] proposing that new surfaces being laid should be of a hybrid variety which require less watering. This is due to the negative ecological effects of the high water requirements of water-based synthetic fields. It has also been stated that the decision to make artificial surfaces mandatory greatly favoured more affluent countries who could afford these new pitches.[24] The game is played between two teams of eleven, 10 field players and one goal keeper, are permitted to be on the pitch at any one time. The remaining players may be substituted in any combination. There is an unlimited number of times a team can sub in and out. Substitutions are permitted at any point in the game, apart from between the award and end of a penalty corner; two exceptions to this rule is for injury or suspension of the defending goalkeeper, which is not allowed when playing with a field keep, or a player can exit the field, but you must wait until after the penalty corner is complete. Play is not stopped for a substitution (except of a goalkeeper), the players leave and rejoin the match simultaneously at the half-way line.[25] Players are permitted to play the ball with the flat of the 'face side' and with the edges of the head and handle of the field hockey stick with the exception that, for reasons of safety, the ball may not be struck 'hard' with a forehand edge stroke, because of the difficulty of controlling the height and direction of the ball from that stroke. The flat side is always on the \"natural\" side for a right-handed person swinging the stick at the ball from right to left. Left-handed sticks are rare, as International Hockey Federation rules forbid their use in a game.[26] To make a strike at the ball with a left-to-right swing the player must present the flat of the 'face' of the stick to the ball by 'reversing' the stick head, i.e. by turning the handle through approximately 180° (while a reverse edge hit would turn the stick head through approximately 90° from the position of an upright forehand stroke with the 'face' of the stick head). Edge hitting of the ball underwent a two-year \"experimental period\", twice the usual length of an \"experimental trial\" and is still a matter of some controversy within the game.[when?] Ric Charlesworth, the former Australian coach, has been a strong critic of the unrestricted use of the reverse edge hit. The 'hard' forehand edge hit was banned after similar concerns were expressed about the ability of players to direct the ball accurately, but the reverse edge hit does appear to be more predictable and controllable than its counterpart. This type of hit is now more commonly referred to as the \"forehand sweep\" where the ball is hit with the flat side or \"natural\" side of the stick and not the rounded edge. Other rules include; no foot-to-ball contact, no use of hands, no obstructing other players, no high back swing, no hacking, and no third party. If a player is dribbling the ball and either loses control and kicks the ball or another player interferes that player is not permitted to gain control and continue dribbling. The rules do not allow the person who kicked the ball to gain advantage from the kick, so the ball will automatically be passed on to the opposing team. Conversely, if no advantage is gained from kicking the ball, play should continue. Players may not obstruct another's chance of hitting the ball in any way. No shoving/using your body/stick to prevent advancement in the other team. Penalty for this is the opposing team receives the ball and if the problem continues, the player can be carded. While a player is taking a free hit or starting a corner the back swing of their hit cannot be too high for this is considered dangerous. Finally there may not be three players touching the ball at one time. Two players from opposing teams can battle for the ball, however if another player interferes it is considered third party and the ball automatically goes to the team who only had one player involved in the third party. A match ordinarily consists of two periods of 35 minutes and a halftime interval of 5 minutes. Other periods and interval may be agreed by both teams except as specified in Regulations for particular competitions.[27] Since 2014, some international games have four 15-minute quarters with 2 minutes break between each quarter and 15 minutes break between quarter two and three.[citation needed] At the 2018 Commonwealth Games, held on the Gold Coast in Brisbane, the hockey games for both men and women had four 15-minute quarters.[citation needed] In December 2018, the FIH announced rule changes that would make 15-minute quarters universal from January 2019. England Hockey confirmed that while no changes would be made to the domestic game mid-season, the new rules would be implemented at the start of the 2019–20 season. However, in July 2019 England Hockey announced that 17.5-minute quarters would only be implemented in elite domestic club games.[28] The game begins with a pass back from the centre-forward usually to the centre-half back from the halfway line. The opposing team cannot try to tackle this play until the ball has been pushed back.[citation needed] The team consists of eleven players, usually aligned as follows: goalkeeper, right fullback, left fullback, three half-backs and five forwards who are right wing, right inner, centre forward, left inner and left wing. These positions can change and adapt throughout the course of the game depending on the attacking and defensive style of the opposition.[29] When hockey positions are discussed, notions of fluidity are very common. Each team can be fielded with a maximum of 11 players and will typically arrange themselves into forwards, midfielders, and defensive players (fullbacks) with players frequently moving between these lines with the flow of play. Each team may also play with:[30] As hockey has a very dynamic style of play, it is difficult to simplify positions to the static formations which are common in association football. Although positions will typically be categorised as either fullback, halfback, midfield/inner or striker, it is important for players to have an understanding of every position on the field. For example, it is not uncommon to see a halfback overlap and end up in either attacking position, with the midfield and strikers being responsible for re-adjusting to fill the space they left. Movement between lines like this is particularly common across all positions. This fluid Australian culture[further explanation needed] of hockey has been responsible for developing an international trend towards players occupying spaces on the field, not having assigned positions. Although they may have particular spaces on the field which they are more comfortable and effective as players, they are responsible for occupying the space nearest them. This fluid approach to hockey and player movement has made it easy for teams to transition between formations such as: \"3 at the back\", \"5 midfields\", \"2 at the front\", and more. When the ball is inside the circle, they are defending and they have their stick in their hand, goalkeepers wearing full protective equipment are permitted to use their stick, feet, kickers or leg guards to propel the ball and to use their stick, feet, kickers, leg guards or any other part of their body to stop the ball or deflect it in any direction including over the back line. Similarly, field players are permitted to use their stick. They are not allowed to use their feet and legs to propel the ball, stop the ball or deflect it in any direction including over the back line. However, neither goalkeepers, or players with goalkeeping privileges are permitted to conduct themselves in a manner which is dangerous to other players by taking advantage of the protective equipment they wear.[30] Neither goalkeepers or players with goalkeeping privileges may lie on the ball, however, they are permitted to use arms, hands and any other part of their body to push the ball away. Lying on the ball deliberately will result in a penalty stroke, whereas if an umpire deems a goalkeeper has lain on the ball accidentally (e.g. it gets stuck in their protective equipment), a penalty corner is awarded. * The action above is permitted only as part of a goal saving action or to move the ball away from the possibility of a goal scoring action by opponents. It does not permit a goalkeeper or player with goalkeeping privileges to propel the ball forcefully with arms, hands or body so that it travels a long distance When the ball is outside the circle they are defending, goalkeepers or players with goalkeeping privileges are only permitted to play the ball with their stick. Further, a goalkeeper, or player with goalkeeping privileges who is wearing a helmet, must not take part in the match outside the 23m area they are defending, except when taking a penalty stroke. A goalkeeper must wear protective headgear at all times, except when taking a penalty stroke. For the purposes of the rules, all players on the team in possession of the ball are attackers, and those on the team without the ball are defenders, yet throughout the game being played you are always \"defending\" your goal and \"attacking\" the opposite goal.[31] The match is officiated by two field umpires. Traditionally each umpire generally controls half of the field, divided roughly diagonally. These umpires are often assisted by a technical bench including a timekeeper and record keeper. Prior to the start of the game, a coin is tossed and the winning captain can choose a starting end or whether to start with the ball. Since 2017 the game consists of four periods of 15 minutes with a 2-minute break after every period, and a 15-minute intermission at half time before changing ends. At the start of each period, as well as after goals are scored, play is started with a pass from the centre of the field. All players must start in their defensive half (apart from the player making the pass), but the ball may be played in any direction along the floor. Each team starts with the ball in one half, and the team that conceded the goal has possession for the restart. Teams trade sides at halftime. Field players may only play the ball with the face of the stick. If the back side of the stick is used, it is a penalty and the other team will get the ball back. Tackling is permitted as long as the tackler does not make contact with the attacker or the other person's stick before playing the ball (contact after the tackle may also be penalised if the tackle was made from a position where contact was inevitable). Further, the player with the ball may not deliberately use his body to push a defender out of the way. Field players may not play the ball with their feet, but if the ball accidentally hits the feet, and the player gains no benefit from the contact, then the contact is not penalised. Although there has been a change in the wording of this rule from 1 January 2007, the current FIH umpires' briefing instructs umpires not to change the way they interpret this rule.[32] Obstruction typically occurs in three circumstances – when a defender comes between the player with possession and the ball in order to prevent them tackling; when a defender's stick comes between the attacker's stick and the ball or makes contact with the attacker's stick or body; and also when blocking the opposition's attempt to tackle a teammate with the ball (called third party obstruction). When the ball passes completely over the sidelines (on the sideline is still in), it is returned to play with a sideline hit, taken by a member of the team whose players were not the last to touch the ball before crossing the sideline. The ball must be placed on the sideline, with the hit taken from as near the place the ball went out of play as possible. If it crosses the back line after last touched by an attacker, a 15 m (16 yd) hit is awarded. A 15 m hit is also awarded for offences committed by the attacking side within 15 m of the end of the pitch they are attacking. Set plays are often utilised for specific situations such as a penalty corner or free hit. For instance, many teams have penalty corner variations that they can use to beat the defensive team. The coach may have plays that sends the ball between two defenders and lets the player attack the opposing team's goal. There are no set plays unless your team has them. Free hits are awarded when offences are committed outside the scoring circles (the term 'free hit' is standard usage but the ball need not be hit). The ball may be hit, pushed or lifted in any direction by the team offended against. The ball can be lifted from a free hit but not by hitting, you must flick or scoop to lift from a free hit. (In previous versions of the rules, hits in the area outside the circle in open play have been permitted but lifting one direction from a free hit was prohibited). Opponents must move 5 m (5.5 yd) from the ball when a free hit is awarded. A free hit must be taken from within playing distance of the place of the offence for which it was awarded and the ball must be stationary when the free hit is taken. As mentioned above, a 15 m hit is awarded if an attacking player commits a foul forward of that line, or if the ball passes over the back line off an attacker. These free hits are taken in-line with where the foul was committed (taking a line parallel with the sideline between where the offence was committed, or the ball went out of play). When an attacking free hit is awarded within 5 m of the circle everyone including the person taking the penalty must be five meters from the circle and everyone apart from the person taking the free hit must be five meters away from the ball. When taking an attacking free hit, the ball may not be hit straight into the circle if you are within your attacking 23 meter area (25-yard area). It has to travel 5 meters before going in. In February 2009 the FIH introduced, as a \"Mandatory Experiment\" for international competition, an updated version of the free-hit rule. The changes allows a player taking a free hit to pass the ball to themselves. Importantly, this is not a \"play on\" situation, but to the untrained eye it may appear to be. The player must play the ball any distance in two separate motions, before continuing as if it were a play-on situation. They may raise an aerial or overhead immediately as the second action, or any other stroke permitted by the rules of field hockey. At high-school level, this is called a self pass and was adopted in Pennsylvania in 2010 as a legal technique for putting the ball in play. Also, all players (from both teams) must be at least 5 m from any free hit awarded to the attack within the 23 m area. The ball may not travel directly into the circle from a free hit to the attack within the 23 m area without first being touched by another player or being dribbled at least 5 m by a player making a \"self-pass\". These experimental rules apply to all free-hit situations, including sideline and corner hits. National associations may also choose to introduce these rules for their domestic competitions. A free hit from the 23-metre line – called a long corner – is awarded to the attacking team if the ball goes over the back-line after last being touched by a defender, provided they do not play it over the back-line deliberately, in which case a penalty corner is awarded. This free hit is played by the attacking team from a spot on the 23-metre line, in line with where the ball went out of play. All the parameters of an attacking free hit within the attacking quarter of the playing surface apply. The short or penalty corner is awarded: Short corners begin with five defenders (usually including the keeper) positioned behind the back line and the ball placed at least 10 yards from the nearest goal post.[33] All other players in the defending team must be beyond the centre line, that is not in their 'own' half of the pitch, until the ball is in play. Attacking players begin the play standing outside the scoring circle, except for one attacker who starts the corner by playing the ball from a mark 10 m either side of the goal (the circle has a 14.63 m radius). This player puts the ball into play by pushing or hitting the ball to the other attackers outside the circle; the ball must pass outside the circle and then put back into the circle before the attackers may make a shot at the goal from which a goal can be scored. FIH rules do not forbid a shot at goal before the ball leaves the circle after being 'inserted', nor is a shot at the goal from outside the circle prohibited, but a goal cannot be scored at all if the ball has not gone out of the circle and cannot be scored from a shot from outside the circle if it is not again played by an attacking player before it enters the goal. For safety reasons, the first shot of a penalty corner must not exceed 460 mm high (the height of the \"backboard\" of the goal) at the point it crosses the goal line if it is hit. However, if the ball is deemed to be below backboard height, the ball can be subsequently deflected above this height by another player (defender or attacker), providing that this deflection does not lead to danger. The \"Slap\" stroke (a sweeping motion towards the ball, where the stick is kept on or close to the ground when striking the ball) is classed as a hit, and so the first shot at goal must be below backboard height for this type of shot also. If the first shot at goal in a short corner situation is a push, flick or scoop, in particular the drag flick (which has become popular at international and national league standards), the shot is permitted to rise above the height of the backboard, as long as the shot is not deemed dangerous to any opponent. This form of shooting was developed because it is not height restricted in the same way as the first hit shot at the goal and players with good technique are able to drag-flick with as much power as many others can hit a ball. A penalty stroke is awarded when a defender commits a foul in the circle (accidental or otherwise) that prevents a probable goal or commits a deliberate foul in the circle or if defenders repeatedly run from the back line too early at a penalty corner. The penalty stroke is taken by a single attacker in the circle, against the goalkeeper, from a spot 6.4 m from goal. The ball is played only once at goal by the attacker using a push, flick or scoop stroke. If the shot is saved, play is restarted with a 15 m hit to the defenders. When a goal is scored, play is restarted in the normal way. According to the Rules of Hockey 2015[34] issued by the FIH there are only two criteria for a dangerously played ball. The first is legitimate evasive action by an opponent (what constitutes legitimate evasive action is an umpiring judgment). The second is specific to the rule concerning a shot at goal at a penalty corner but is generally, if somewhat inconsistently, applied throughout the game and in all parts of the pitch: it is that a ball lifted above knee height and at an opponent who is within 5m of the ball is certainly dangerous. The velocity of the ball is not mentioned in the rules concerning a dangerously played ball. A ball that hits a player above the knee may on some occasions not be penalised, this is at the umpire's discretion. A jab tackle, for example, might accidentally lift the ball above knee height into an opponent from close range but at such low velocity as not to be, in the opinion of the umpire, dangerous play. In the same way a high-velocity hit at very close range into an opponent, but below knee height, could be considered to be dangerous or reckless play in the view of the umpire, especially when safer alternatives are open to the striker of the ball. A ball that has been lifted high so that it will fall among close opponents may be deemed to be potentially dangerous and play may be stopped for that reason. A lifted ball that is falling to a player in clear space may be made potentially dangerous by the actions of an opponent closing to within 5m of the receiver before the ball has been controlled to ground – a rule which is often only loosely applied; the distance allowed is often only what might be described as playing distance, 2–3 m, and opponents tend to be permitted to close on the ball as soon as the receiver plays it: these unofficial variations are often based on the umpire's perception of the skill of the players i.e. on the level of the game, in order to maintain game flow, which umpires are in general in both Rules and Briefing instructed to do, by not penalising when it is unnecessary to do so; this is also a matter at the umpire's discretion. The term \"falling ball\" is important in what may be termed encroaching offences. It is generally only considered an offence to encroach on an opponent receiving a lifted ball that has been lifted to above head height (although the height is not specified in rule) and is falling. So, for example, a lifted shot at the goal which is still rising as it crosses the goal line (or would have been rising as it crossed the goal line) can be legitimately followed up by any of the attacking team looking for a rebound. In general even potentially dangerous play is not penalised if an opponent is not disadvantaged by it or, obviously, not injured by it so that he cannot continue. A personal penalty, that is a caution or a suspension, rather than a team penalty, such as a free ball or a penalty corner, may be (many would say should be or even must be, but again this is at the umpire's discretion) issued to the guilty party after an advantage allowed by the umpire has been played out in any situation where an offence has occurred, including dangerous play (but once advantage has been allowed the umpire cannot then call play back and award a team penalty). It is not an offence to lift the ball over an opponent's stick (or body on the ground), provided that it is done with consideration for the safety of the opponent and not dangerously. For example, a skilful attacker may lift the ball over a defenders stick or prone body and run past them, however if the attacker lifts the ball into or at the defender's body, this would almost certainly be regarded as dangerous. It is not against the rules to bounce the ball on the stick and even to run with it while doing so, as long as that does not lead to a potentially dangerous conflict with an opponent who is attempting to make a tackle. For example, two players trying to play at the ball in the air at the same time, would probably be considered a dangerous situation and it is likely that the player who first put the ball up or who was so 'carrying' it would be penalised. Dangerous play rules also apply to the usage of the stick when approaching the ball, making a stroke at it (replacing what was at one time referred to as the \"sticks\" rule, which once forbade the raising of any part of the stick above the shoulder during any play. This last restriction has been removed but the stick should still not be used in a way that endangers an opponent) or attempting to tackle, (fouls relating to tripping, impeding and obstruction). The use of the stick to strike an opponent will usually be much more severely dealt with by the umpires than offences such as barging, impeding and obstruction with the body, although these are also dealt with firmly, especially when these fouls are intentional. Green card (warning with 2 min suspension) Yellow card (suspension of 5 / 10 mins depending on intensity of foul) Red card (permanent suspension) Hockey uses a three-tier penalty card system of warnings and suspensions: If a coach is sent off, depending on local rules, a player may have to leave the field for the remaining length of the match. In addition to their colours, field hockey penalty cards are often shaped differently, so they can be recognised easily. Green cards are normally triangular, yellow cards rectangular and red cards circular. Unlike football, a player may receive more than one green or yellow card. However, they cannot receive the same card for the same offence (for example two yellows for dangerous play), and the second must always be a more serious card. In the case of a second yellow card for a different breach of the rules (for example a yellow for deliberate foot, and a second later in the game for dangerous play) the temporary suspension would be expected to be of considerably longer duration than the first. However, local playing conditions may mandate that cards are awarded only progressively, and not allow any second awards. Umpires, if the free hit would have been in the attacking 23 m area, may upgrade the free hit to a penalty corner for dissent or other misconduct after the free hit has been awarded. The teams' object is to play the ball into their attacking circle and, from there, hit, push or flick the ball into the goal, scoring a goal. The team with more goals after 60 minutes wins the game. The playing time may be shortened, particularly when younger players are involved, or for some tournament play. If the game is played in a countdown clock, like ice hockey, a goal can only count if the ball completely crosses the goal line and into the goal before time expires, not when the ball leaves the stick in the act of shooting. If the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time, or there is a penalty shoot-out, depending on the format of the competition. In many competitions (such as regular club competition, or in pool games in FIH international tournaments such as the Olympics or the World Cup), a tied result stands and the overall competition standings are adjusted accordingly. Since March 2013, when tie breaking is required, the official FIH Tournament Regulations mandate to no longer have extra time and go directly into a penalty shoot-out when a classification match ends in a tie.[35] However, many associations follow the previous procedure consisting of two periods of 7.5 minutes of \"golden goal\" extra time during which the game ends as soon as one team scores. There are many variations to overtime play that depend on the league or tournament rules. In American college play, a seven-a-side overtime period consists of a 10-minute golden goal period with seven players for each team. If the scores remain equal, the game enters a one-on-one competition where each team chooses five players to dribble from the 25-yard (23 m) line down to the circle against the opposing goalkeeper. The player has eight seconds to score against the goalkeeper while keeping the ball in bounds. The game ends after a goal is scored, the ball goes out of bounds, a foul is committed (ending in either a penalty stroke or flick or the end of the one-on-one) or time expires. If the tie still persists, more rounds are played until one team has scored. The FIH implemented a two-year rules cycle with the 2007–08 edition of the rules, with the intention that the rules be reviewed on a biennial basis. The 2009 rulebook was officially released in early March 2009 (effective 1 May 2009), however the FIH published the major changes in February. The current rule book is effective from 1 January 2022.[36] There are sometimes minor variations in rules from competition to competition; for instance, the duration of matches is often varied for junior competitions or for carnivals. Different national associations also have slightly differing rules on player equipment. The new Euro Hockey League and the Olympics has made major alterations to the rules to aid television viewers, such as splitting the game into four-quarters, and to try to improve player behavior, such as a two-minute suspension for green cards—the latter was also used in the 2010 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. In the United States, the NCAA has its own rules for inter-collegiate competitions; high school associations similarly play to different rules, usually using the rules published by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). This article assumes FIH rules unless otherwise stated. USA Field Hockey produces an annual summary of the differences.[37] In the United States, the games at the junior high level consist of four 12-minute periods, while the high-school level consists of four 15-minute periods. Many private American schools play 12-minute quarters, and some have adopted FIH rules rather than NFHS rules. Players are required to wear mouth guards and shin guards in order to play the game. Also, there is a newer rule requiring certain types of sticks be used. In recent years, the NFHS rules have moved closer to FIH, but in 2011 a new rule requiring protective eyewear was introduced for the 2011 Fall season. Further clarification of NFHS's rule requiring protective eyewear states, \"effective 1 January 2019, all eye protection shall be permanently labeled with the current ASTM 2713 standard for field hockey\".[38] Metal 'cage style' goggles favored by US high school lacrosse and permitted in high school field hockey is prohibited under FIH rules.[39] Each player carries a hockey stick that normally measures between 80 and 95 cm (31 and 37 in); shorter or longer sticks are available. The length of the stick is based on the player's individual height: the top of the stick usually comes to the player's hip, and taller players typically have longer sticks.[40] Goalkeepers can use either a specialised stick, or an ordinary field hockey stick. The specific goal-keeping sticks have another curve at the end of the stick, to give it more surface area to block the ball. Sticks were traditionally made of wood, but are now often made also with fibreglass, kevlar or carbon fibre composites. Metal is forbidden from use in field hockey sticks, due to the risk of injury from sharp edges if the stick were to break. The stick has a rounded handle, has a J-shaped hook at the bottom, and is flattened on the left side (when looking down the handle with the hook facing upwards). All sticks must be right-handed; left-handed ones are prohibited. There was traditionally a slight curve (called the bow, or rake) from the top to bottom of the face side of the stick and another on the 'heel' edge to the top of the handle (usually made according to the angle at which the handle part was inserted into the splice of the head part of the stick), which assisted in the positioning of the stick head in relation to the ball and made striking the ball easier and more accurate. The hook at the bottom of the stick was only recently[when?] the tight curve (Indian style) that we have nowadays. The older 'English' sticks had a longer bend, making it very hard to use the stick on the reverse. For this reason players now use the tight curved sticks. The handle makes up about the top third of the stick. It is wrapped in a grip similar to that used on tennis racket. The grip may be made of a variety of materials, including chamois leather, which improves grip in the wet and gives the stick a softer touch and different weighting it wrapped over a preexisting grip. It was recently discovered that increasing the depth of the face bow made it easier to get high speeds from the dragflick and made the stroke easier to execute. At first, after this feature was introduced, the Hockey Rules Board placed a limit of 50 mm on the maximum depth of bow over the length of the stick but experience quickly demonstrated this to be excessive. New rules now limit this curve to under 25 mm so as to limit the power with which the ball can be flicked. Standard field hockey balls are hard spherical balls, made of solid plastic (sometimes over a cork core), and are usually white, although they can be any colour as long as they contrast with the playing surface. The balls have a diameter of 71.3–74.8 mm (2.81–2.94 in) and a mass of 156–163 g (5.5–5.7 oz). The ball is often covered with indentations to reduce aquaplaning that can cause an inconsistent ball speed on wet surfaces.[citation needed] The 2007 rulebook saw major changes regarding goalkeepers. A fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, leg guards and kickers, and like all players, they must carry a stick. Goalkeepers may use either a field player's stick or a specialised goalkeeping stick provided always the stick is of legal dimensions. Usually field hockey goalkeepers also wear extensive additional protective equipment including chest guards, padded shorts, heavily padded hand protectors, groin protectors, neck protectors and arm guards. A goalie may not cross the 23 m line, the sole exception to this being if the goalkeeper is to take a penalty stroke at the other end of the field, when the clock is stopped. The goalkeeper can also remove their helmet for this action. While goalkeepers are allowed to use their feet and hands to clear the ball, like field players they may only use the one side of their stick. Slide tackling is permitted as long as it is with the intention of clearing the ball, not aimed at a player. It is now also even possible for teams to have a full eleven outfield players and no goalkeeper at all. No player may wear a helmet or other goalkeeping equipment, neither will any player be able to play the ball with any other part of the body than with their stick. This may be used to offer a tactical advantage, for example, if a team is trailing with only a short time to play, or to allow for play to commence if no goalkeeper or kit is available. The basic tactic in field hockey, as in association football and many other team games, is to outnumber the opponent in a particular area of the field at a moment in time. When in possession of the ball this temporary numerical superiority can be used to pass the ball around opponents so that they cannot effect a tackle because they cannot get within playing reach of the ball and to further use this numerical advantage to gain time and create clear space for making scoring shots on the opponent's goal. When not in possession of the ball numerical superiority is used to isolate and channel an opponent in possession and 'mark out' any passing options so that an interception or a tackle may be made to gain possession. Highly skillful players can sometimes get the better of more than one opponent and retain the ball and successfully pass or shoot but this tends to use more energy than quick early passing. Every player has a role depending on their relationship to the ball if the team communicates throughout the play of the game. There will be players on the ball (offensively – ball carriers; defensively – pressure, support players, and movement players. The main methods by which the ball is moved around the field by players are a) passing b) pushing the ball and running with it controlled to the front or right of the body and c) \"dribbling\"; where the player controls the ball with the stick and moves in various directions with it to elude opponents. To make a pass the ball may be propelled with a pushing stroke, where the player uses their wrists to push the stick head through the ball while the stick head is in contact with it; the \"flick\" or \"scoop\", similar to the push but with an additional arm and leg and rotational actions to lift the ball off the ground; and the \"hit\", where a swing at ball is taken and contact with it is often made very forcefully, causing the ball to be propelled at velocities in excess of 70 mph (110 km/h). In order to produce a powerful hit, usually for travel over long distances or shooting at the goal, the stick is raised higher and swung with maximum power at the ball, a stroke sometimes known as a \"drive\". Tackles are made by placing the stick into the path of the ball or playing the stick head or shaft directly at the ball. To increase the effectiveness of the tackle, players will often place the entire stick close to the ground horizontally, thus representing a wider barrier. To avoid the tackle, the ball carrier will either pass the ball to a teammate using any of the push, flick, or hit strokes, or attempt to maneuver or \"drag\" the ball around the tackle, trying to deceive the tackler. In recent years, the penalty corner has gained importance as a goal scoring opportunity. Particularly with the technical development of the drag flick. Tactics at penalty corners to set up time for a shot with a drag flick or a hit shot at the goal involve various complex plays, including multiple passes before deflections towards the goal is made but the most common method of shooting is the direct flick or hit at the goal. At the highest level, field hockey is a fast moving, highly skilled game, with players using fast moves with the stick, quick accurate passing, and hard hits, in attempts to keep possession and move the ball towards the goal. Tackling with physical contact and otherwise physically obstructing players is not permitted. Some of the tactics used resemble football (soccer), but with greater ball speed. With the 2009 changes to the rules regarding free hits in the attacking 23 m area, the common tactic of hitting the ball hard into the circle was forbidden. Although at higher levels this was considered tactically risky and low-percentage at creating scoring opportunities, it was used with some effect to 'win' penalty corners by forcing the ball onto a defender's foot or to deflect high (and dangerously) off a defender's stick. The FIH felt it was a dangerous practice that could easily lead to raised deflections and injuries in the circle, which is often crowded at a free-hit situation, and outlawed it. The biggest two field hockey tournaments are the Olympic Games tournament, and the Hockey World Cup, which is also held every four years. Apart from this, there is the men's and women's Pro League held each year for the nine top-ranked teams. Of the men's teams, Pakistan has won the Hockey World cup four times, more times than any other side. India has won the Hockey at the Summer Olympics eight times, including in six successive Olympiads. Of the female teams, the Netherlands has won the Hockey World cup the most times, with six titles. At the Olympics, Australia and the Netherlands have both won three Olympic tournaments. India and Pakistan dominated men's hockey until the early 1980s, winning eight Olympic golds and three of the first five world cups, respectively, but have become less prominent with the ascendancy of Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, and Spain since the late 1980s, as grass playing surfaces were replaced with artificial turf. Other notable men's nations include Argentina, England (who combine with other British \"Home Nations\" to form the Great Britain side at Olympic events) and South Korea. The Netherlands, Australia and Argentina are the most successful national teams among women. The Netherlands was the predominant women's team before field hockey was added to Olympic events. In the early 1990s, Australia emerged as the strongest women's country, though retirement of a number of players has weakened the team somewhat. Argentina improved its play in the 2000s, heading IFH rankings in 2003, 2010 and 2013. Other prominent women's teams are Germany, Great Britain, China, South Korea and India. Four nations have won Olympic gold medals in both men's and women's hockey: Germany, Netherlands, Australia and Great Britain. As of January 2022[update] the Australian men's team and the Dutch women's teams lead the FIH world rankings. For a couple of years, Belgium has emerged as a leading nation, with a World Champions title (2018), a European Champions title (2019), a silver medal (2016) followed with a title (2021) at the Olympics, and a lead in the FIH men's team world ranking. This is a list of the major international field hockey tournaments, in chronological order. Tournaments included are: Defunct tournaments: Other international tournaments include: A popular variant of field hockey is indoor field hockey, which is 6-a-side (5-a-side during 2014–2015) using a field which is reduced to approximately 40 m × 20 m (131 ft × 66 ft). Although many of the rules remain the same, including obstruction and feet, there are several key variations: players may not raise the ball unless shooting at goal, players may not hit the ball, instead using pushes to transfer it, and the sidelines are replaced with solid barriers, from which the ball will rebound and remain in play.[30] In addition, the regulation guidelines for the indoor field hockey stick require a slightly thinner, lighter stick than an outdoor one.[41] As the name suggests, Hockey5s is a hockey variant which features five players on each team (including a goalkeeper). The field of play is 55 m long and 41.70 m wide—this is approximately half the size of a regular pitch. Few additional markings are needed as there is no penalty circle nor penalty corners; shots can be taken from anywhere on the pitch. Penalty strokes are replaced by a \"challenge\" which is like the one-on-one method used in a penalty shoot-out. The duration of the match is three 12-minute periods with an interval of two minutes between periods; golden goal periods are multiple 5-minute periods. The rules are simpler and it is intended that the game is faster, creating more shots on goal with less play in midfield, and more attractive to spectators.[42] An Asian qualification tournament for two places at the 2014 Youth Olympic Games was the first time an FIH event used the Hockey5s format. Hockey5s was also used for the Youth Olympic hockey tournament, the Pacific Games in 2015 and at the African Youth Games is 2018.[citation needed] In 2022, the FIH staged its first senior international Hockey5s event, with a men's and women's event being held in Lausanne.[43] The FIH Men's Hockey5s World Cup and FIH Women's Hockey5s World Cup are set to debut in 2024.

What we eat, where we go to school, what kind of education we receive, how our tax money is spent, and what we do in our free time are all affected by government. Americans are often unaware of the pervasiveness of government in their everyday lives, and many are unsure precisely what it does. Here we will look at what government is, what it does, and how the government of the United States differs from other kinds of governments. The term government describes the means by which a society organizes itself and how it allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs. Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity, secure national borders, and the safety and well-being of citizens. Governments also provide benefits for their citizens. The type of benefits provided differ according to the country and their specific type of governmental system, but governments commonly provide such things as education, health care, and an infrastructure for transportation. The term politics refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals, especially those related to the division of resources within a nation. Sometimes governmental systems are confused with economic systems. This is because certain types of political thought or governmental organization are closely related to or develop with certain types of economic systems. For example, the economic system of capitalism in Western Europe and North America developed at roughly the same time as ideas about democratic republics, self-government, and natural rights. At this time, the idea of liberty became an important concept. According to John Locke, an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century, all people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed. In the eighteenth century, in Great Britain’s North American colonies, and later in France, this developed into the idea that people should govern themselves through elected representatives and not a king; only those representatives chosen by the people had the right to make laws to govern them. Similarly, Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher who was born nineteen years after Locke’s death, believed that all people should be free to acquire property in any way that they wished. Instead of being controlled by government, business, and industry, Smith argued, people should be allowed to operate as they wish and keep the proceeds of their work. Competition would ensure that prices remained low and faulty goods disappeared from the market. In this way, businesses would reap profits, consumers would have their needs satisfied, and society as a whole would prosper. Smith discussed these ideas, which formed the basis for industrial capitalism, in his book The Wealth of Nations, which was published in 1776, the same year that the Declaration of Independence was written. Representative government and capitalism developed together in the United States, and many Americans tend to equate democracy, a political system in which people govern themselves, with capitalism. In theory, a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled, for good or bad, by government. Capitalism, in turn, relies on individualism. At the same time, successful capitalists prefer political systems over which they can exert at least some influence in order to maintain their liberty. Democracy and capitalism do not have to go hand in hand, however. Indeed, one might argue that a capitalist economic system might be bad for democracy in some respects. Although Smith theorized that capitalism would lead to prosperity for all, this has not necessarily been the case. Great gaps in wealth between the owners of major businesses, industries, and financial institutions and those who work for others in exchange for wages exist in many capitalist nations. In turn, great wealth may give a very small minority great influence over the government—a greater influence than that held by the majority of the population, which will be discussed later. Socialism is an alternative economic system. In socialist societies, the means of generating wealth, such as factories, large farms, and banks, are owned by the government and not by private individuals. The government accumulates wealth and then redistributes it to citizens, primarily in the form of social programs that provide such things as free or inexpensive health care, education, and childcare. In socialist countries, the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity, transportation systems like airlines and railroads, and telecommunications systems. In many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy: only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government. For example, in China, the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party. In the United States, the democratic government works closely together with its capitalist economic system. The interconnectedness of the two affects the way in which goods and services are distributed. The market provides many goods and services needed by Americans. For example, food, clothing, and housing are provided in ample supply by private businesses that earn a profit in return. These goods and services are known as private goods.1 People can purchase what they need in the quantity in which they need it. This, of course, is the ideal. In reality, those who live in poverty cannot always afford to buy ample food and clothing to meet their needs, or the food and clothing that they can afford to buy in abundance is of inferior quality. Also, it is often difficult to find adequate housing; housing in the most desirable neighborhoods—those that have low crime rates and good schools—is often too expensive for poor or working-class (and sometimes middle-class) people to buy or rent. Thus, the market cannot provide everything (in enough quantity or at low enough costs) in order to meet everyone’s needs. Therefore, some goods are provided by the government. Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called public goods. Two such public goods are national security and education. It is difficult to see how a private business could protect the United States from attack. How could it build its own armies and create plans for defense and attack? Who would pay the men and women who served? Where would the intelligence come from? Due to its ability to tax, draw upon the resources of an entire nation, and compel citizen compliance, only government is capable of protecting the nation. Similarly, public schools provide education for all children in the United States. Children of all religions, races and ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, and levels of academic ability can attend public schools free of charge from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. It would be impossible for private schools to provide an education for all of the nation’s children. Private schools do provide some education in the United States; however, they charge tuition, and only those parents who can afford to pay their fees (or whose children gain a scholarship) can attend these institutions. Some schools charge very high tuition, the equivalent to the tuition at a private college. If private schools were the only educational institutions, most poor and working-class children and many middle-class children would be uneducated. Private schooling is a type of good called a toll good. Toll goods are available to many people, and many people can make use of them, but only if they can pay the price. They occupy a middle ground between public and private goods. All parents may send their children to public schools in the United States. They can choose to send their children to a private school, but the private school will charge them. On the other hand, public schools, which are operated by the government, provide free education so all children can attend school. Therefore, everyone in the nation benefits from the educated voters and workers produced by the public school system. Another distinction between public and private goods is that public goods are available to all, typically without additional charge. What other public goods does government provide in the United States? At the federal, state, and local level, government provides stability and security, not only in the form of a military but also in the form of police and fire departments. Government provides other valuable goods and services such as public education, public transportation, mail service, and food, housing, and health care for the poor (Figure 1.2). If a house catches on fire, the fire department does not demand payment before they put the fire out. If someone breaks into a house and tries to harm the occupants, the police will try to protect them and arrest the intruder, but the police department will not request payment for services rendered. The provision of these goods and services is funded by citizens paying into the general tax base. Government also performs the important job of protecting common goods: goods that all people may use free of charge but that are of limited supply, such as fish in the sea or clean drinking water. Because everyone can use these goods, they must be protected so a few people do not take everything that is available and leave others with nothing. Some examples of common goods, private goods, public goods, and toll goods are listed below (Figure 1.3). This federal website shares information about the many services the government provides. One of the many important things government does is regulate public access to common goods like natural resources. Unlike public goods, which all people may use without charge, common goods are in limited supply. If more public schools are needed, the government can build more. If more firefighters or mail carriers are needed, the government can hire them. Public lands and wildlife, however, are not goods the government can simply multiply if supply falls due to demand. Indeed, if some people take too freely from the supply of common goods, there will not be enough left for others to use. Fish are one of the many common goods in which the government currently regulates access. It does so to ensure that certain species are not fished into extinction, thus depriving future generations of an important food source and a means to make a living. This idea is known as sustainability. Environmentalists want to set strict fishing limits on a variety of species. Commercial fishers resist these limits, claiming they are unnecessary and, if enforced, would drive them out of business (Figure 1.4). Currently, fishing limits are set by a combination of scientists, politicians, local resource managers, and groups representing the interests of fishers.3 Should the government regulate fishing? Is it right to interfere with people’s ability to earn money today in order to protect the access of future generations to the nation’s common goods? Besides providing stability and goods and services for all, government also creates a structure by which goods and services can be made available to the people. In the United States, people elect representatives to city councils, state legislatures, and Congress. These bodies make laws to govern their respective jurisdictions. They also pass measures to raise money, through the imposition of taxes on such things as income, property, and sales. Local, state, and national governments also draft budgets to determine how the revenue taken in will be spent for services. On the local level, funds are allotted for education, police and fire departments, and maintenance of public parks. State governments allocate money for state colleges and universities, maintenance of state roads and bridges, and wildlife management, among other priorities. On the national level, money goes to such things as defense, Social Security, pensions for veterans, maintenance of federal courts and prisons, and management of national parks. At each level, representatives elected by the people try to secure funding for things that will benefit those who live in the areas they represent. Once money has been allocated, government agencies at each level then receive funds for the purposes mentioned above and use them to provide services to the public. Local, state, and national governments also make laws to maintain order and to ensure the efficient functioning of society, including the fair operation of the business marketplace. In the United States, for example, Congress passes laws regulating banking, and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories, the purity of food offered for sale, and the safety of toys and automobiles. In this way, government checks the actions of business, something that it would not do if capitalism in the United States functioned strictly in the manner that Adam Smith believed it should…almost entirely unregulated. Besides providing goods to citizens and maintaining public safety, most governments also provide a means for citizens to participate in government and to make their opinions known to those in power. Western democracies like the United States, Britain, France, and others protect citizens’ freedom of speech and the press. These nations, and others in the world, also allow citizens to vote. As noted earlier, politics is the process by which choices are made regarding how resources will be allocated and which economic and social policies government will pursue. Put more simply, politics is the process of who gets what and how. Politics involves choosing which values government will support and which it will not. If government chooses to support an ideal such as individualism, it may choose to loosen regulations on business and industry or to cut taxes so that people have more money to invest in business. If it chooses to support an ideal such as egalitarianism, which calls for equal treatment for all and the destruction of socioeconomic inequalities, it may raise taxes in order to be able to spend more on public education, public transportation, housing for the poor, and care for the elderly. If, for example, the government is more concerned with national security than with individual liberty, it may authorize the tapping of people’s phones and restrict what newspapers may publish. If liberty is more important, then government will place greater restrictions on the extent that law enforcement agencies can intrude upon citizens’ private communications. The political process and the input of citizens help determine the answer. Civic engagement, or the participation that connects citizens to government, is a vital ingredient of politics. In the United States, citizens play an important role in influencing what policies are pursued, what values the government chooses to support, what initiatives are granted funding, and who gets to make the final decisions. Political engagement can take many forms: reading about politics, listening to news reports, discussing politics, attending (or watching televised) political debates, donating money to political campaigns, handing out flyers promoting a candidate, voting, joining protest marches, and writing letters to their elected representatives. The government of the United States can best be described as a republic, or representative democracy. A democracy is a government in which political power—influence over institutions, leaders, and policies—rests in the hands of the people. In a representative democracy, however, the citizens do not govern directly. Instead, they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf. Most representative governments favor majority rule: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority. If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it, the law will be enacted. However, in representative governments like the United States, minority rights are protected: people cannot be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be. For example, let’s say American society decided that atheists, people who do not believe that God exists, were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country. Even though atheists only account for about 7 percent of the population, they would be protected due to minority rights.4 Even though the number of Americans who believe in God far outweighs the number who do not, the minority is still protected. Because decisions are made through majority rule, making your opinions known and voting for those men and women who make decisions that affect all of us are critical and influential forms of civic engagement in a representative democracy such as the United States. In a direct democracy, unlike representative democracy, people participate directly in making government decisions. For example, in ancient Athens, the most famous example of a direct democracy, all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly. Here they debated and voted for or against all proposed laws. Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy—the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government—some elements of direct democracy do exist in the United States. While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress, people may still directly vote on certain issues. For example, a referendum or proposed law might be placed on the ballot for citizens to vote on directly during state or local elections instead of leaving the matter in the hands of the state legislature. At New England town meetings, all residents are allowed to debate decisions affecting the town (Figure 1.5). Such occasions provide additional opportunities for civic engagement. Most countries now have some form of representative government.5 At the other end of the political spectrum are elite-driven forms of government. In a monarchy, one ruler, usually a hereditary ruler, holds political power. Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law, and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country, this is not always the case. Many southwest Asian kingdoms, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted. As discussed earlier, another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy, in which a handful of elite members of society, often those who belong to a particular political party, hold all political power. For example, in Cuba, as in China, only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office, and the party’s most important members make all government decisions. Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature. Under totalitarianism, the government is more important than the citizens, and it controls all aspects of citizens’ lives. Citizens’ rights are limited, and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition. These forms of government are fairly rare. North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government.

The elected representatives are in turn accountable to the electorate for their actions. As a form of democracy, representative democracy exists in contrast to direct democracy, in which all citizens directly vote on laws to be passed and other issues. Most modern countries are representative democracies, and, as such, they face many challenges. Ancient Rome practiced the earliest known form of representative democracy in the Western world. The Romans called their state a republic (from the Latin respublica, meaning, literally, “a thing that belongs to the people”). During the era of the Roman Republic, which began in 509 bce, meetings were held in a public space, known as the forum, at the centre of each city within Roman territory. Citizenship was typically conferred by birth to all men if both parents were Roman citizens, though one of them, usually the mother, could be an alien with the right to contract a Roman marriage. Citizenship was also granted by naturalization and by manumission of enslaved people. As the republic evolved, Roman government came to have four assemblies along with the Senate, which had existed in various forms for centuries. The four assemblies, or comitia, were the Comitia Curiata, drawn from men claiming affiliation with one of several tribal groups (believed to be three groups originally created by Romulus); the Comitia Centuriata, made up of military units; the Concilium Plebis, consisting of plebeians; and the Comitia Tributa, open to any citizen. Votes within these assemblies were counted by groups, variously defined, rather than by the individuals who made up these groups. Senators were chosen indirectly by the Comitia Centuriata and exercised significant power—far more than the assemblies, which ostensibly represented all Roman citizens. By the 3rd century bce, all Roman citizens had been enfranchised, but the value of the voting right was related to wealth. Women lacked any voice in public life and had no voting rights, being at all times subject to the authority of a man, typically their father or husband. As Rome expanded across Italy, new subjects were allowed to govern their own affairs while enjoying most rights of Roman citizenship except the right to vote. Latin allies who moved to Rome permanently gained full citizenship. Allies bound to Rome by treaty did not enjoy full rights but were required to pay taxes or tribute as well as provide military service; these allies revolted against their inferior social status, leading to the Social War (90–89 bce), at the end of which full citizenship was given to all men of Italy, sans those who were enslaved, south of the Po River. The purpose of, and power wielded by, the comitia changed after the republic collapsed and was replaced by the Roman Empire in 27 bce. This Roman form of democracy became the basis for most modern representative democracies. The Italian city-states that rose up in the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire in western Europe, such as Venice and Florence, held elections for their leaders and called themselves republics, but they limited citizen participation to only a fraction of their male population. In medieval England, Simon de Montfort played a role in two parliaments that are considered important to the development of representative democracy. The first, in 1258, consisted of a group of barons who removed from King Henry III his unlimited powers through what was, in effect, England’s first written constitution. The second, in 1265, included citizens from English towns. During the 17th century, Parliament opposed the power of the British monarch during the civil wars of 1642−51, and its passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689 made possible the Glorious Revolution, which rendered Parliament, and not the monarch, Great Britain’s ruling power. The right to vote in Britain was expanded through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries, further reinforcing Parliament’s power and underscoring the place of representative democracy in Britain. The United States and France are republics that have played an important role in the adoption and spread of representative democracy. Following the American Revolution, the United States adopted a new constitution in 1787 that adopted principles of representative democracy, with members of the House of Representatives directly elected by citizens with the right to vote. (Members of the Senate were elected indirectly until 1913.) Voting rights expanded over time to include women, men who did not own property, and Black people, among other groups. France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789, and the deputies that made up the short-lived National Convention were elected through universal male suffrage in 1792. Those voting rights subsequently eroded, however, until the revolution of 1848 resulted in their reinstatement; nearly a century later, suffrage was granted to women. Modern representative democracies have come into being through a variety of political institutions, most of which made their first appearance in Europe and the United States in the 18th century. The concept of representation is itself the most important, because it enables government officials who are elected by citizens to make major decisions and establish policies. Important institutions include: More than half of the world’s countries are some form of representative democracy. Some are parliamentary constitutional monarchies, in which the head of state is a hereditary monarch and most or all political decisions and initiatives are the responsibility of an elected parliament. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands fall in this category. Countries such as Germany and India are federal parliamentary republics, which typically have a bicameral parliament. In a bicameral parliament, one of the houses (typically called the lower house) is directly elected by the country’s citizens. The other house (the upper house) is elected by representatives of individual states or regions of the country. Since the regional representatives are in turn elected by citizens of those regions, the upper house is indirectly elected by the people. Federal parliamentary republics allow for each state or region to have a say in decisions made at the national, or federal, level. The United Kingdom also has a bicameral legislature, but the upper house, the House of Lords, is not an elected body, its members taking their positions by appointment or on account of a hereditary seat. France follows a semi-presidential republic model in which the president is a popularly (and directly) elected head of state, but the president’s cabinet is responsible to an elected legislature, the National Assembly, which in turn supports the appointment of a prime minister. In contrast, the United States is a presidential republic system, in which the president is popularly elected and can appoint a cabinet but exists separately from elected federal legislative bodies (the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives). A representative democracy allows voters the opportunity to elect their preferred representative, who is then expected to follow the will of the electorate in making decisions. Thus citizens remove themselves from the strain of day-to-day decision making, while retaining the right to voice their opinions and to campaign or lobby for their points of view. Representatives can shape laws and policies in a way that gives the greatest benefit to the most people. However, once elected, representatives are not legally obligated to reflect the will of the people. The lure of political influence, monetary gain, and other factors can result in accusations of corruption or undue influence and damage the integrity of an elected institution. Elected representatives may choose to not honour their promises, safe in the knowledge that their position is secure until the next election. A disconnect from political processes can also lead to apathy among citizens, reducing their incentive to vote or otherwise participate in elections and other decision-making processes. Lastly, the election of representatives can deeply polarize citizens, especially in instances in which the election result was a narrow call, or disputed, leading to doubts over a representative’s victory. In such cases, a significant portion of the population may feel unrepresented or neglected by the elected representative, resulting in citizens’ apathy or in attempts by them to have their voices heard, such as protests or strikes.", "Representative democracy, also known as indirect democracy, is a type of democracy where elected delegates represent a group of people, in contrast to direct democracy.[1] Nearly all modern Western-style democracies function as some type of representative democracy: for example, the United Kingdom (a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy), Germany (a federal parliamentary republic), France (a unitary semi-presidential republic), and the United States (a federal presidential republic).[2] Representative democracy places power in the hands of representatives who are elected by the people.[3] Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives).[4] Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy.[5][6] Representative democracy can be organized in different ways, including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber or two chambers. Where two chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways. The power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power:[7] Theorists such as Edmund Burke believe that part of the duty of a representative was not simply to communicate the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters:[8] Certainly, Gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a Representative, to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the Law and the Constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. The Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries,[9] and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader.[10] Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly.[11] A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems. In Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments.[12][13] The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns.[14] Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689.[15][16] Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries. The American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and Black people, and others not originally given voting rights, in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Until it was repealed by the Fourteenth Amendment following the Civil War, the Three-Fifths Compromise gave a disproportionate representation of slave states in the House of Representatives relative to the voters in free states.[17][18] In 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all males in 1792.[19] Universal male suffrage was re-established in France in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848.[20] Representative democracy came into general favour particularly in post-industrial revolution nation states where large numbers of citizens evinced interest in politics, but where technology and population figures remained unsuited to direct democracy.[citation needed] Many historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern representative democracy in the United Kingdom.[21][22] Globally, a majority of governments in the world are representative democracies, including constitutional monarchies and republics with strong representative branches.[23] Separate but related, and very large, bodies of research in political philosophy and social science investigate how and how well elected representatives, such as legislators, represent the interests or preferences of one or another constituency. The empirical research shows that representative systems tend to be biased towards the representation of more affluent classes, to the detriment of the population at large.[24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31] In his book Political Parties, written in 1911, Robert Michels argues that most representative systems deteriorate towards an oligarchy or particracy. This is known as the iron law of oligarchy.[32] Representative democracies which are stable have been analysed by Adolf Gasser and compared to the unstable representative democracies in his book Gemeindefreiheit als Rettung Europas which was published in 1943 and a second edition in 1947.[33] Adolf Gasser stated the following requirements for a representative democracy in order to remain stable, unaffected by the iron law of oligarchy: A drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance.[34] Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized.[35] Proponents of direct democracy criticize representative democracy due to its inherent structure. As the fundamental basis of representative democracy is non inclusive system, in which representatives turn into an elite class that works behind closed doors, as well as the criticizing the elector system as being driven by a capitalistic and authoritarian system.[36][37] The system of stochocracy has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected. Stochocracy aims to at least reduce this degradation by having all representatives appointed by lottery instead of by voting. Therefore, this system is also called lottocracy. The system was proposed by the writer Roger de Sizif in 1998 in his book La Stochocratie. Choosing officeholders by lot was also the standard practice in ancient Athenian democracy[38] and in ancient India. The rationale behind this practice was to avoid lobbying and electioneering by economic oligarchs. The system of deliberative democracy is a mix between a majority-ruled system and a consensus-based system. It allows for representative democracies or direct democracies to coexist with its system of governance, providing an initial advantage.[39]"]}

Released in 1975, the upbeat track became a big hit for the band. Although the exact inspiration behind the song has not been explicitly confirmed by John Deacon himself, it is widely believed to have been written in honor of his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff, whom he married in 1975. The lyrics express love, appreciation, and loyalty towards a close companion, so it could be interpreted as a tribute to the deep bond between Deacon and his spouse.", "token_usage": 122, "human_written_evidences": [], "reference_documents": [], "model_retrieved_documents": ["Song Meanings and Facts by SMF · Published March 14, 2019 · Updated March 16, 2019 “You’re My Best Friend” is a song penned by former Queen bass guitarist John Deacon. It was written in 1975, the same year that Deacon married his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff, and accordingly, it is dedicated to her. It is also interesting to note that as of now, over 4 decades years later, John and Veronica are still married. And as evident from this song, his love for her was very much present from the start. For instance, he defines her as being the personification of all the world has to offer to him. In fact she is the one who actually gives him life. And even when he wanders astray, he has to come back to her, not only for the joy he experiences in her company but also because she is the one who has stood with him through thick and thin. In fact when life seems unfavorable to John, Veronica is the first one to show her support. Another notable characteristic that the subject of this song possesses is her ability to make the world in general seem like a better place to the singer. And all of this ultimately boils down to him coming to the conclusion that she is his “best friend” and in fact has become an invaluable part of his earthly existence. This is the fourth song on the first side of Queen’s 1975 album “A Night at the Opera”, which was their fourth studio album overall. Additional Queen albums this song is featured on are: Live Killers (1979) and Greatest Hits (1981). Furthermore, the song was also featured Queen’s 2009 compilation album titled Absolute Greatest (2009). In 2014, it once again was featured in another compilation album by the band titled Queen Forever. Beautiful song. I love that Queen got all light and poppy for this one.

Published on By Picking a follow-up to “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which quickly became one of the best-selling singles of all time after its release, on October 31, 1975, would have been a challenge for any band. Queen, however, had the answer: a catchy love song written by their bass player, John Deacon, and which was given the name “You’re My Best Friend.” Deacon penned just the one song for A Night At The Opera, Queen’s fourth studio album. “You’re My Best Friend” was written about his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff, a former trainee teacher from Sheffield, and turned out to be an enduring hit. The song expressed his devotion in heartfelt lyrics: “You’re my sunshine and I want you to know/That my feelings are true/I really love you/Oh, you’re my best friend.” Singer Freddie Mercury said he always liked “the almost Tamla Motown style of Deacon’s songs.” The band’s bassist wrote the song at home. “Freddie didn’t like the electric piano, so I took it home and I started to learn on the electric piano and basically that’s the song that came out when I was learning to play piano,” said Deacon. “It was written on that instrument and it sounds best on that.” Watch this video on YouTube The song, featuring clever arrangements which displayed the brilliant harmonizing of the band, was recorded in August 1975 in London. Roger Taylor’s deft drumming, with bass, snare, and hi-hat, combined well with Deacon’s Fender bass. Deacon also played the Wurlitzer EP-200 electric piano on the track, while Brian May worked his usual magic with five different guitar tracks on his famous Red Special. “John didn’t write that many songs but when he did – as with ‘Another One Bites the Dust’ and ‘I Want To Break Free’ – they were big, big hits,” said May. “‘You’re My Best Friend’ became one of the most-played tracks on American radio. John was a dark horse, generally the quiet guy in Queen. We would ask him sometimes, ‘Have you got anything, John?’ and he was very self-effacing about what he had written. ‘You’re My Best Friend’ was about his lovely lady wife.” The success of the “Bohemian Rhapsody” video persuaded the band to use that promotional tool again. The clip for “You’re My Best Friend” – which shows the band in a huge ballroom, with a glittering chandelier, surrounded by more than a thousand candles – was directed by Bruce Gowers. It was shot at Elstree Studios in London during an unseasonably warm spring day. There was no air conditioning and the heat from the candles and lights made for an uncomfortable session. For the video, Deacon played a grand piano, the same instrument Mercury used when the song was performed in concert. “I refused to play that damn thing,” Mercury said of the electric piano. “It’s tiny and horrible and I don’t like them. Why play those when you have a lovely superb piano?” The three-minute single was released on June 10, 1976, in the United States, and frequent radio plays helped it become a hit. “You’re My Best Friend” began an eight-week run in the UK singles charts on July 3, reaching a peak position of No.7. It also reached No.16 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was later certified platinum in America, with more than one million copies sold. Coincidentally, country singer Don Williams had a hit with his own song titled “You’re My Best Friend” later that year. Queen’s song has featured in numerous films and television shows, including The Simpsons, Family Guy, and EastEnders. Deacon’s sweet ballad, which also played at the end of the zombie-movie parody Shaun Of The Dead, has also been covered by other artists, including The Supernaturals (1997) and Stevie Ann (2014). When Queen released their album Live Killers in 1979, comprising performances of songs from concerts around Europe, they included a neat two-minute version of “You’re My Best Friend.” Decades on from the chart success of “You’re My Best Friend,” Deacon lives quietly in London, and is still married to Veronica, the love of his life, with whom he raised six children. “If you haven’t learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven’t learned anything,” said boxer Muhammad Ali, another man capable of landing big hits in the 70s. Deacon’s song remains one of the most popular ever written about the subject. Listen to the best of Queen on Apple Music and Spotify.

The song brought Williams his second No. 1 hit, as it ranked atop Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart and marked Williams’ true beginning as a commercial juggernaut, as the song topped Canadian RPM Country Tracks. It even cracked the U.K. Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 35. It has since become one of his signature tunes and paved the way for several songs by Don Williams to enter the country charts. Written by songwriter Wayland Holyfield, “You’re My Best Friend” is a simple, genuine sentiment of love and friendship to a long-term romantic partner. “You’re my bread when I’m hungry. You’re my shelter from troubled winds. You’re my anchor in life’s ocean. But most of all, you’re my best friend,” the song goes. Holyfield was actually just new in the songwriting business when he penned this song about his wife, but he knew it would resonate with every person who is in that type of special relationship. Indeed, it was! The moment Don Williams began singing the romantic ballad in his shows, he noticed how the audiences had already picked up all the lyrics. It then quickly grew into a major sing-along segment of his live shows. The song also marked a long and fruitful partnership between Williams and Holyfield. “You’re My Best Friend” was actually Holyfield’s first No. 1 hit on the U.S. charts in a career that would see him writing songs for some of the most notable country artists – from Charley Pride to George Strait.

The band’s bassist wrote the song at home. “Freddie didn’t like the electric piano, so I took it home and I started to learn on the electric piano and basically that’s the song that came out when I was learning to play piano,” said Deacon. “It was written on that instrument and it sounds best on that.” The song, featuring clever arrangements which displayed the brilliant harmonising of the band, was recorded in August 1975 in London. Roger Taylor’s deft drumming, with bass, snare and hi-hat, combined well with Deacon’s Fender bass. Deacon also played the Wurlitzer EP-200 electric piano on the track, while Brian May worked his usual magic with five different guitar tracks on his famous Red Special. “John didn’t write that many songs but when he did – as with ‘Another One Bites the Dust’ and ‘I Want To Break Free’ – they were big, big hits,” said May. “‘You’re My Best Friend’ became one of the most-played tracks on American radio. John was a dark horse, generally the quiet guy in Queen. We would ask him sometimes, ‘Have you got anything, John?’ and he was very self-effacing about what he had written. ‘You’re My Best Friend’ was about his lovely lady wife.” The success of the ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ video persuaded the band to use that promotional tool again. The clip for ‘You’re My Best Friend’ – which shows the band in a huge ballroom, with a glittering chandelier, surrounded by more than a thousand candles – was directed by Bruce Gowers. It was shot at Elstree Studios in London during an unseasonably warm spring day. There was no air conditioning and the heat from the candles and lights made for an uncomfortable session. For the video, Deacon played a grand piano, the same instrument Mercury used when the song was performed in concert. “I refused to play that damn thing,” Mercury said of the electric piano. “It’s tiny and horrible and I don’t like them. Why play those when you have a lovely superb piano?” The three-minute single was released on 18 May 1976 and frequent radio plays helped it become a hit. ‘You’re My Best Friend’ began an eight-week run in the UK singles charts on 3 July, reaching a peak position of No.7. It also reached No.16 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was later certified platinum in America, with more than one million copies sold. Coincidentally, country singer Don Williams had a hit with his own song titled ‘You’re My Best Friend’ later that year. Queen’s song has featured in numerous films and television shows, including The Simpsons, Family Guy and EastEnders. Deacon’s sweet ballad, which also played at the end of the zombie-movie parody Shaun Of The Dead, has also been covered by other artists, including The Supernaturals (1997) and Stevie Ann (2014). When Queen released their album Live Killers in 1979, comprising performances of songs from concerts around Europe, they included a neat two-minute version of ‘You’re My Best Friend’. Four decades on from the chart success of ‘You’re My Best Friend’, Deacon lives quietly in London, away from the music business, and is still married to Veronica, the love of his life, with whom he raised six children. “If you haven’t learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven’t learned anything,” said boxer Muhammad Ali, another man capable of landing big hits in the 70s. Deacon’s song remains one of the most popular ever written about the subject. Listen to the best of Queen on Apple Music and Spotify. This content was originally published here.

{"question": "where was the church of latter day saints founded", "answer": ["April 6, 1830", "western New York"], "mgt": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) was founded by Joseph Smith on April 6, 1830, in Fayette, New York, United States. Joseph Smith published the Book of Mormon, which Latter-day Saints believe to be another testament of Jesus Christ, and he organized the church to restore what he believed to be the original Christian church as established by Jesus Christ. The LDS Church has since grown to become a global religion with millions of members worldwide.", "token_usage": 97, "human_written_evidences": [], "reference_documents": [], "model_retrieved_documents": ["The history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is typically divided into three broad periods:[1][2][3] The LDS Church originated in an area of Western New York known as the burned-over district, characterized by religious fervor and social radicalism. Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, was raised in this region during a period of U.S. history known as the Second Great Awakening. Smith gained a small following in the late 1820s as he was dictating the Book of Mormon, which he said was a translation of inscriptions found on a set of golden plates buried near his home in Upstate New York by an Indigenous American prophet named Moroni. On April 6, 1830, at the home of Peter Whitmer in Fayette, New York, Smith organized the religion's first legal church entity, the Church of Christ. The church rapidly gained a following who viewed Smith as their prophet. The main body of the church moved first to Kirtland, Ohio in the early 1830s, then to Missouri in 1838 where the 1838 Mormon War with other Missouri settlers ensued. This culminated in adherents being expelled from the state under Missouri Executive Order 44 signed by Lilburn W. Boggs, the Governor of Missouri. After fleeing from Missouri, Smith founded the city of Nauvoo, Illinois, which grew rapidly and had a population of about 12,000 people, nearly all members of Smith's church, at the time Smith was killed. After his death, a succession crisis ensued and the majority voted to accept the Quorum of the Twelve, led by Brigham Young, as the church's leading body.[4] After continued difficulties and persecution in Illinois, Young left Nauvoo in 1846 and led his followers, the Mormon pioneers, to the Great Salt Lake Valley. The Mormon pioneers then branched out in an effort to pioneer a large state called Deseret, establishing colonies that spanned from Canada to present-day Mexico. Young incorporated the LDS Church as a legal entity and governed his followers as a theocratic leader, assuming both political and religious positions. He also publicized the previously secret practice of plural marriage, a form of polygamy. By 1857, tensions had again escalated between Latter-day Saints and other Americans, largely as a result of the teachings on polygamy and theocracy. During the Utah War, from 1857 to 1858, the United States Army conducted a relatively peaceful invasion of Utah, after which Young agreed to be replaced by a non-Mormon territorial Governor, Alfred Cumming. The church, however, still wielded significant political power in Utah Territory. Even after Young's death in 1877, many members continued the practice of polygamy despite opposition by the United States Congress. When tensions with the U.S. government came to a head in 1890, the church officially abandoned the public practice of polygamy in the United States, and eventually stopped performing official polygamous marriages altogether after a Second Manifesto in 1904. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of excommunicating members who were found to be practicing polygamy, and today seeks to actively distance itself from polygamist fundamentalist groups. During the 20th century, the church became an international organization. The church first began engaging with mainstream American culture, and then with international cultures, particularly those of Latin America, by sending out thousands of missionaries. The church began publicly supporting monogamy and the nuclear family, and at times played a role in political matters. One of the official changes to the organization during the modern era was the participation of black members in temple ceremonies, which began in 1978, reversing a policy originally instituted by Young. The church has also gradually changed its temple ceremony. There are also periodic changes in the structure and organization of the church, mainly to accommodate the organization's growth and increasing international presence. From the perspective of all subsequent denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement, Joseph Smith is universally recognized as the originator of their religious faith. Smith's initial following began to coalesce in the late 1820s while he was in the process of dictating the Book of Mormon. He stated that this book was a translation of characters from an ancient script referred to as reformed Egyptian, discovered on golden plates, which, according to his account, had been buried near his residence in western New York by an indigenous American prophet. Smith said he had been visited by the angel Moroni, who not only revealed the location of the plates but also prepared him for a prominent role as a religious leader.[5] On April 6, 1830, in western New York,[6] Smith organized the religion's first legal church entity, the Church of Christ. The church rapidly gained a following who viewed Smith as their prophet. In late 1830, Smith envisioned a \"city of Zion\", a utopian city in Native American lands near Independence, Missouri.[citation needed] In October 1830, he sent his Assistant President, Oliver Cowdery, and others on a mission to the area.[7][unreliable source?] Passing through Kirtland, Ohio, the missionaries converted a congregation of Disciples of Christ led by Sidney Rigdon, and in 1831, Smith decided to temporarily move his followers to Kirtland until lands in the Missouri area could be purchased. In the meantime, the church's headquarters remained in Kirtland from 1831 to 1838 and there the church built its first temple and continued to grow in membership from 680 to 17,881 members.[8] While the main church body was in Kirtland, many of Smith's followers attempted to establish settlements in Missouri but were met with resistance from other Missourians who believed Mormons were abolitionists, or who distrusted their political ambitions.[9] After Smith and other Mormons in Kirtland emigrated to Missouri in 1838, hostilities escalated into the 1838 Mormon War, culminating in adherents being expelled from the state under an Extermination Order signed by Lilburn W. Boggs, the governor of Missouri. After Missouri, Smith founded the city of Nauvoo, Illinois as the new church headquarters, and served as the city's mayor and leader of the Nauvoo Legion. As church leader, Smith also instituted the then-secret practice of plural marriage, and taught a political system he called \"theodemocracy\", to be led by a Council of Fifty which, allegedly, had secretly and symbolically anointed him king of this millennial theodemocracy.[10] On June 7, 1844, a newspaper called the Nauvoo Expositor, edited by dissident Mormon William Law, issued a scathing criticism of polygamy and the Nauvoo theocratic government, including a call for church reform based on earlier Mormon principles.[11] In response to the newspaper's publication, Smith and the Nauvoo City Council declared the paper a public nuisance, and ordered the press destroyed.[12] The town marshal carried out the order during the evening of June 10.[13] The destruction of the press led to charges of riot against Smith and other members of the council. After Smith surrendered on the charges, he was also charged with treason against Illinois. While in state custody, he and his brother Hyrum Smith, who was second in line to the church presidency, were killed in a firefight with an angry mob attacking the jail on June 27, 1844.[14] After Smith's death, a succession crisis ensued. In this crisis a number of church leaders campaigned to lead the church. Most adherents voted on August 8, 1844, to accept the argument of Brigham Young, the senior apostle, that there could be no true successor to Joseph Smith, but that the Twelve had all the required authority to lead the church, and were best suited to take on that role. Later, adherents bolstered their succession claims by referring to a March 1844 meeting in which Joseph committed the \"keys of the kingdom\" to a group of members within the Council of Fifty that included the apostles.[15] In addition, by the end of the 1800s, several of Young's followers had published reminiscences recalling that during Young's August 8 speech, he looked or sounded similar to Joseph Smith, to which they attributed the power of God.[16] Under the leadership of Brigham Young, church leaders planned to leave Nauvoo, Illinois in April 1846, but amid threats from the state militia, they were forced to cross the Mississippi River in the cold of February. They eventually left the boundaries of the United States to what is now Utah, where they founded Salt Lake City. The groups that left Illinois for Utah became known as the Mormon pioneers and forged a path to Salt Lake City known as the Mormon Trail. The arrival of the Mormon Pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847, is commemorated by the Utah State holiday Pioneer Day. Groups of converts from the United States, Canada, Europe, and elsewhere were encouraged to gather in Utah in the following decades. Both the original Mormon migration and subsequent convert migrations resulted in many deaths. Brigham Young organized a great colonization of the American West, with Mormon settlements extending from Canada to Mexico. Notable cities that sprang from early Mormon settlements include San Bernardino, California, Las Vegas, Nevada, and Mesa, Arizona. Following the death of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young stated that the church should be led by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (see succession crisis). Later, after the migration to Utah had begun, Young was sustained as a member of the First Presidency on December 25, 1847, (Wilford Woodruff Diary, Church Archives), and then as President of the Church on October 8, 1848. (Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church, 3:318). One of the reasons the Saints had chosen the Great Basin as a settling place was that the area was at the time outside the territorial borders of the United States, which Young had blamed for failing to protect Mormons from political opposition from the states of Missouri and Illinois. However, in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico ceded the area to the United States. As a result, Brigham Young sent emissaries to Washington, D.C. with a proposal to create a vast State of Deseret, of which Young would naturally be the first governor. Instead, Congress created the much smaller Utah Territory in 1850, and Young was appointed governor in 1851. Because of his religious position, Young exercised much more practical control over the affairs of Mormon and non-Mormon settlers than a typical territorial governor of the time. For most of the 19th century, the LDS Church maintained an ecclesiastical court system parallel to federal courts, and required Mormons to use the system exclusively for civil matters, or face church discipline. (Mangrum 1983, pp. 80–81) In 1856–1858, the church underwent what is commonly called the Mormon Reformation.[17] In 1855, a drought struck the flourishing territory. Very little rain fell, and even the dependable mountain streams ran very low. An infestation of grasshoppers and crickets destroyed whatever crops the Mormons had managed to salvage. During the winter of 1855–56, flour and other basic necessities were very scarce and costly. Heber C. Kimball wrote his son, \"Dollars and cents do not count now, in these times, for they are the tightest that I have ever seen in the territory of Utah.\" In September 1856, as the drought continued, the trials and difficulties led to an explosion of religious fervor. Jedediah M. Grant, a counselor in the First Presidency and a well-known conservative voice in the extended community, preached three days of fiery sermons to the people of Kaysville, Utah territory. He called for repentance and a general recommitment to moral living and religious teachings. 500 people presented themselves for \"rebaptism\" — a symbol of their determination to reform their lives. The zealous message spread from Kaysville to surrounding Mormon communities. Church leaders traveled around the territory, expressing their concern about signs of spiritual decay and calling for repentance. Members were asked to seal their rededication with rebaptism. Several sermons Willard Richards and George A. Smith had given earlier in the history of the church had touched on the concept of blood atonement, suggesting that apostates could become so enveloped in sin that the voluntary shedding of their own blood might increase their chances of eternal salvation. On September 21, 1856, while calling for sincere repentance, Brigham Young took the idea further, and stated: I know that there are transgressors, who, if they knew themselves and the only condition upon which they can obtain forgiveness, would beg of their brethren to shed their blood, that the smoke might ascend to God as an offering to appease the wrath that is kindled against them, and that the law might have its course. Journal of Discourses 4:43. This belief became ingrained in the church's public image during that period and drew widespread ridicule in Eastern newspapers, particularly in connection with the practice of polygamy. The notion faced consistent criticism from numerous Mormons and was ultimately disavowed as an official doctrine by the LDS Church in 1978. Nevertheless, in contemporary times, critics of the church and some popular writers continue to associate a formal doctrine of blood atonement with the Church.[citation needed] Throughout the winter special meetings were held and Mormons urged to adhere to the commandments of God and the practices and precepts of the church. Preaching placed emphasis on the practice of plural marriage, adherence to the Word of Wisdom, attendance at church meetings, and personal prayer. On December 30, 1856, the entire all-Mormon territorial legislature was re-baptized for the remission of their sins, and confirmed under the hands of the Twelve Apostles. As time went on, however, the sermons became intolerant and hysterical. In 1857–1858, the church was involved in an armed conflict with the U.S. government, now known as the Utah War. The settlers and the United States government battled for hegemony over the culture and government of the territory. Tensions over the Utah War, the murder of Mormon apostle Parley P. Pratt in Arkansas, and threats of violence from the Baker-Fancher wagon train (and possibly other factors),[citation needed] resulted in rogue Mormon settlers in southern Utah massacring a wagon train from Arkansas, known as Mountain Meadows massacre. The result of the Utah War was the succeeding of the governorship of the Utah territory from Brigham Young to Alfred Cumming, an outsider appointed by President James Buchanan. The church had attempted unsuccessfully to institute the United Order numerous times, most recently during the Mormon Reformation. In 1874, Young once again attempted to establish a permanent Order, which he now called the \"United Order of Enoch\" in at least 200 Mormon communities, beginning in St. George, Utah on February 9, 1874. In Young's Order, producers typically transferred ownership of their property to the Order itself. All members within the order would then collectively partake in the cooperative's net income, often distributed in proportion to the value of the property initially contributed. Occasionally, members received wages for their labor on the shared property. Much like Joseph Smith's United Order, Young's Order had a brief existence. By the time Young passed away in 1877, most of these United Orders had faltered. As the 19th century drew to a close, these Orders had effectively become extinct. Brigham Young died in August 1877. After his death, the First Presidency was not reorganized until 1880, when Young was succeeded by John Taylor, who in the interim had served as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. For several decades, polygamy was preached as God's law. Brigham Young, church president at that time, had quite a few wives, as did many other church leaders. This early practice of polygamy caused conflict between church members and the broader American society. In 1854, the Republican party referred in its platform to polygamy and slavery as the \"twin relics of barbarism.\" In 1862, the U.S. Congress enacted the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, signed by Abraham Lincoln, which made bigamy a felony in the territories punishable by $500 or five years in prison. The law also permitted the confiscation of church property[18] without compensation. However, this law was not enforced by the Lincoln administration or by Mormon-controlled territorial probate courts. Moreover, as Mormon polygamist marriages were performed in secret, it was difficult to prove when a polygamist marriage had taken place. In the meantime, Congress was preoccupied with the American Civil War. In 1874, after the war, Congress passed the Poland Act, which transferred jurisdiction over Morrill Act cases to federal prosecutors and courts, which were not controlled by Mormons. In addition, the Morrill Act was upheld in 1878 by the United States Supreme Court in the case of Reynolds v. United States. After Reynolds, Congress became even more aggressive against polygamy, and passed the Edmunds Act in 1882. The Edmunds Act prohibited not just bigamy, which remained a felony, but also bigamous cohabitation, which was prosecuted as a misdemeanor, and did not require proof an actual marriage ceremony had taken place. The Act also vacated the Utah territorial government, created an independent committee to oversee elections to prevent Mormon influence, and disenfranchised any former or present polygamist. Further, the law allowed the government to deny civil rights to polygamists without a trial. In 1887, Congress passed the Edmunds-Tucker Act, which allowed prosecutors to force plural wives to testify against their husbands, abolished the right of women to vote, disincorporated the church, and confiscated the church's property.[18] By this time, many church leaders had gone into hiding to avoid prosecution, and half the Utah prison population was composed of polygamists. Church leadership officially ended the practice in 1890, based on a revelation to Wilford Woodruff called the 1890 Manifesto. The church's modern era began soon after it renounced polygamy in 1890. Prior to the 1890 Manifesto, church leaders had been in hiding, many ecclesiastical matters had been neglected,[19] and the church organization itself had been disincorporated. With the reduction in federal pressure afforded by the Manifesto, however, the church began to re-establish its institutions. The 1890 Manifesto did not, itself, eliminate the practice of new plural marriages, as they continued to occur clandestinely, mostly with church approval and authority.[20] In addition, most Mormon polygamists and every polygamous general authority continued to cohabit with their polygamous wives.[21] Mormon leaders, including Woodruff, maintained that the Manifesto was a temporary expediency designed to enable Utah to obtain statehood, and that at some future date, the practice would soon resume.[22] Nevertheless, the 1890 Manifesto provided the church breathing room to obtain Utah's statehood, which it received in 1896 after a campaign to convince the American public that Mormon leaders had abandoned polygamy and intended to stay out of politics.[23] Despite being admitted to the United States, Utah was initially unsuccessful in having its elected representatives and senators seated in the United States Congress. In 1898, Utah elected general authority B.H. Roberts to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat. Roberts, however, was denied a seat there because he was practicing polygamy. In 1903, the Utah legislature selected Reed Smoot, also an LDS Church general authority but also a monogamist, as its first senator. From 1904 to 1907, the United States Senate conducted a series of Congressional hearings on whether Smoot should be seated. Eventually, the Senate granted Smoot a seat and allowed him to vote. However, the hearings raised controversy as to whether polygamy had actually been abandoned as claimed in the 1890 Manifesto, and whether the LDS Church continued to exercise influence on Utah politics. In response to these hearings, church president Joseph F. Smith issued a Second Manifesto denying that any post-Manifesto marriages had the church's sanction,[24] and announcing that those entering such marriages in the future would be excommunicated. The Second Manifesto did not annul existing plural marriages within the church, and the church tolerated some degree of polygamy into at least the 1930s. However, eventually the church adopted a policy of excommunicating its members found practicing polygamy and today seeks to actively distance itself from Mormon fundamentalist groups still practicing polygamy.[25] In modern times, members of the Mormon religion do not practice polygamy. However, if a Mormon man becomes widowed, he can be sealed to another woman while remaining sealed to his first wife. However, if a woman becomes widowed, she will not be allowed to be sealed to another man. She can be married by law, but not sealed in the temple. In 1870, the Utah Territory had become one of the first polities to grant women the right to vote—a right which the U.S. Congress revoked in 1887 as part of the Edmunds-Tucker Act. As a result, a number of LDS women became active and vocal proponents of women's rights. Of particular note was the LDS journalist and suffragist Emmeline B. Wells, editor of the Woman's Exponent, a Utah feminist newspaper. Wells, who was both a feminist and a polygamist, wrote vocally in favor of a woman's role in the political process and public discourse. National suffrage leaders, however, were somewhat perplexed by the seeming paradox between Utah's progressive stand on women's rights, and the church's stand on polygamy. In 1890, after the church officially renounced polygamy, U.S. suffrage leaders began to embrace Utah's feminism more directly, and in 1891, Utah hosted the Rocky Mountain Suffrage Conference in Salt Lake City, attended by such national feminist leaders as Susan B. Anthony and Anna Howard Shaw. The Utah Woman Suffrage Association, which had been formed in 1889 as a branch of the American Woman Suffrage Association (which in 1890 became the National American Woman Suffrage Association), was then successful in demanding that the constitution of the nascent state of Utah should enfranchise women. In 1896, Utah became the third state in the U.S. to grant women the right to vote. The LDS Church was actively involved in support of the temperance movement in the 19th century, and later, under the presidency of Heber J. Grant, the prohibition movement in the early 20th century.[26] Mormonism has had a mixed relationship with socialism in its various forms. In the earliest days of Mormonism, Joseph Smith had established a form of Christian communalism, an idea made popular during the Second Great Awakening, combined with a move toward theocracy. Mormons referred to this form of theocratic communalism as the United Order, or the law of consecration. While short-lived during the life of Joseph Smith, the United Order was re-established for a time in several communities of Utah during the theocratic political leadership of Brigham Young. Some aspects of secular socialism also found a place in the political views of Joseph Smith. He ran for President of the United States on a platform that included a nationalized bank aimed at addressing the abuses of private banks. In his role as a secular political leader in Nauvoo, Joseph Smith also implemented collective farms to ensure that the poor that were lacking property could sustain themselves and their families. Upon reaching Utah, under the guidance of Brigham Young, the Church leadership promoted collective ownership of industry. In 1876, they issued a circular that emphasized, \"The experience of mankind has shown that the people of communities and nations among whom wealth is the most equally distributed, enjoy the largest degree of liberty, are the least exposed to tyranny and oppression, and suffer the least from luxurious habits which beget vice.\" The circular, signed and endorsed by the Quorum of the Twelve and the First Presidency, further cautioned that without measures to prevent the continued concentration of wealth among the already rich and the worsening destitution among the poor, the nation could face disaster. History has shown that such a trend among once-powerful nations was a clear precursor to ruin.[27] In addition to religious socialism, many Mormons in Utah were receptive to the secular socialist movement that began in America during the 1890s. During the 1890s to the 1920s, the Utah Social Democratic Party, which became part of the Socialist Party of America in 1901, elected about 100 socialists to state offices in Utah. An estimated 40% of Utah Socialists were Mormon. Many early socialists visited the Church's cooperative communities in Utah with great interest and were well received by the Church leadership. Prominent early socialists such as Albert Brisbane, Victor Prosper Considerant, Plotino Rhodakanaty, Edward Bellamy, and Ruth & Reginald Wright Kauffman showed great interest in the successful cooperative communities of the Church in Utah. For example, while doing research for what would become a best selling socialist novel, Looking Backward, Edward Bellamy toured the Church's cooperative communities in Utah and visited with Lorenzo Snow for a week.[28] Ruth & Reginald Wright Kauffman also wrote a book, though this one non-fiction, after visiting the Church in Utah. Their book was titled The Latter Day Saints: A Study of the Mormons in the Light of Economic Conditions, which discussed the Church from a Marxist perspective. Plotino Rhodakanaty was also drawn to Mormonism and became the first Elder of the Church in Mexico after being baptized when a group of missionaries which included Moses Thatcher came to Mexico. Moses Thatcher kept in touch with Plotino Rhodakanaty for years following and was himself perhaps the most prominent member of the Church to have openly identified himself as a socialist supporter. Albert Brisbane and Victor Prosper Considerant also visited the church in Utah during its early years, prompting Considerant to note that \"thanks to a certain dose of socialist solidarity, the Mormons have in a few years attained a state of unbelievable prosperity\".[29] Attributing the peculiar socialist attitudes of the early Mormons to their success in the desert of the western United States was common even among those who were not themselves socialist. For instance, in his book History of Utah, 1540–1886, Hubert Howe Bancroft points out that the Mormons \"while not communists, the elements of socialism enter strongly into all their relations, public and private, social, commercial, and industrial, as well as religious and political. This tends to render them exclusive, independent of the gentiles and their government, and even in some respects antagonistic to them. They have assisted each other until nine out of ten own their farms, while commerce and manufacturing are to large extent cooperative. The rights of property are respected; but while a Mormon may sell his farm to a gentile, it would not be deemed good fellowship for him to do so.\"[30] While religious and secular socialism gained some acceptance among Mormons, the church was more circumspect about Marxist Communism, because of its acceptance of violence as a means to achieve revolution. From the time of Joseph Smith, the church had taken a favorable view as to the American Revolution and the necessity at times to violently overthrow the government, however the church viewed the revolutionary nature of Leninist Communism as a threat to the United States Constitution, which the church saw as divinely inspired to ensure the agency of man (Mormonism believes God revealed to Joseph Smith in Chapter 101 of the Doctrine and Covenants that \"the laws and constitution of the people ... I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles\"). In 1936, the First Presidency issued a statement stating: [I]t would be necessary to destroy our government before Communism could be set up in the United States. Since Communism, established, would destroy our American Constitutional government, to support Communism is treasonable to our free institutions, and no patriotic American citizen may become either a Communist or supporter of Communism. ... Communism being thus hostile to loyal American citizenship and incompatible with true church membership, of necessity no loyal American citizen and no faithful church member can be a Communist. In later years, such leaders as Ezra Taft Benson would take a stronger anti-Communist position publicly, his anti-Communism often being anti-leftist in general. However, Benson's views often brought embarrassment to the church leadership[citation needed], and when Benson was sent to Europe on a mission for the church, many[who?] believed this was a way of getting Benson out of the US where his right-wing views were a point of embarrassment for the church. While publicly claiming that this was not the reason for Benson's call to Europe, church president Joseph Fielding Smith wrote a letter to Congressman Ralph Harding stating that \"It would be better for him and for the church and all concerned, if he would settle down to his present duties and let all political matters take their course. He is going to take a mission to Europe in the near future and by the time he returns I hope he will get all the political notions out of his system.\" In another letter written in response to questions about how long Benson would be on his mission to Europe from U.S. Under-Secretary of State Averell Harriman, the church's first counselor in the First Presidency, Hugh B. Brown, responded: \"If I had my way, he'll never come back!\".[31] Later, Benson would become church president and backed off of his political rhetoric. Toward the end of his presidency, the church even began to discipline church members who had taken Benson's earlier hardline right-wing speeches too much to heart, some of whom claimed that the church had excommunicated them for adhering too closely to Benson's right-wing ideology.[32] Soon after the 1890 Manifesto, the LDS Church was in a dire financial condition. It was recovering from the U.S. crackdown on polygamy, and had difficulty reclaiming property that had been confiscated during polygamy raids. Meanwhile, there was a national recession beginning in 1893. By the late 1890s, the church was about $2 million in debt, and near bankruptcy.[33] In response, Lorenzo Snow, then President of the Church, conducted a campaign to raise the payment of tithing, of which less than 20% of LDS had been paying during the 1890s.[34] After a visit to Saint George, Utah, which had a much higher-than-average percentage of full 10% tithe-payers,[35] Snow felt that he had received a revelation.[36] This prompted him to promise adherents in various Utah settlements that if they paid their tithing, they would experience an outpouring of blessings, prosperity, the preparation for Zion, and protection of the LDS Church from its enemies; however, failure to pay tithing would result in the people being \"scattered.\"[37] As a result of Snow's vigorous campaign, tithing payment increased dramatically from 18.4% in 1898 to an eventual peak of 59.3% in 1910.[38] Eventually, payment of tithing would become a requirement for temple worship within the faith. During this timeframe, changes were made in stipends for bishops and general authorities. Bishops once received a 10% stipend from tithing funds, but are now purely volunteer. General authorities receive stipends, formerly received loans from church funds. As free public schools became available, the church closed or relinquished church-run \"stake academies\" and junior colleges in the 1920s (except Ricks College and Brigham Young Academy, now known as Brigham Young University-Idaho and Brigham Young University). In earlier times, Latter-day Saint meetings took place on Sunday morning and evening, with several meetings during the weekday. This arrangement was acceptable for Utah Saints, who generally lived within walking distance of a church building. Elsewhere other than Utah, however, this meeting schedule was seen as a logistical challenge. In 1980, the church introduced the \"Consolidated Meeting Schedule\", in which most church meetings were held on Sunday during a three-hour block. While promoting convenience and making church practice compatible with millions of non-Utahns, this new schedule has been criticized for eroding fellowshipping opportunities among North American Latter-day Saint youth. This erosion, in turn, has been blamed for decreasing LDS participation of young women to below that of young men, and for a downward trend in the percentage of LDS males who accept the call to serve a full-time mission.[a] In 2019, the meeting schedule was condensed into a two-hour block (with alternating meetings during the second hour). In 1982, the First Presidency announced that the length of service of male full-time missionaries would be reduced to 18 months. In 1984, a little more than two years later, it was announced that the length of service would be returned to its original length of 24 months.[39] The change was publicized as a way to increase the ability for missionaries to serve. At the time, missionaries paid for all their expenses in their country of service. The recession during the Carter presidency pushed inflation higher and the exchange rate lower. This sudden increase in costs together with already high costs of living in Europe and other industrialized nations resulted in a steady decline in the number of missionaries able to pay for two full years of service. The shortening of the required service time from 24 to 18 months cut off this decline in numbers, leveling out in the period following the reinstatement. For those in foreign missions, this was barely enough time to learn a more difficult language and difficulty with language was reported. Nevertheless, the shortened period of time also affected numbers of conversions: they declined by 7% annually during the same period. Some also saw the shortening as a weakening of faithfulness among those who were eventually called as missionaries, less length meaning less commitment required in terms of faith. However, it has also been seen as a recognition by the leadership of changes within the LDS cultural climate. Record economic growth starting in the mid-1980s mostly erased the problem of finances preventing service. As a secondary measure, starting in 1990, paying for a mission became easier on those called to work in industrialized nations. Missionaries began paying into a church-wide general missionary fund instead of paying on their own. This amount paid (about $425 per month currently) is used by the church to pay for the costs of all missionaries, wherever they go. This enabled those going to Bolivia, whose average cost of living is about $100 per month, to help pay for those going to Japan, whose cost tops out at around $900 per month. During the 1960s, the church aggressively pursued a Priesthood Correlation Program, which streamlined and centralized the structure of the church. It had begun earlier in 1908, as the Correlation Program. The program increased church control over viewpoints taught in local church meetings. During this time period, priesthood editorial oversight was established of formerly priesthood-auxiliary-specific YMMIA, YLMIA, Relief Society, Primary, and Sunday School magazines. In 1911, the church adopted the Scouting program for its male members of appropriate age. The Priesthood-Auxiliary movement (1928–1937) re-emphasized the church hierarchy around Priesthood, and re-emphasized other church organizations as \"priesthood auxiliaries\" with reduced autonomy. As the church began to collide and meld with cultures outside of Utah and the United States, the church began to jettison some of the parochialisms and prejudices that had become part of Latter-day Saint culture, but were not essential to Mormonism. In 1971, LDS General Authority and scholar Bruce R. McConkie drew parallels between the LDS Church and the New Testament church, who had difficulty embracing the Gentiles within Christianity, and encouraged members not to be so indoctrinated with social customs that they fail to engage other cultures in Mormonism. In 1987, Boyd K. Packer, another Latter-day Saint apostle, stated, \"We can't move [into various countries] with a 1947 Utah Church! Could it be that we are not prepared to take the gospel because we are not prepared to take (and they are not prepared to receive) all of the things we have wrapped up with it as extra baggage?\"[40] During and after the civil rights movement, the church faced a critical point in its history, where its previous attitudes toward other cultures and people of color, which had once been shared by much of the white American mainstream, began to appear racist and neocolonial. The church came under intense fire for its stances on black people and Native American issues.[citation needed] The cause of some of the church's most damaging publicity had to do with the church's policy of discrimination against black people. Black people were always officially welcome in the church, and Joseph Smith established an early precedent for it by ordaining black males to the Priesthood. Smith was also anti-slavery, going so far as to run on an anti-slavery platform as a candidate for the presidency of the United States. At times, however, Smith had shown sympathy for the belief that black people were the cursed descendants of Cain, a belief which was commonly held in his day. In 1849, church doctrine taught that even though black people could be baptized, black men could not be ordained to the Priesthood and black people could not enter LDS temples. Journal histories and public teachings of the time reflect that Young and others stated that God would some day reverse this policy of discrimination. It is also important to note that while black people as a whole were specifically withheld from priesthood blessings (although there were some exceptions to this policy in both the 1800s and 1900s), other races and genealogical lineages were also prohibited from holding the priesthood.[citation needed] By the late 1960s, the Church had expanded into Brazil, the Caribbean, and the nations of Africa, but it was also being criticized for its policy of racial discrimination. In the case of Africa and the Caribbean, the church had not yet begun large-scale missionary efforts in most areas. There were large groups of people who desired to join the church in Ghana and Nigeria and there were also many faithful church members who were of African descent in Brazil. On June 9, 1978, under the administration of Spencer W. Kimball, the church's leadership finally received sanction to change the long-standing policy.[41] Today, there are many black members of the church, and there are also many predominantly black congregations. In the Salt Lake City area, black members have organized branches of an official church auxiliary which is called the Genesis Groups. During the post-World War II period, the church also began to focus on expansion into a number of Native American cultures, as well as Oceanic cultures, which many Mormons considered to be the same ethnicity. These peoples were called \"Lamanites\", because they were all believed to descend from the Lamanite group in the Book of Mormon. In 1947, the church began the Indian Placement Program, where Native American students (upon request by their parents) were voluntarily placed in white Latter-day Saint foster homes during the school year, where they would attend public schools and become assimilated into Mormon culture. In 1955, the church began ordaining black Melanesians to the Priesthood. The church's policy toward Native Americans also came under fire during the 1970s. In particular the Indian Placement Program was criticized as neocolonial. In 1977, the U.S. government commissioned a study to investigate accusations that the church was using its influence to push children into joining the program. However, the commission rejected these accusations and found that the program was beneficial in many cases, and provided well-balanced American education for thousands, allowing the children to return to their cultures and customs. One issue was that the time away from family caused the assimilation of Native American students into American culture, rather than allowing the children to learn within, and preserve, their own culture. By the late 1980s, the program had been in decline, and in 1996, it was discontinued. In 2016, three lawsuits against the LDS Church were filed in the Navajo Nation District Court, alleging that participants in the program were sexually abused in their foster homes.[42] The Church has asked for the lawsuits to be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, arguing that the alleged abuse took place outside the reservation.[42] In 1981, the church published a new LDS edition of the Standard Works that changed a passage in The Book of Mormon that Lamanites (considered by many Latter-day Saints to be Native Americans) will \"become white and delightsome\" after accepting the gospel of Jesus Christ. Instead of continuing the original reference to skin color, the new edition replaced the word \"white\" with the word \"pure\", emphasizing inward spirituality. In 1927, the church implemented its \"Good Neighbor policy\", whereby it removed any suggestion in church literature, sermons, and ordinances that its members should seek vengeance on US citizens or governments, particularly for the assassinations of its founder Joseph Smith and his brother, Hyrum. The Church also reformed temple ordinance around this time. Beginning soon after the turn of the 20th century, four influential Latter-day Saint scholars began to systematize, modernize, and codify Mormon doctrine: B. H. Roberts, James E. Talmage, John A. Widtsoe, and Joseph Fielding Smith. In 1921, the church called chemistry professor John A. Widtsoe as an apostle. His writings, particularly Rational theology and Joseph Smith as Scientist, reflected the optimistic faith in science and technology that was pervasive at the time in American life. According to Widtsoe, all Mormon theology could be reconciled within a rational, positivist framework. The issue of evolution has been a point of controversy for some members of the church. The first official statement on the issue of evolution was in 1909, which marked the centennial of Charles Darwin's birth and the 50th anniversary of his masterwork, On the Origin of Species. On that year, the First Presidency led by Joseph F. Smith as president, issued a statement reinforcing the predominant religious view of creationism, and calling human evolution one of the \"theories of men\", but falling short of declaring evolution untrue or evil. \"It is held by some\", they said, \"that Adam was not the first man upon the earth, and that the original human was a development from lower orders of the animal creation. These, however, are the theories of men.\" Notably, the church did not opine on the evolution of animals other than humans, nor did it endorse a particular theory of creationism. Soon after the 1909 statement, Joseph F. Smith professed in an editorial that \"the church itself has no philosophy about the modus operandi employed by the Lord in His creation of the world.\"[43] Some also cite an additional editorial that enumerates various possibilities for creation including the idea that Adam and Eve: Proponents of evolution attribute this 1910 editorial to Joseph F. Smith and have sometimes identified it under the title \"First Presidency Instructions to the Priesthood: \"Origin of Man.\"[45] However, others have cast doubt on Joseph F. Smith's authorship of the editorial, which was published without attribution and seems to have contradicted contemporary views published elsewhere by Joseph F. Smith himself.[46][unreliable source?] They also contend that there is little evidence that the editorial represents \"First Presidency Instructions\" as the title under which it is often cited indicates. In 1925, as a result of publicity from the \"Scopes Monkey Trial\" concerning the right to teach evolution in Tennessee public schools, the First Presidency reiterated its 1909 stance, stating that \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, basing its belief on divine revelation, ancient and modern, declares man to be the direct and lineal offspring of Deity. ... . Man is the child of God, formed in the divine image and endowed with divine attributes.\" In the early 1930s there was an intense debate between liberal theologian and general authority B. H. Roberts and some members of the Council of the Twelve Apostles over attempts by B. H. Roberts to reconcile the fossil record with the scriptures by introducing a doctrine of pre-Adamic creation, and backing up this speculative doctrine using geology, biology, anthropology, and archeology[47] More conservative members of the Twelve Apostles, including Joseph Fielding Smith, rejected his speculation because it contradicted the idea that there was no death until after the fall of Adam. Scriptural references in the Book of Mormon such as 2 Nephi 2:22, Alma 12:23, and Doctrine and Covenants sec. 77:5-7 have been cited as teaching the doctrine that there was no death on the Earth before the Fall of Adam and Eve, and that the Earth's temporal existence consists of a total of seven thousand years (c.4,000 BC-c.2,000 AD). Some maintain that those scriptural references pertain to a spiritual death, although others disagree. It is clear, however, that the LDS Church does not conform to the same young-Earth creationist creed as many other faiths. The church has made it quite clear that the six days of creation are not necessarily six 24-hour periods. Brigham Young definitely addressed the issue,[48] and even the very anti-evolution Bruce R. McConkie taught that a day, in the Creation accounts, \"is a specified time period; it is an age, an eon, a division of eternity; it is the time between two identifiable events. And each day, of whatever length, has the duration needed for its purposes. ... There is no revealed recitation specifying that each of the 'six days' involved in the Creation was of the same duration\".[49] James E. Talmage published a book through the LDS Church that explicitly stated that organisms lived and died on this earth before the earth was fit for human habitation.[50] However, the official Church Educational System Student Manual teaches that there was no death before the Fall.[citation needed] The debate between different LDS leaders in 1931 prompted the First Presidency, then led by Heber J. Grant as president, to conclude: Upon the fundamental doctrines of the church we are all agreed. Our mission is to bear the message of the restored gospel to the world. Leave geology, biology, archaeology, and anthropology, no one of which has to do with the salvation of the souls of mankind, to scientific research, while we magnify our calling in the realm of the church. ... Upon one thing we should all be able to agree, namely, that Presidents Joseph F. Smith, John R. Winder, and Anthon H. Lund were right when they said: \"Adam is the primal parent of our race The debate over pre-Adamites has been interpreted by LDS proponents of evolution as a debate about organic evolution. This view, based on the belief that a dichotomy of thought on the subject of evolution existed between B. H. Roberts and Joseph Fielding Smith, has become common among pro-evolution members of the church. As a result, the ensuing 1931 statement has been interpreted by some as official permission for members to believe in organic evolution.[51] However, there is no evidence that the debate included the topic of evolution, and historically there was no strong disagreement between Joseph Fielding Smith and B. H. Roberts concerning evolution; they both rejected it, although to different degrees. B. H. Roberts wrote that the \"hypothesis\" of organic evolution was \"destructive of the grand, central truth of all revelation,\"[52] Later, Joseph Fielding Smith published his book Man: His Origin and Destiny, which denounced evolution without qualification. Similar statements of denunciation were made by Bruce R. McConkie, who as late as 1980 denounced evolution as one of \"the seven deadly heresies\",[53] and stated: \"There are those who say that revealed religion and organic evolution can be harmonized. This is both false and devilish.\" Evolution was also denounced by the conservative Ezra Taft Benson, who as an Apostle called on members to use the Book of Mormon to combat evolution and several times denounced evolution as a \"falsehood\" on a par with socialism, rationalism, and humanism.[54] A dichotomy of opinion exists among some church members today. Largely influenced by Smith, McConkie, and Benson, evolution is rejected by a large number of conservative church members.[55] A minority accept evolution, supported in part by the debate between B. H. Roberts and Joseph Fielding Smith, in part by a large amount of scientific evidence, and in part by Joseph F. Smith's words that \"the church itself has no philosophy about the modus operandi employed by the Lord in His creation of the world.\" Meanwhile, Brigham Young University, the largest private university owned and operated by the church, not only teaches evolution to its biology majors, but has also done significant research in evolution.[56] BYU-I, another church-run school, also teaches it.[57][58][59][60] The church was opposed to the Equal Rights Amendment.[61] In 1995, the church issued The Family: A Proclamation to the World. The church opposes same-sex marriage, but does not object to rights regarding hospitalization and medical care, fair housing and employment rights, or probate rights, so long as these do not infringe on the integrity of the family or the constitutional rights of churches and their adherents to administer and practice their religion free from government interference.[62] The church supported a gay rights bill in Salt Lake City which bans discrimination against gay men and lesbians in housing and employment, calling them \"common-sense rights\".[63][64] Some church members have formed a number of unofficial support organizations, including Evergreen International, Affirmation: Gay & Lesbian Mormons, North Star,[65] Disciples2,[66] Wildflowers,[67] Family Fellowship, GLYA (Gay LDS Young Adults),[68] LDS Reconciliation,[69] Gamofites and the Guardrail foundation.[70] Church leaders have met with people from Evergreen International, Inc. and several gay rights leaders.[71] In 1967, a set of papyrus manuscripts were discovered in the Metropolitan Museum of Art that appear to be the manuscripts from which Joseph Smith said to have translated the Book of Abraham in 1835. These manuscripts were presumed lost in the Chicago fire of 1871. Analyzed by Egyptologists, the manuscripts were identified as The Book of the Dead, an ancient Egyptian funerary text. Moreover, the scholars' translations of certain portions of the scrolls disagreed with Smith's translation. This discovery forced many Mormon apologists to moderate the earlier prevailing view that Smith's translations were literal one-to-one translations. As a result of this discovery, some Mormon apologists consider The Book of the Dead to be a starting-point that Smith used to reconstruct the original writings of Abraham through inspiration. In the early 1980s, the apparent discovery of an early Mormon manuscript, which came to be known as the \"Salamander Letter\", received much publicity. This letter, reportedly discovered by a scholar named Mark Hofmann, alleged that the Book of Mormon was given to Joseph Smith by a being that changed itself into a salamander, not by an angel as the official church history recounted. The document was purchased by private collector Steven Christensen, but was still significantly publicized and even printed in the church's official magazine, the Ensign. Some Mormon apologists, including apostle Dallin H. Oaks, suggested that the letter used the idea of a salamander as a metaphor for an angel.[citation needed] The document, however, was revealed as a forgery in 1985, and Hofmann was arrested for two murders related to his forgeries. Not all of Hofmann's findings have been deemed fraudulent.[citation needed] A document called the 'Anthon transcript' that allegedly contains reformed Egyptian characters from the Book of Mormon plates is still in dispute, although the characters have been highly circulated both by the church and other individuals.[citation needed] Due to Hofmann's methods, the authenticity of many of the documents he sold to the church and the Smithsonian will likely never be sorted out.[clarification needed][citation needed] In 1989, George P. Lee, a Navajo member of the First Quorum of the Seventy who had participated in the Indian Placement Program in his youth, was excommunicated. The church action occurred not long after he had submitted to the Church a 23-page letter critical of the program and the effect it had on Native American culture. In October 1994, Lee confessed to, and was convicted of, sexually molesting a 13-year-old girl in 1989. It is not known if church leaders had knowledge of this crime during the excommunication process. In the late 1980s, the administration of Ezra Taft Benson formed what it called the Strengthening Church Members Committee, to keep files on potential church dissidents and collect their published material for possible later use in church disciplinary proceedings. The existence of this committee was first publicized by an anti-Mormon ministry in 1991, when it was referred to in a memo dated July 19, 1990 leaked from the office of the church's Presiding Bishopric. At the 1992 Sunstone Symposium, dissident Mormon scholar Lavina Fielding Anderson accused the Committee of being \"an internal espionage system,\" which prompted Brigham Young University professor and moderate Mormon scholar Eugene England to \"accuse that committee of undermining the Church,\" a charge for which he later publicly apologized.[72] The publicity concerning the statements of Anderson and England, however, prompted the church to officially acknowledge the existence of the committee.[73] The Church explained that the Committee \"provides local church leadership with information designed to help them counsel with members who, however well-meaning, may hinder the progress of the church through public criticism.\"[74] The First Presidency also issued a statement on August 22, 1992, explaining its position that the committee had precedent and was justified based on a reference to D&C (LDS) Sec. 123, written while Joseph Smith was imprisoned in Liberty, Missouri, suggesting that a committee be formed to record and document acts of persecution against the church by the people of Missouri. Official concern about the work of dissident scholars within the church led to the excommunication or disfellowshipping of six such scholars, dubbed the September Six, in September 1993.[75] The church opposes the creation, distribution and viewing of pornography. Gordon B. Hinckley had been known to say that pornography is as addictive as the worst drugs.[76] He often talked of what a shame it is to use great resources like the internet for such purposes. By the 1960s and 1970s, as a consequence of its international growth in the post-World War II era, the church was no longer primarily a Utah-based church, but a worldwide organization. The church, mirroring the world around it, felt the disunifying strains of alien cultures and diverse points of view that had brought an end to the idealistic modern age. At the same time, the postmodern world was increasingly skeptical of traditional religion and authority, and driven by mass-media and public image. Thus, the church underwent a number of important changes in organization, practices, and meeting schedule. In addition, the church became more media-savvy, and more self-conscious and protective of its public image. The church also became more involved in public discourse, using its new-found political and cultural influence and the media to affect its image, public morality, and Mormon scholarship, and to promote its missionary efforts. At the same time, the church struggled with how to deal with increasingly pluralistic voices within the church and within Mormonism. In general, this period has seen both an increase in cultural and racial diversity and extra-faith ecumenism, and a decrease in intra-faith pluralism.[citation needed] Until the church's rapid growth after World War II, it had been seen in the eyes of the general public as a backward, non- or vaguely Christian polygamist cult in Utah — an image that interfered with proselytizing efforts. As the church's size began to merit new visibility in the world, the church seized upon the opportunity to re-define its public image, and to establish itself in the public mind as a mainstream Christian faith. At the same time, the church became publicly involved in numerous ecumenical and welfare projects that continue to serve as the foundation of its ecumenism today.[citation needed] In the 1960s the church formed the Church Information Service with the goal of being ready to respond to media inquiries and generate positive media coverage. The organization kept a photo file to provide photos to the media for such events as Temple dedications. It also would work to get stories covering Family Home Evening, the church welfare plan and the church's youth activities in various publications.[77] As part of the church's efforts to re-position its image as that of a mainstream religion, the church began to moderate its earlier anti–Roman Catholic rhetoric. In Elder Bruce R. McConkie's 1958 edition of Mormon Doctrine, he had stated his unofficial opinion that the Catholic Church was part of \"the church of the devil\" and \"the great and abominable church\" because it was among organizations that misled people away from following God's laws. In his 1966 edition of the same book, the specific reference to the Catholic Church was removed.[c] The first routinized system for teaching church principles to potential proselytes had been created in 1953 and named \"A Systematic Program for Teaching the Gospel\". In 1961, this system was enhanced, expanded, and renamed \"A Uniform System for Teaching Investigators\". This new system, in the form of a hypothetical dialogue with a fictional character named \"Mr. Brown\", included intricate details for what to say in almost every situation. These routinized missionary discussions would be further refined in 1973 and 1986, and then de-emphasized in 2003.[citation needed] In 1973, the church recast its missionary discussions, making them more family-friendly and focused on building on common Christian ideals. The new discussions, named \"A Uniform System for Teaching Families\", de-emphasized the Great Apostasy, which previously held a prominent position just after the story of the First Vision. When the discussions were revised in the early 1980s, the new discussions dealt with the apostasy less conspicuously, and in later discussions, rather than in the first discussion. The discussions also became more family-friendly, including a flip chart with pictures, in part to encourage the participation of children.[citation needed] According to Riess and Tickle, early Mormons rarely quoted from the Book of Mormon in their speeches and writings. It was not until the 1980s that it was cited regularly in speeches given by LDS Church leaders at the biannual General Conferences. In 1982, the LDS Church subtitled the Book of Mormon \"Another Testament of Jesus Christ.\" Apostle Boyd K. Packer stated that the scripture now took its place \"beside the Old Testament and the New Testament.[78] Riess and Tickle assert that the introduction of this subtitle was intended to emphasize the Christ-centered nature of the Book of Mormon. They assert that the LDS \"rediscovery of the Book of Mormon in the late twentieth century is strongly connected to their renewed emphasis on the person and nature of Jesus Christ.\"[79] In 1995, the church announced a new logo design that emphasized the words \"JESUS CHRIST\" in large capital letters, and de-emphasized the words \"The Church of\" and \"of Latter-day Saints\". According to Bruce L. Olsen, director of public affairs for the church, \"The logo re-emphasizes the official name of the church and the central position of the Savior in its theology. It stresses our allegiance to the Lord, Jesus Christ.\"[80] On January 1, 2000, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles released a proclamation entitled \"The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles\". This document commemorated the birth of Jesus and set forth the church's official view regarding Christ. In 2001, the church sent out a press release encouraging reporters to use the full name of the church at the beginning of news articles, with following references to the \"Church of Jesus Christ\". The release discouraged the use of the term \"Mormon Church\". The Church has participated in several interfaith cooperation initiatives. The church has opened its broadcasting facilities (Bonneville International) to other Christian groups, and has participated in the VISN Religious Interfaith Cable Television Network. The church has also participated in numerous joint humanitarian efforts with other churches. Lastly, the church has agreed not to baptize Holocaust victims by proxy. In 2004, the Church endorsed an amendment to the United States Constitution banning marriage except between a man and a woman. The Church also announced its opposition to political measures that \"confer legal status on any other sexual relationship\" than a \"man and a woman lawfully wedded as husband and wife.\"[81] On November 5, 2015, an update letter to LDS Church leaders for the Church Handbook was leaked. The policy banned a \"child of a parent living in a same-gender relationship\" from baby blessings, baptism, confirmation, priesthood ordination, and missionary service until the child was not living with their homosexual parent(s), was \"of legal age\", and \"disavow[ed] the practice of same-gender cohabitation and marriage\", in addition to receiving approval from the Office of the First Presidency. The policy update also added that entering a same-sex marriage as a type of \"apostasy\", mandating a disciplinary council.[82][83] The next day, in a video interview, apostle D. Todd Christofferson clarified that the policy was \"about love\" and \"protect[ing] children\" from \"difficulties, challenges, conflicts\" where \"parents feel one way and the expectations of the Church are very different\".[84] On November 13, the First Presidency released a letter clarifying that the policy applied \"only to those children whose primary residence is with a couple living in a same-gender marriage or similar relationship\" and that for children residing with parents in a same-sex relationship who had already received ordinances the policy would not require that \"privileges be curtailed or that further ordinances be withheld\".[85][86] The next day around 1,500 members gathered across from the Church Office Building to submit their resignation letters in response to the policy change with thousands more resigning online in the weeks after[87][88][89][90] Two months later, in a satellite broadcast, apostle Russell M. Nelson stated that the policy change was \"revealed to President Monson\" in a \"sacred moment\" when \"the Lord inspired [him] ... to declare ... the will of the Lord\".[91] In April 2019, the church—then led by Nelson—reversed these policies, citing efforts to be more accepting to people of all kinds of backgrounds.[92][93] For over 100 years, the church was a major sponsor of Scouting programs for boys, particularly in the United States. The LDS Church was the largest chartered organization in the Boy Scouts of America, having joined the Boy Scouts of America as its first charter organization in 1913.[94] In 2020, the church ended its relationship with the BSA and began an alternate, religion-centered youth program, which replaced all other youth programs.[95] Prior to leaving the Scouting program, LDS Scouts made up nearly 20 percent of all enrolled Boy Scouts,[96] more than any other church.[97] In 1887, the LDS Church was legally dissolved in the United States by the Edmunds–Tucker Act because of the church's practice of polygamy.[98] For more than the next hundred years, the church as a whole operated as an unincorporated entity.[99] During that time, tax-exempt corporations of the LDS Church included the Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which managed non-ecclesiastical real estate and other holdings; and the Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which governed temples, other sacred buildings, and the church's employees. By 2021, the two had been merged into one corporate entity, legally named \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\"[100] \"If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church.\" Gordon B. Hinckley, \"What Are People Asking About Us?\", Ensign, November 1998, p. 70.", "This Day In History: April 6 Changing the day will navigate the page to that given day in history. You can navigate days by using left and right arrows 1830 In Fayette, New York, Joseph Smith, founder of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as the Mormon Church), organizes the Church of Christ during a meeting with a small group of believers. Born in Vermont in 1805, Smith claimed in 1823 that he had been visited by a Christian angel named Moroni who spoke to him of an ancient Hebrew text that had been lost for 1,500 years. The holy text related the story of Israelite peoples who had lived in America in ancient times. Over the course of the next six years, Smith dictated an English translation of this text to his wife and other scribes, and in 1830 The Book of Mormon was published. In the same year, Smith founded the Church of Christ—later known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—in Fayette. The religion rapidly gained converts, and Smith set up LDS communities in Ohio, Missouri and Illinois. However, the Christian sect was also heavily criticized for its unorthodox practices, such as polygamy, and on June 27, 1844, Smith and his brother were murdered in a jail cell by an anti-LDS mob in Carthage, Illinois. Two years later, Smith’s successor, Brigham Young, led an exodus of persecuted Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo, Illinois, along the western wagon trails in search of religious and political freedom. In July 1847, the 148 initial LDS pioneers reached Utah’s Valley of the Great Salt Lake. Upon viewing the valley, Young declared, “This is the place,” and the pioneers began preparations for the tens of thousands of LDS migrants who would follow them and settle there.

All Rights Reserved.", "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, informally known as the LDS Church or Mormon Church, is a restorationist, nontrinitarian Christian denomination belonging to Mormonism. The church is headquartered in the United States in Salt Lake City, Utah and has established congregations and built temples worldwide. According to the church, it has over 17 million members and 62,544 full-time volunteer missionaries.[3] Based on these numbers, the church is the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States as of 2012,[9] and reported over 6.8 million US members as of 2022[update].[10] The church was founded as the Church of Christ in western New York, in 1830 by Joseph Smith during the Second Great Awakening. Under Smith's leadership, the church's headquarters moved successively to Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois. After Smith's 1844 death and a resultant succession crisis, the majority of his followers sided with Brigham Young, who led the church to its current headquarters in Salt Lake City. Young's successors continued the church's growth, first throughout the Intermountain West, and more recently as a national and international organization. It is by far the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement. Church theology includes the Christian doctrine of salvation through Jesus Christ, and his substitutionary atonement on behalf of mankind.[11] The church has an open canon of four scriptural texts: the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants (D&C), and the Pearl of Great Price. Other than the Bible, the majority of the church canon consists of material the church's members believe to have been revealed by God to Joseph Smith, including commentary and exegesis about the Bible, texts described as lost parts of the Bible, and other works believed to be written by ancient prophets, including the Book of Mormon. Because of doctrinal differences, many Christian groups consider the church to be distinct and separate from mainstream Christianity.[12] Latter-day Saints believe that the church president is a modern-day \"prophet, seer, and revelator\" and that Jesus Christ, under the direction of God the Father, leads the church by revealing his will and delegating his priesthood keys to its president. The president heads a hierarchical structure descending from areas to stakes and wards. Bishops, drawn from the laity, lead the wards. Male members may be ordained to the priesthood, provided they are living the standards of the church. Women are not ordained to the priesthood, but occupy leadership roles in some church organizations.[2] Both men and women may serve as missionaries. The church maintains a large missionary program that proselytizes and conducts humanitarian services worldwide. LDS Church also funds and participates in humanitarian projects independent of its missionary efforts.[13] Faithful members adhere to church laws of sexual purity, health, fasting, and Sabbath observance, and contribute ten percent of their income to the church in tithing. The church teaches sacred ordinances through which adherents make covenants with God, including baptism, confirmation, the sacrament, priesthood ordination, endowment and celestial marriage.[14] The church has been criticized throughout its history. Modern criticisms include disputed factual claims, treatment of minorities, and financial controversies. The church's practice of polygamy (plural marriage) was controversial until it was curtailed in 1890 and officially rescinded in 1904. The history of the church is typically divided into three broad time periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of Joseph Smith, which is in common with all churches associated with the Latter Day Saint movement, (2) a pioneer era under the leadership of Brigham Young and his 19th-century successors, and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century as Utah achieved statehood.[2] Joseph Smith formally organized the church as the Church of Christ, on April 6, 1830, in western New York.[b] Smith later changed the name to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints after he stated he had received a revelation to do so.[19] Initial converts were drawn to the church in part because of the newly published Book of Mormon, a self-described chronicle of indigenous American prophets that Smith said he had translated from golden plates.[20][21][22]: 57, 72, 90 Smith intended to establish the New Jerusalem in North America, called Zion.[15]: 122 [23][24] In 1831, the church moved to Kirtland, Ohio,[c][26]: 97 and began establishing an outpost in Jackson County, Missouri,[15]: 162 [26]: 109 where Smith planned to eventually move the church headquarters.[d] However, in 1833, Missouri settlers violently expelled the Latter Day Saints from Jackson County.[15]: 222–227 [e] The church attempted to recover the land through a paramilitary expedition, but did not succeed.[26]: 141, 146–159 [15]: 322 Nevertheless, the church flourished in Kirtland as Smith published new revelations and the church built the Kirtland Temple,[f][26]: 101 [30] culminating in a dedication of the building similar to the day of Pentecost.[15]: 310–319 [26]: 178 The Kirtland era ended in 1838, after a financial scandal rocked the church and caused widespread defections.[15]: 328–338 [31] Smith regrouped with the remaining church in Far West, Missouri,[g] but tensions soon escalated into violent conflicts with the old Missouri settlers.[15]: 357–364 [26]: 227–230 [33][34]: 97–98 Believing the Latter Day Saints to be in insurrection, the Missouri governor ordered that they be \"exterminated or driven from the State\".[h] In 1839, the Saints converted a swampland on the banks of the Mississippi River into Nauvoo, Illinois, which became the church's new headquarters.[15]: 383–384 Nauvoo grew rapidly as missionaries sent to Europe and elsewhere gained new converts who then flooded into Nauvoo.[15]: 409 [26]: 258, 264–65 Meanwhile, Smith introduced polygamy to his closest associates.[26]: 334–336 [15]: 437 He also established ceremonies, which he stated the Lord had revealed to him, to allow righteous people to become gods in the afterlife,[i] and a secular institution to govern the Millennial kingdom.[34]: 120–122 [j] He also introduced the church to a full accounting of his First Vision, in which two heavenly \"personages\" appeared to him at age 14.[k] This vision would come to be regarded by the LDS Church as the most important event in human history since the resurrection of Jesus.[41] On June 27, 1844, Smith and his brother, Hyrum, were killed by a mob in Carthage, Illinois,[26]: 393–394 [15] while being held on charges of treason.[42] Because Hyrum was Joseph's designated successor, their deaths caused a succession crisis,[34]: 143 [26]: 398 and Brigham Young assumed leadership over a majority of the church's membership.[15]: 556–557 Young had been a close associate of Smith's and was the senior apostle of the Quorum of the Twelve. Other splinter groups followed other leaders around this time. These groups have no affiliation with the LDS Church,[34]: 198–211 however they share a common heritage in their early church history. Collectively, they are called the Latter Day Saint movement. The largest of these smaller groups is the Community of Christ, based in Independence, Missouri, followed by the Church of Jesus Christ, based in Monongahela, Pennsylvania. Like the LDS Church, these faiths believe in Joseph Smith as a prophet and founder of their religion. They also accept the Book of Mormon, and most accept at least some version of the D&C. However, they tend to disagree to varying degrees with the LDS Church concerning doctrine and church leadership.[43][44] For two years after Smith's death, conflicts escalated between Mormons and other Illinois residents. Brigham Young led his followers, later called the Mormon pioneers, westward to Nebraska and then in 1847 on to what later became the Utah Territory,[45] which at the time had been part of the indigenous lands of the Ute, Goshute, and Shoshone nations, and claimed by Mexico until 1848.[46]: 28, 249–250, 365 [47] Around 80,000 settlers arrived between 1847 and 1869,[48] who then branched out and colonized a large region now known as the Mormon Corridor. Young incorporated the LDS Church as a legal entity, and initially governed both the church and the state as a theocratic leader. He also publicized the practice of plural marriage in 1852. Modern research suggests that around 20 percent of Mormon families may have participated in the practice.[2] By 1857, tensions had again escalated between Mormons and other Americans, largely as a result of accusations involving polygamy and the theocratic rule of the Utah Territory by Young.[49] The Utah Mormon War ensued from 1857 to 1858, which resulted in the relatively peaceful invasion of Utah by the United States Army. The most notable instance of violence during this conflict was the Mountain Meadows massacre, in which leaders of a local Mormon militia ordered the massacre of a civilian emigrant party who was traveling through Utah during the escalating military tensions.[5]: 120–123 After the massacre was discovered, the church became the target of significant media criticism for it.[50] After the Army withdrew, Young agreed to step down from power and be replaced by a non-Mormon territorial governor, Alfred Cumming. Nevertheless, the LDS Church still wielded significant political power in the Utah Territory.[51] Coterminously, tensions between Mormon settlers and indigenous tribes continued to escalate as settlers began colonizing a growing area of tribal lands. While Mormons and indigenous peoples made attempts at peaceful coexistence, skirmishes ensued from about 1849 to 1873 culminating in the armed conflicts of Walkara's War, the Bear River Massacre, and the Black Hawk War. After Young's death in 1877, he was followed by other church presidents, who resisted efforts by the United States Congress to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages. In 1878, the United States Supreme Court, in Reynolds v. United States, decreed that \"religious duty\" to engage in plural marriage was not a valid defense to prosecutions for violating state laws against polygamy. Conflict between Mormons and the U.S. government escalated to the point that, in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized most of its assets. Soon thereafter, church president Wilford Woodruff issued a manifesto that officially suspended the performance of new polygamous marriages in the United States.[52] Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. Relations further improved after 1904, when church president Joseph F. Smith again disavowed polygamy before the United States Congress and issued a \"Second Manifesto\", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of excommunicating its members found practicing polygamy.[53] Some fundamentalist groups with relatively small memberships have broken off and continue to practice polygamy, but the Church distances itself from them.[54][55] During the 20th century, the church grew substantially and became an international organization. In 2000, the church reported over 60,000 missionaries and global church membership stood at just over 11 million.[56] Nominal worldwide membership surpassed 16 million in 2018. Slightly under half of church membership lives within the United States.[57] The church has become a strong proponent of the nuclear family and at times played a prominent role in political matters, including opposition to MX Peacekeeper missile bases in Utah and Nevada,[58] the Equal Rights Amendment,[58] legalized gambling,[59] same-sex marriage,[60]: 2 and physician-assisted death.[61] A number of official changes have taken place to the organization during the modern era. In 1978, the church reversed its previous policy of excluding black men of African descent from the priesthood, which had been in place since 1852;[62]: 70 members of all races can now be ordained to the priesthood. Also, since the early 1900s, the church has instituted a Priesthood Correlation Program to centralize church operations and bring them under a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. During the Great Depression, the church also began operating a church welfare system, and it has conducted humanitarian efforts in cooperation with other religious organizations such as Catholic Relief Services, as well as secular organizations like Care International.[63][64] During the second half of the 20th century and beginnings of the 21st, the church has responded to various challenges to its doctrine and authority. Challenges have included rising secularization,[65][66] challenges to the correctness of the translation of the Book of Abraham,[67][68] and primary documents forged by Mark Hofmann purporting to contradict important aspects of official early church history.[69] The church's positions regarding homosexuality, women, and black people have all been publicly criticized during this timeframe. For over 100 years, the church was a major sponsor of Scouting programs for boys, particularly in the United States. The LDS Church was the largest chartered organization in the Boy Scouts of America, having joined the Boy Scouts of America as its first charter organization in 1913.[70] In 2020, the church ended its relationship with the BSA and began an alternate, religion-centered youth program, which replaced all other youth programs.[71] Prior to leaving the Scouting program, LDS Scouts made up nearly 20 percent of all enrolled Boy Scouts,[72] more than any other church.[73] LDS Church theology includes the belief in a Godhead composed of God the Father, his son, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three separate Persons who share a unity of purpose or will; however, they are viewed as three distinct Beings making one Godhead. This is in contrast with the predominant Christian view, which holds that God is a Trinity of three distinct persons in one essence. The Latter-day Saint conception of the Godhead is similar to what contemporary Christian theologians call social trinitarianism.[74] The beliefs of the church also include the belief that God the Father and his son, Jesus Christ, are separate beings with bodies of flesh and bone, while the Holy Ghost lacks such a physical body.[75] According to statements by church leaders, God sits at the head of the human family and is married to a Heavenly Mother, who is the mother of human spirits.[76] However, church leaders have also categorically discouraged prayers to her and counseled against speculation regarding her.[77] Church members believe in Jesus Christ as the literal Son of God and Messiah, his crucifixion as a conclusion of a sin offering, and subsequent resurrection.[78][79]: 171–172 However, Latter-day Saints reject the ecumenical creeds and the definition of the Trinity.[80] Jesus is also seen as the elder brother of all who live in this world.[79]: 155 The church teaches that Jesus performed a substitutionary atonement; in contrast with other Christian denominations, the church teaches this atonement began in the garden of Gethsemane and continued it to his crucifixion (rather than the orthodox belief that the crucifixion alone was the physical atonement).[79]: 178, 291 The church also teaches that Christ appeared to other peoples after his death, including spirits of the dead in the spirit world,[78][79]: 211 and indigenous Americans.[80][78][81] The church also teaches that Jesus is the true founder and leader of the church itself.[82] The physical establishment of the church by Smith in 1830 is seen as simply the reestablishment of the same primitive church that existed under Jesus and his Apostles.[83]: 37 Similarly, the church teaches that Jesus leads the church presently through its apostles and prophets,[84] especially its current president.[83]: 38 The LDS Church shares various teachings with other branches of Christianity. These include a belief in the Bible,[85] the divinity of Jesus, and his atonement and resurrection. LDS theology also includes belief in the doctrine of salvation through Jesus alone, restorationism, millennialism, continuationism, conditional substitutionary atonement[11] or penal substitution,[86] and a form of apostolic succession.[l] Nevertheless, the LDS Church differs from other churches within contemporary Christianity in other ways. Differences between the LDS Church and most of traditional Christianity include disagreement about the nature of God, belief in a theory of human salvation that includes three heavens, a doctrine of exaltation which includes the ability of humans to become gods and goddesses in the afterlife,[90][91] a belief in continuing revelation and an open scriptural canon, and unique ceremonies performed privately in temples, such as the endowment and sealing ceremonies. A number of major Christian denominations view the LDS Church as standing apart from creedal Christianity.[m][12] However, church members self-identify as Christians.[97] The faith itself views other modern Christian faiths as having departed from true Christianity by way of a general apostasy and maintains that it is a restoration of 1st-century Christianity and the only true and authorized Christian church. Church leaders assert it is the only true church and that other churches do not have the authority to act in Jesus' name.[n] The church's cosmology and plan of salvation include the doctrines of a pre-existence, an earthly mortal existence, three degrees of heaven and exaltation. According to these doctrines, every human spirit is a spiritual child of a Heavenly Father and each has the potential to continue to learn, grow, and progress in the eternities, eventually achieving eternal life, which is to become one with God in the same way that Jesus Christ is one with the Father, thus allowing the children of God to become divine beings—that is, gods—themselves.[100]: 74 This view on the doctrine of theosis is also referred to as becoming a \"joint-heir with Christ\".[90] The process by which this is accomplished is called exaltation, a doctrine which includes the reunification of the mortal family after the resurrection and the ability to have spirit children in the afterlife and inherit a portion of God's kingdom.[90][101] To obtain this state of godhood, the church teaches that one must have faith in Jesus Christ, repent of his or her sins, strive to keep the commandments faithfully, and participate in ordinances. According to LDS Church theology, men and women may be sealed to one another so that their marital bond continues into the eternities.[o] Children may also be sealed to their biological or adoptive parents to form permanent familial bonds, thus allowing all immediate and extended family relations to endure past death.[p][107][108] The most significant LDS ordinances may be performed via proxy in behalf of those who have died, such as baptism for the dead. The church teaches that all will have the opportunity to hear and accept or reject the gospel of Jesus Christ, either in this life or the next.[109][110] Within church cosmology, the fall of Adam and Eve is seen positively. The church teaches that it was essential to allow humankind to experience separation from God, to exercise full agency in making decisions for their own happiness.[111][112][113] The LDS Church teaches that, subsequent to the death of Jesus and his original apostles, his church, along with the authority to act in Jesus Christ's name and the church's attendant spiritual gifts, were lost, due to a combination of external persecutions and internal heresies.[83]: 33 The restoration—as represented by the church began by Joseph Smith—refers to a return of the authentic priesthood power, spiritual gifts, ordinances, living prophets and revelation of the primitive Church of Christ.[114][115] This restoration is associated with a number of events which are understood to have been necessary to re-establish the early Christian church found in the New Testament, and to prepare the earth for the Second Coming of Jesus.[116] In particular, Latter-day Saints believe that angels appeared to Joseph Smith and a limited number of his associates, and bestowed various priesthood authorities on them. The church is led by a president, who is considered a \"prophet, seer, and revelator.\" Within the church, he is referred to as \"the Prophet\" or the \"President of the Church.\" He is considered the only person who is authorized to receive revelation from God on behalf of the whole world or entire church. As such, the church teaches that he is essentially infallible when speaking on behalf of God—although the exact circumstances when his pronouncements should be considered authoritative are debated within the church.[117][118] In any case, modern declarations with broad doctrinal implications are often issued by joint statement of the First Presidency; they may be joined by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as well.[119][120] Church members believe Joseph Smith was the first modern-day prophet.[121] Normally, the Prophet and two other ordained apostles he chooses as counselors form the First Presidency, the presiding body of the church; twelve other apostles form the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.[122] When a president dies, his successor is chosen from the remaining apostles, and is invariably the longest-tenured of the group.[123] Following the death of church president Thomas S. Monson on January 2, 2018,[124] senior apostle Russell M. Nelson was announced as president on January 16.[125] The church and its members consider marriage and family highly important, with emphasis placed on large, nuclear families.[2] In 1995, the church's First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve issued \"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\", which asserts the importance of a heterosexual, nuclear family. The proclamation defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman and stated that the family unit is \"central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children.\" The document further says that \"gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose,\" that the father and mother have differing roles as \"equal partners\" (with the father presiding) in raising children, and that successful marriages and families, founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ, can last eternally.[126][60]: 52–54 [127] The proclamation also promotes specific roles essential to maintaining the strength of the family unit—the roles of a husband and father as the family's breadwinner and spiritual leader and those of a wife and mother as a nurturing caregiver. Both parents are charged with the duties of childrearing.[2] Senior church leaders have continued to emphasize conservative teachings on marriage and gender to the present time.[128] LDS Church members are encouraged to set aside one evening each week, typically Monday, to spend together in \"Family Home Evening.\" Family Home Evenings typically consist of gathering as a family to study the faith's gospel principles, and other family activities. Daily family prayer is also encouraged.[2] The theology of the LDS Church consists of a combination of biblical doctrines with modern revelations and other commentary by LDS leaders, particularly Joseph Smith. The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the \"standard works\". Included in the standard works are the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the D&C and the Pearl of Great Price.[129] The Book of Mormon is a foundational sacred book for the church; the terms \"Mormon\" and \"Mormonism\" come from the book itself. The LDS Church teaches that the Angel Moroni told Smith about golden plates containing the record, guided him to find them buried in the Hill Cumorah, and provided him the means of translating them from Reformed Egyptian. It claims to give a history of the inhabitants from a now-extinct society living on the American continent and their distinct Judeo-Christian teachings. The Book of Mormon is very important to modern Latter-day Saints, who consider it the world's most perfect text.[130] The Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be the word of God—subject to an acknowledgment that its translation may be incorrect, or that authoritative sections may have been lost over the centuries. Most often, the church uses the Authorized King James Version.[85] Two extended portions of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible have been canonized and are thus considered authoritative.[q] Additionally, over 600[131] of the more doctrinally significant verses from the translation are included as excerpts in the current LDS Church edition of the Bible.[132] Other revelations from Smith are found in the D&C, and in the Pearl of Great Price.[2] Another source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the First Presidency. The church teaches that the First Presidency and the Quorum of Twelve Apostles are prophets[133] and that they are therefore authorized teachers of God's word.[134] In addition to doctrine given by the church as a whole, individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives,[135] and in revealing truth to them, especially about spiritual matters. Generally, this is said to occur through thoughts and feelings from the Holy Ghost, in response to prayer.[136] Similarly, the church teaches its members may receive individual guidance and counsel from God through blessings from priesthood holders. In particular, patriarchal blessings are considered special blessings that are received only once in the recipient's life, which are recorded, transcribed, and archived.[137]: 239 In the church, an ordinance is a sacred rite or ceremony that has spiritual and symbolic meanings, and acts as a means of conveying divine grace. Ordinances are physical acts which signify or symbolize an underlying spiritual act; for some ordinances, the spiritual act is the finalization of a covenant between the ordinance recipient and God. Ordinances are generally performed under priesthood authority. The ordinance of baptism is believed to bind its participant to Jesus Christ, who saves them in their imperfection if they continually keep their promises to him.[138] Baptism is performed by immersion, and is typically administered to children starting at age eight. Church members believe that through the ordinances of temple sealing and temple endowment, anyone can reach the highest level of salvation in the celestial kingdom and eternally live in God's presence, continue as families, become gods, create worlds, and make spirit children over whom they will govern.[101][90][91] Other ordinances performed in the church include confirmation, the sacrament (equivalent to the Eucharist or holy communion), and priesthood ordination. The LDS Church asks its members to adhere to a dietary code called the Word of Wisdom, in which they abstain from the consumption of alcohol, coffee, tea, tobacco, and illicit or harmful substances.[139] The Word of Wisdom also encourages the consumption of herbs and grains along with the moderate consumption of meat.[2] When Joseph Smith published the Word of Wisdom in 1833, it was considered only advice; violation did not restrict church membership. During the 1890s, though, church leaders started emphasizing the Word of Wisdom more. In 1921, church president Heber J. Grant made obeying the Word of Wisdom a requirement to engage in worship inside of the faith's temples. From that time, church leadership has emphasized the forbidding of coffee, tea, tobacco, and alcohol, but not the other guidelines concerning meat, grains, and herbs.[2] Church members are expected to follow a moral code called the law of chastity, which prohibits adultery, homosexual behavior, and sexual relations before or outside of marriage.[85]: 1 As part of the law of chastity, the church strongly opposes pornography, and considers masturbation an immoral act.[140] Church members are expected to donate one-tenth of their income to support the operations of the church (e.g. temple and meetinghouse operation and construction, etc.), with an estimated annual donation of $7 billion[141][142] to $33 billion[143] USD donated in 2012 (equivalent to $8.9 billion to $42.1 billion in 2022[144]). In order to qualify for temple ordinances necessary for salvation, paying a full tithe is a requirement, regardless of one's temporal circumstances.[145][146][147][148] Members are also encouraged to fast (abstain from food and drink) on the first Sunday of each month for two consecutive meals. They donate at least the cost of the two skipped meals of the fast as a \"fast offering\", which the church uses to assist people in need and expand its humanitarian efforts.[149] Local leadership is not paid, and is expected to tithe as well. Full-time missionaries, however, are not expected to pay tithing as they are usually paying to be a missionary.[150] Starting in the late 1960s, serving a two-year, full-time proselytizing mission became expected for all able-bodied LDS young men.[151][152][153] Missionaries do not choose where they serve or the language in which they will proselytize, and are expected to fund their missions themselves or with the aid of their families.[2] Prospective male missionaries must be at least 18 years old and no older than 25, and have completed secondary school.[154] Missionary service is not compulsory, nor is it required for young men to retain their church membership.[155] Unmarried women 19 years and older may also serve as missionaries,[151] generally for a term of 18 months. Though not expected,[156] in recent years there is increasing cultural pressure for women to serve missions too, and there is no maximum age for missionary service for women.[151] Retired couples are also encouraged to serve missions, and may serve from 6–23 months terms.[156] Unlike younger missionaries, these senior missionaries may serve in non-proselytizing capacities such as humanitarian aid workers or family history specialists.[156] Other men and women who desire to serve a mission, but may not be able to perform full-time service in another state or country due to health issues, may serve in a non-proselytizing mission. They might assist at Temple Square in Salt Lake City or aid in the seminary system in schools.[157] All proselytizing missionaries are organized geographically into administrative areas called missions. The efforts in each mission are directed by an older adult male mission president. As of July 2020, there were 407 missions of the church.[158] Church members are expected to set aside Sundays as a day of rest and worship. Typically, weekly worship meetings occur solely on Sundays. Shopping and recreation are discouraged on Sundays as well.[4]: 456 Meetings for worship and study are held at meetinghouses, which are typically utilitarian in character.[2] The main focus of Sunday worship is the Sacrament meeting, where the sacrament is passed to church members; sacrament meetings also include prayers, the singing of hymns by the congregation or choir, and impromptu or planned sermons by church laity. Also included in weekly meetings are times for Sunday School, or separate instructional meetings based on age and gender, including the Relief Society for women. Church congregations are organized geographically.[4]: 150 Members are generally expected to attend the congregation with their assigned geographical area; however, some geographical areas also provide separate congregations for young single adults, older single adults, or for speakers of alternate languages.[4]: 151 For Sunday services, the church is grouped into either larger congregations known as wards, or smaller congregations known as branches.[4]: 152 Regional church organizations, encompassing multiple congregations, include stakes,[4]: 175 missions, districts and areas.[159] The church's Young Men and Young Women organizations meet at the meetinghouse once a week, on a day other than Sunday, where the youth participate in activities. In LDS theology, a temple is considered to be a holy building, dedicated as a \"House of the Lord\" and held as more sacred than a typical meetinghouse or chapel. In temples, church members participate in ceremonies that are considered the most sacred in the church, including marriage, and an endowment ceremony that includes a washing and anointing, receiving a temple garment, and making covenants with God. Baptisms for the dead—as well as other temple ordinances on behalf of the dead[2]—are performed in the temples as well. Temples are considered by church members to be the most sacred structures on earth, and as such, operating temples are not open to the public. Permission to enter is reserved only for church members who pass periodic interviews with ecclesiastical leaders and receive a special recommendation card, called a temple recommend, that they present upon entry.[2] Church members are instructed not to share details about temple ordinances with non-members or even converse about them outside the temple itself.[2] As of May 2023, there are 177 operating temples worldwide.[160] In order to perform ordinances in temples on behalf of deceased family members, the church emphasizes genealogical research, and encourages its lay members to participate in genealogy.[161] It operates FamilySearch, the largest genealogical organization in the world.[162] Twice each year, general authorities address the worldwide church through general conference. General conference sessions are translated into as many as 80 languages and are broadcast from the 21,000-seat[163] Conference Center in Salt Lake City. During this conference, church members formally acknowledge, or \"sustain\", the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators.[164] Individual stakes also hold formal conferences within their own boundaries biannually; wards hold conferences annually.[165] The church teaches that it is a continuation of the Church of Christ established in 1830 by Joseph Smith. This original church underwent several name changes during the 1830s, being called the Church of Christ and the Church of Jesus Christ;[8] in 1834, the name was officially changed to the Church of the Latter Day Saints.[166] In April 1838, the name was officially changed to \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\".[166][16]: 160 After Smith died, Brigham Young and the largest body of Smith's followers incorporated the LDS Church in 1851 by legislation of the State of Deseret under the name \"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\",[r] which included a hyphenated \"Latter-day\" and a British-style lower-case d.[167] Common informal names for the church include the LDS Church, the Latter-day Saints, and the Mormons. The term Mormon Church is in common use.[170] The church requests that the official name be used when possible or, if necessary, shortened to \"the Church\", \"the Church of Jesus Christ\",[8] or \"Latter-day Saints\".[8] In August 2018, church president Russell M. Nelson asked members of the church and others to cease using the terms \"LDS\", \"Mormon\" and \"Mormonism\" to refer to the church, its membership, or its belief system and instead to call the church by its full and official name.[171][172][s] Subsequent to this announcement, the church's premier vocal ensemble, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, was officially renamed and became the \"Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square\".[174] Reaction to the name change policy has been mixed.[175] Legally, the church currently functions as a corporation sole, incorporated in Utah.[176] Intellectual Reserve is a nonprofit corporation wholly owned by the church, which holds the church's intellectual property, such as copyrights, trademarks, and other media.[177] The LDS Church is organized in a hierarchical priesthood structure administered by its male members. Members of the church-wide leadership are called general authorities.[t] They exercise both ecclesiastical and administrative leadership over the church and direct the efforts of regional leaders down to the local level. General authorities and mission presidents work full-time for the church, and typically receive stipends from church funds or investments.[178] As well as speaking in general conference, general authorities speak to church members in local congregations throughout the world; they also speak to youth[179] and young adults[180] in broadcasts and at the Church Educational System (CES) schools, such as Brigham Young University (BYU).[181] Local congregations are typically led by bishops, who perform similar functions to pastors in the Protestant tradition, or parish priests in the Roman Catholic Church.[182] All males who are living the standards of the church are generally considered for the priesthood and are ordained to the priesthood as early as age 11.[183] Ordination occurs by a ceremony where hands are laid on the head of the one ordained. The priesthood is divided into an order for young men aged 11 years and older (called the Aaronic priesthood) and an order for men 18 years of age and older (called the Melchizedek priesthood).[2][4]: 26 Additional authorities within the priesthood – called priesthood keys – are extended to holders of certain church leadership callings. Some church leaders and scholars have spoken of women holding or exercising priesthood power.[184] However, women are not formally ordained to the priesthood, and they do not participate in public functions administered by the priesthood—such as passing the Sacrament, giving priesthood blessings, or holding leadership positions over congregations as a whole. Since 2013, the Ordain Women organization has sought formal priesthood ordination for women.[185] Each active church member is expected to receive a calling, or position of assigned responsibility within the church. Church members are expected to neither ask for specific callings, nor decline callings that are extended to them by their leaders. Leadership positions in the church's various congregations are filled through the calling system, and the vast majority of callings are filled on a volunteer basis.[u][v] Members volunteer general custodial work for local church facilities.[189] Under the leadership of the priesthood hierarchy are five organizations that fill various roles in the church: Relief Society, the Young Men and Young Women organizations, Primary, and Sunday School.[2] Women serve as presidents and counselors in the presidencies of the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary, while men serve as presidents and counselors of the Young Men and Sunday School.[190] The church also operates several programs and organizations in the fields of proselytizing, education, and church welfare such as LDS Humanitarian Services. Many of these organizations and programs are coordinated by the Priesthood Correlation Program, which is designed to provide a systematic approach to maintain worldwide consistency, orthodoxy, and control of the church's ordinances, doctrines, organizations, meetings, materials, and other programs and activities.[191][5]: 184–215 The church operates CES, which includes BYU, BYU–Idaho, BYU–Hawaii, and Ensign College. The church also operates Institutes of Religion near the campuses of many colleges and universities. For high-school aged youth, the church operates a four-year Seminary program, which provides religious classes for students to supplement their secular education.[2] The church also sponsors a low-interest educational loan program known as the Perpetual Education Fund, which provides educational opportunities to students from developing nations.[192][193] The church's welfare system, initiated in 1930 during the Great Depression, provides aid to the poor. Leaders ask members to fast once a month and donate the money they would have spent on those meals to help the needy, in what is called a fast offering.[2] Money from the program is used to operate Bishop's storehouses, which package and store food at low cost. Distribution of funds and food is administered by local bishops. The church also distributes money through its Philanthropies division to disaster victims worldwide.[194] Other church programs and departments include Family Services, which provides adoption resource referrals, marital and family counseling, psychotherapy, and addiction counseling;[195] the LDS Church History Department, which collects church history and records; and the Family History Department, which administers the church's large family history efforts, including FamilySearch, the world's largest family history library and organization.[162][196] Other facilities owned and operated by the church include Temple Square, the Church Office Building, the Church Administration Building, the Church History Library and the Granite Mountain Records Vault. Since 1941, the church has been classified by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) organization and is therefore tax-exempt. Donations are tax-deductible in the United States.[197] The church has not released church-wide financial statements since 1959.[198] In the absence of official statements, people interested in knowing the church's financial status and behavior, including both members of the church and people outside the church, have attempted to estimate or guess.[199] In 1997, Time magazine called the LDS Church one of the world's wealthiest churches per capita.[200] The church has stated that its for-profit, non-profit, and educational subsidiary entities are all audited by professionals independent from other church entities.[201] The church receives significant funds from tithes and fast offerings. It has been estimated that during the 2010s its net worth increased by about $15 billion per year ($18.5 billion in 2022[144]),[143] and by $22 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic.[202] According to a 2020 estimate by The Wall Street Journal, the LDS Church's investment fund had a net worth of around $100 billion.[203][204] The church's assets are held in a variety of holding companies, subsidiary corporations, and for-profit companies including: Bonneville International, KSL, Deseret Book Company, and holding companies for cattle ranches and farms in at least 12 U.S. States, Canada, New Zealand, and Argentina. Also included are banks and insurance companies, hotels and restaurants, real estate development, forestry and mining operations, and transportation and railway companies.[205][206] Investigative journalism from the Truth & Transparency Foundation in 2022 suggests the church may be the owner of the most valuable real estate portfolio in the United States, with a minimum market value of $15.7 billion.[205] The church has also invested in for-profit business and real estate ventures such as City Creek Center.[206] The Church-owned investment firm Ensign Peak Advisors publicly reports management of $37.8 billion of financial securities, as of 2020.[176] Due to the differences in lifestyle promoted by church doctrine and history, members of the church have developed a distinct culture. It is primarily concentrated in the Intermountain West.[207] Many of the church's more distinctive practices follow from their adherence to the Word of Wisdom—which includes abstinence from tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea—and their observance of Sabbath-day restrictions on recreation and shopping. Common, distinctive cuisine includes funeral potatoes and Jello salad.[208] Cultural taboos exist on piercings[w] and tattoos[137] and the church counsels against the use of crosses as symbols of worship.[209] LDS-themed media includes cinema, fiction, websites, and graphical art such as photography and paintings. The church owns a chain of bookstores called Deseret Book, which provide a channel through which publications are sold; church leaders have authored books and sold them through the publishing arm of the bookstore. BYU TV, the church-sponsored television station, also airs on several networks. The church also produces several pageants annually depicting various events of the primitive and modern-day church. Its Easter pageant Jesus the Christ has been identified as the \"largest annual outdoor Easter pageant in the world\".[210] The church encourages entertainment without violence, sexual content, or vulgar language; many church members specifically avoid rated-R movies.[211] The church's official choir, the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square, was formed in the mid-19th century and performs in the Salt Lake Tabernacle. They have travelled to more than 28 countries,[212] and are considered one of the most famous choirs in the world.[213] The choir has received a Grammy Award, four Emmy Awards,[214] two Peabody Awards,[215] and the National Medal of Arts.[216] The LDS Church states it generally takes no partisan role in politics,[217] but encourages its members to play an active role as responsible citizens in their communities, including becoming informed about issues and voting.[218] The church maintains that the faith's values can be found among many political parties.[218][217] A 2012 Pew Center on Religion and Public Life survey indicates that 74 percent of U.S. members lean towards the Republican Party.[219] Some liberal members say they feel that they have to defend their worthiness due to political differences.[220] Democrats and those who lean Democrat made up 18% of church members surveyed in the 2014 Pew Research Center's Religious Landscape Survey.[221][222] The official church stance on staying out of politics does not include if there are instances of what church leaders deem to be moral issues, or issues the church believes \"directly affect [its] mission, teachings or operations.\"[217] It has previously opposed same-sex marriage in California Prop 8,[223] supported a gay rights bill in Salt Lake City which bans discrimination against homosexual persons in housing and employment,[224][225] opposed gambling,[59] opposed storage of nuclear waste in Utah,[226] and supported an approach to U.S. immigration policy as outlined in the Utah Compact.[227] It also opposed a ballot initiative legalizing medicinal marijuana in Utah,[228] but supported a possible alternative to it.[229] In 2019 and 2021, the church stated its opposition to the Equality Act, which would prohibit discrimination in the United States on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, but supports alternate legislation that it says would protect both LGBTQ rights and religious freedom.[230] In 2022, the church stated its support for the Respect for Marriage Act—which codified same-sex marriage as legal in the United States—due to the \"protections for religious freedom\" it includes.[231] In the 117th United States Congress, there are nine LDS Church members, including all six members of Utah's congressional delegation, all of whom are Republicans.[232] Utah's current governor, Spencer Cox, is also a church member,[233] as are supermajorities in both houses of the Utah State Legislature.[234] Church member and current U.S. Senator Mitt Romney was the Republican Party's nominee in the U.S. 2012 presidential election.[235] The church reports a worldwide membership of 17 million.[3][237] The church's definition of \"membership\" includes all persons who were ever baptized, or whose parents were members while the person was under the age of eight (called \"members of record\"),[238]: 145–146 who have neither been excommunicated nor asked to have their names removed from church records[238]: 116, 148–149 with approximately 8.3 million residing outside the United States, as of December 2011.[x][237] According to its statistics, the church is the fourth largest religious body in the United States.[241][242] Although the church does not publish attendance figures, researchers estimate that attendance at weekly LDS worship services globally is around 4 million.[243] Members living in the U.S. and Canada constitute 46 percent of membership, Latin America 38 percent, and members in the rest of the world 16 percent.[237] The 2012 Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life survey, conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, found that approximately 2 percent of the U.S. adult population self-identified as Mormon.[236] Membership is concentrated geographically in the Intermountain West, in a specific region sometimes known as the Mormon corridor.[244] Church members and some others from the United States colonized this region in the mid-to-late 1800s, dispossessing several indigenous tribes in the process.[46]: 28, 249–250, 365 [47] The church experienced rapid numerical growth in the 20th century, especially in the 1980s and 1990s.[245]: 1 In the 21st century, however, church membership growth has slowed.[246][247] In 2022, eight of the top ten nations with the highest LDS membership growth rate were in Africa,[248] and Latino people are one of the fastest growing ethnic groups with millions of LDS adherents in Latin American countries.[249] In the United States, church members tend to be more highly educated than the general population.[250] The racial and ethnic composition of membership in the United States is one of the least diverse in the country. Church membership is predominantly white;[251] the membership of blacks is significantly lower than the general U.S. population.[239] The LDS Church does not release official statistics on church activity, but it is likely that only approximately 40 percent of its recorded membership in the United States and 30 percent worldwide regularly attend weekly Sunday worship services.[252][y] A 2016 survey found a majority (54%) of millennials raised in the church had disaffiliated.[254] Activity rates vary with age, and disengagement occurs most frequently between age 16 and 25. Young single adults are more likely to become inactive than their married counterparts,[255] and women tend to be more active than men.[100]: 55 The LDS Church provides worldwide humanitarian service,[256][257] and is considered widely known for it.[194] The church's welfare and humanitarian efforts are coordinated by Philanthropies, a church department under the direction of the Presiding Bishopric.[194] Welfare efforts, originally initiated during the Great Depression, provide aid for the poor, financed by donations from church members. Philanthropies is also responsible for philanthropic (that is, not tithing or fast offering) donations to the LDS Church and other affiliated charities, such as the Church History Library, the Church Educational System (and its subsidiary organizations), the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square and funds for LDS missionaries.[258][259] Donations are also used to operate bishop's storehouses, which package and store food for lower-income people at low cost, and provide other local services.[260] In 2016, the church reported that it had spent a total of $1.2 billion on humanitarian aid over the previous 30 years.[194] Church humanitarian aid includes organizing food security, clean water, mobility, and healthcare initiatives, operating thrift stores, maintaining a service project website, and directly funding or partnering with other organizations. The church reports that the value of all charitable donations in 2021 was $906 million.[13] Independent reporting has found that the Church's charity organization, LDS Charities, gave a total of $177 million from 2008 to 2020.[261] The church also distributes money and aid to disaster victims worldwide.[262] In 2017, the church partnered with Catholic Relief Services and other organizations to provide aid to several African and Middle Eastern nations.[63] In 2010, it partnered with Islamic Relief to help victims of flooding in Pakistan.[263] Latter-day Saint Charities (a branch of the church's welfare department) increased food production during the COVID-19 pandemic and donated healthcare supplies to 16 countries affected by the crisis.[264][265][266] The church has donated $4 million to aid refugees fleeing from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[267] In 2022, the church gave $32 million to the United Nations World Food Programme, in its largest one-time donation to a humanitarian organization to that point.[268] The LDS Church and other churches within Mormonism have been the subject of discrimination and sometimes violent persecution. The most vocal and strident opposition occurred during the 19th century, particularly the forceful expulsion from Missouri and Illinois in the 1830s and 1840s, during the Utah War of the 1850s, and in the second half of the century.[269] Violent persecution against the LDS Church occurred in the early 1830s in Missouri. Mormons quickly earned long-lasting enmity in the frontier communities, due to discordant cultural attitudes (including opposition to slavery in a slave state) and their practice of voting as a bloc (thus gaining significant political power).[270] This enmity culminated in the Missouri Mormon War and Governor Boggs' \"extermination order.\" The LDS Church has been subject to criticism and the subject of controversy since its early years in New York and Pennsylvania. Modern criticism of the church includes disputed claims, allegations of historical revisionism by the church,[271] child sexual abuse, anti-gay teachings,[60]: 4, 288–301 [272] racism,[273][274][275] and sexism.[276][277] Notable 20th-century critics include Jerald and Sandra Tanner[278] and historian Fawn Brodie.[279] The church has been criticized for a number of alleged abuses perpetrated by local church leadership. In other cases, church leaders have been criticized for allegedly failing to properly report abuse to law enforcement.[280] In the late 1820s, criticism centered on the claim by Joseph Smith to have been led to a set of gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.[15]: 116–118 [26]: 80–82, 87 Mainstream archaeological, historical, and scientific communities have discovered little to support the existence of the civilizations described in the Book of Mormon, and do not consider it to be an actual record of historical events.[281] Scholars have pointed out a number of anachronisms within the text. They argue that no evidence of a reformed Egyptian language has ever been discovered.[282]: 91 [z] Also, general archaeological and genetic evidence has not supported the book's statements about any known indigenous peoples of the Americas.[284][285] Since its publication in 1842, the Book of Abraham (currently published as part of the canonical Pearl of Great Price) has also been a major source of controversy. Numerous non-Mormon Egyptologists, beginning in the late 19th century,[286]: 61 have disagreed with Joseph Smith's explanations of the book's facsimiles. Translations of the original papyri—by both Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists—do not match the text of the Book of Abraham as purportedly translated by Joseph Smith.[287]: 61 Indeed, the transliterated text from the recovered papyri and facsimiles published in the Book of Abraham contain no direct references to Abraham.[288]: 269 [289][286]: 66 Scholars have also asserted that damaged portions of the papyri were reconstructed incorrectly by Smith or his associates.[287]: 25 Polygamy (called plural marriage within the church) was practiced by church leaders for more than half of the 19th century,[290] and practiced publicly from 1852 to 1890 by between 20 and 30 percent of Latter-day Saint families.[291][53] It was instituted privately in the 1830s by founder Joseph Smith and announced publicly in 1852 at the direction of Brigham Young.[53] For over 60 years, the church and the United States were at odds over the issue: at one point, the Republican platform referenced \"the twin relics of barbarism—polygamy and slavery.\"[292] The church defended the practice as a matter of religious freedom, while the federal government aggressively sought to eradicate it; in 1862, the United States Congress passed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, which prohibited plural marriage in the territories.[53] In 1890, church president Wilford Woodruff issued a Manifesto that officially terminated the practice in the United States,[52] though it did not dissolve existing polygamous marriages of any couples, some of which continued to cohabit into the 1950s.[290] Some church members continued to enter into polygamous marriages in Canada and Mexico, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president Joseph F. Smith disavowed polygamy before Congress and issued a \"Second Manifesto,\" calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease. Several small fundamentalist groups, seeking to continue the practice, split from the LDS Church, but the mainline church now excommunicates members found practicing polygamy and distances itself from those fundamentalist groups.[100]: 91 [293] The teachings, attitudes, and practices of top LDS Church leaders towards Black people have changed significantly from its founding years to the modern times, and the church has faced criticism and controversy on these topics.[295]: 1–5 [296]: 5–7 [297] Church founder Smith allowed for several black men to be ordained as priests during his presidency but he also taught that the dark skin of people of Black African ancestry was a sign of their curse from God,[298]: 213 [299]: 27 and both he and Young taught that Black people were subject to the Biblical curse of Ham,[300]: 126 [301] and curse of Cain.[299][300]: 256 They also both made statements in support of Black enslavement,[295]: 22 and Young legalized Black slavery while acting as Utah territory's governor.[302][303]: 69 [304]: 34 From 1844 to 1978, the church barred Black women and men from participating in temple ordinances necessary for the highest level of salvation;[305][306][307] prevented most men of Black African descent from being ordained to the church's lay, all-male priesthood;[308]: 64 supported racial segregation in its communities and schools;[295]: 67, 78 [309] taught that righteous Black people would be made White after death;[273][310][311]: 148 and opposed interracial marriage.[312][62]: 89 Leaders taught on many occasions during this time that Black people were less righteous in the pre-existence.[313]: 27 [295]: 56, 66 [62]: 221 The temple and priesthood racial restrictions were lifted by top leaders in 1978;[295]: 106–107 [314] public pressure during the United States' civil rights movement had preceded the priesthood ban being rescinded.[aa] In 2013 the church directly disavowed its previous teachings on race for the first time.[273][317] In 2018, the Church formed an alliance with the NAACP in an effort to improve race relations.[318] Over the past two centuries, the relationship between Native American people and the LDS Church has included friendly ties, displacement, battles, slavery, education placement programs, official and unofficial discrimination, and criticism.[319][320] Church leadership and publications taught that Native Americans are descendants of Lamanites, a dark-skinned and cursed people from the Book of Mormon.[321]: 196 [320] More recently, LDS researchers and publications generally favor a smaller geographic footprint of Lamanite descendants.[ab][323] There is no direct support amongst mainstream historians and archaeologists for the historicity of the Book of Mormon or Middle Eastern origins for any Native American peoples.[324][21][22]: 259–267 Soon after Mormons colonized the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, Native American child slaves became a vital source of their labor, and were exchanged as gifts.[325][326]: 273–274 The settlers initially had some peaceful relations, but because resources were scarce in the desert, hostilities broke out with the local Native Americans.[327] According to LDS Church Historian Marlin K. Jensen as more LDS immigrants arrived and took over the land of Native nations, \"Resources the Indians had relied on for generations diminished, and in time they felt forced to resist and fight for their own survival ... the land and cultural birthright Indians once possessed in the Great Basin were largely taken from them.\"[327] Within 50 years of Mormon settlement, the population of Utah's Native Americans was reduced by almost 90%.[326]: 273 The church ran an Indian Placement Program between the 1950s and the 1990s, wherein indigenous children were adopted by white church members. Criticism resulted during and after the program, including claims of improper assimilation and even abuse.[328][273] However, many of the involved students and families praised the program.[329]: 194–195 Church leaders taught for decades that Native Americans' darker skin would be made lighter due to their righteousness.[330][309][298]: 64 The church's policies and treatment of sexual minorities and gender minorities have long been the subject of external criticism,[331][332][333] as well as internal controversy and disaffection by members.[334][335][336] Because of its ban against same-sex sexual activity and same-sex marriage, the LDS church taught for decades that any adherents attracted to the same sex could and should change that through sexual orientation change efforts and righteous striving.[60]: 25–30, 89–101 The church provided therapy and programs for attempting to change sexual orientation.[337] Current teachings and policies leave homosexual members with the options of: potentially harmful attempts to change their sexual orientation, entering a mixed-orientation opposite-sex marriage, or lifelong celibacy.[338][339][340]: 20–21 Some have argued that church teachings against homosexuality and the treatment of LGBT members by other adherents and leaders have contributing to their elevated rates of PTSD and depression,[341][342][343] as well as suicide and teen homelessness.[60]: 4, 288–301 [344][345] The church's decades-long, political involvement opposing US same-sex marriage laws has further garnered criticism and protests.[60]: 2–3, 162–163 [346] In the 1830s, the church was heavily criticized for Smith's handling of a banking failure in Kirtland, Ohio.[26]: 195–196 [15]: 328, 330, 334 After the Mormons migrated west, there was fear and suspicion about the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri,[ac] culminating in the 1838 Mormon War and the Mormon Extermination Order (Missouri Executive Order 44) by Governor Lilburn Boggs. In the 1840s, criticism of the church included its theocratic aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois. Criticism of the practice of plural marriage and other doctrines taught by Smith were published in the Nauvoo Expositor.[15]: 539 [ad] Opposition led to a series of events culminating in the killing of Smith and his brother while jailed in 1844.[347] The church's failure to make its finances public has drawn criticism from commentators who consider its practices too secretive.[348][349][282]: 516–528 [350] In December 2019, a whistleblower alleged the church held over $100 billion in investment funds through its investment management company, Ensign Peak Advisors (EP); that it failed to use the funds for charitable purposes and instead used them in for-profit ventures; and that it misled contributors and the public about the usage and extent of those funds.[351][352] In response, the church's First Presidency stated that \"the Church complies with all applicable law governing our donations, investments, taxes, and reserves,\" and that \"a portion\" of funds received by the church are \"methodically safeguarded through wise financial management and the building of a prudent reserve for the future\".[353] The church has not directly addressed the fund's size to the public, but third parties have treated the disclosures as legitimate.[203][204] The disclosure of Ensign Peak has led to criticism that the church's wealth may be excessive.[354] The church has been accused of \"significant tax evasion\" in Australia. According to an investigation by Australian newspapers, The Daily Age and The Sun Herald, the church's corporation LDS Charities Australia was the recipient of nearly $70 million in donations annually (which is tax exempt under Australian law, as opposed to religious donations, which are not) but appeared to actually spend very little of it on charity. According to the investigation, tithing and other religious donations were routed through the corporation to ensure they would be tax exempt. The investigation does not reference any internal church documents to confirm their findings.[355][356] The church has previously fought to keep its internal financial information out of the public record.[357][358] In July 2023, the Sydney Morning Herald reported the church \"has moved to unwind the tax structure\" at issue.[359] In Canada, a total of more than 1 billion dollars collected through tithing has been transferred tax-free to church universities over a 15-year period.[360] In October 2022, The Sydney Morning Herald announced the results of an investigation it conducted together with multiple other media organizations—that while the church publicly claimed to have donated US$1.35 billion to charity between 2008 and 2020, its private financial reports showed that it actually donated only US$0.177 billion to charity in that period.[361][ae] In February 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a $5 million penalty to the church and its investment company, EP. The SEC alleged that the church concealed its investments and their management in multiple shell companies from 1997 to 2019; the SEC believes these shell companies were approved by senior church leadership to avoid public transparency.[358] The church released a statement that in 2000 EP \"received and relied upon legal counsel regarding how to comply with its reporting obligations while attempting to maintain the privacy of the portfolio.\" After initial SEC concern in June 2019, the church stated that EP \"adjusted its approach and began filing a single aggregated report.\"[363] Mormon apologetics organizations, such as FAIR and the Maxwell Institute, seek to counter criticisms of the church and its leaders. Most of the apologetic work focuses on providing and discussing evidence supporting the claims of Smith and the Book of Mormon. Scholars and authors such as Hugh Nibley,[364] Daniel C. Peterson,[365] and others are well-known apologists within the church. The Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) was a well-known apologetic organization before being absorbed into the Maxwell Institute in 2006.", "Ref A: 598E7DA7747C4FB3957D32B613713E6E Ref B: BJ1EDGE0906 Ref C: 2023-11-15T14:34:37Z", "See what’s changed on the home page of ChurchofJesusChrist.org. Yes! As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of the World. He loves us all more than we can imagine. We consider ourselves devoted followers of Jesus. While some of our beliefs are distinct, we believe that through His life, ministry, sacrifice, and resurrection, Jesus Christ saves us from sin, suffering, and death.Learn more about our beliefs. Church service times vary from congregation to congregation. However, you can always count on one main worship service for everyone, followed by classes for children, youth, and adults.The service for everyone is called “sacrament meeting.” This meeting consists of songs, prayers, and sermons (or “talks”) given by different members of the congregation every week. But the most important part of the meeting is when we take the sacrament (which is similar to communion) to remember the Savior.Learn more about Sunday services or find a church near you. For Latter-day Saints, a temple is different from other Church buildings. The temple is a place where Latter-day Saints receive special instruction about God and Jesus Christ. In the temple, members make eternal covenants (or promises) with God. This includes promises to keep the commandments, live the gospel of Jesus Christ, be faithful in marriage, and to help take care of each other by sharing what we have.

In the movie, Bridget, who is portrayed by Renée Zellweger, is faced with uncertainty about who the father of her child is, leading to humorous and heartwarming situations as the story unfolds. The film is a romantic comedy and the third installment in the Bridget Jones series.", "token_usage": 108, "human_written_evidences": [], "reference_documents": [], "model_retrieved_documents": ["Entertainment Whether you obsessed over the original movies when they were released in the early 2000s or you're just hopping on-board the Bridget train now, chances are that you're pretty excited for Bridget Jones' Baby, the long-awaited third movie in the franchise. Out Sept. 16, the film is a welcome return to the series, with Renee Zellweger reprising her beloved character and, like usual, two men — Colin Firth and Patrick Dempsey — vying for her affection. Although in this case, there's a twist not seen in the earlier films: Bridget is pregnant, and, as the movie's poster and trailers have made clear, she's not quite sure who the father is. If you, too, are dying to know who's the father of Bridget Jones' baby, I've got you covered — but beware, major Bridget Jones' Baby spoilers ahead. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you might want to wait until you do before reading You ready to know all the secrets about Bridget Jones' Baby? OK, here goes: the guy who impregnates Bridget is.... Mr. Darcy! Yes, Firth's much-adored character is the father of Bridget's baby, and at the movie's end, he's seen happily raising the boy (who looks just like him) alongside Bridget. Fans of the adorably stuffy British lawyer might be breathing sighs of relief right now as, after all, many people are convinced (rightfully, in my humble opinion) that he's Bridget's one true love. And the movie seems to share this view, ending with a scene of Bridget and Mark's wedding, in which their one-year-old son is in attendance. (If you're hysterically crying by this juncture, trust me, you're not the only one.) But of course, nothing's that simple in the world of Bridget Jones. Although Mark Darcy does turn out to be the father of Bridget's child, the other possibility, Dempsey's Jack Qwant, is shown at the movie's end to still be a major figure in Bridget and the baby's lives, which makes sense considering how involved he was during her pregnancy and how much he's seen to care for Bridget. Qwant attends the wedding and holds the baby, William, at the altar; in a scene right afterwards, he plays with the child until Mark jokingly asks him to give the baby back. At the end of the movie, it appears that the three adults are in a truly good place with one another, despite all the confusion and anguish they experienced by not knowing which of the men had fathered Bridget's child. Personally, I was thrilled to find out that Mark was the father, as I've always rooted for his relationship with Bridget (sorry, Daniel Cleaver). Still, how great would it have been to see a baby with McDreamy's hair? Sigh...

Washington's leadership and dedication to the cause of American independence were instrumental in the success of the revolution.", "token_usage": 90, "human_written_evidences": [], "reference_documents": [], "model_retrieved_documents": ["The American Revolution was a revolt in the Thirteen British Colonies in North America which lasted from 1765 to 1783. After conflict between Great Britain and its colonies on several issues, most prominently taxation without representation; the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775. During the war, the Continental Army defeated the British leading to the formation of the United States of America. There were several influential leaders during the course of the American Revolution. Samuel Adams was a key figure in the early phase of the revolution who forcefully opposed taxation and organized protests. Once war broke out, George Washington led the Continental Army and he was supported by many able officers including Nathanael Greene. On the British side, Frederick North was the prime minister during most of the revolution. The post of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in America was held by four people during the war. The most prominent among these were William Howe and Henry Clinton. Together these two led the British troops through most of the revolutionary war. Here are the 10 major military and political leaders of the American Revolution. Frederick North, better known as Lord North, was the Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1770 to 1782. It was the Parliament which held true power in Great Britain and thus Lord North led his nation through most of the American Revolution. The American colonies were dissatisfied about taxation without representation, that is being taxed by a British Parliament to which they elected no representatives. This conflict led to the Boston Tea Party in 1773, an event in which Bostonians dumped 342 chests of tea, worth £10,000, into into the Boston Harbor. Lord North responded to this by implementing a number of legislative measures to punish the Bostonians. He thought that this would dispirit the rebellious colonists but instead it led to open war between the two sides with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775. After France joined the conflict on the side of the Americans in 1778, the conflict escalated to other regions, compounding troubles for Lord North. He saw little benefit in continuing the conflict and attempted to resign, but King George III rejected both his proposals. However, the decisive victory of the Americans at Yorktown ultimately forced the king to accept North’s resignation in 1782 as well as to end offensive operations in America. Born in Boston, Samuel Adams was elected to the Massachusetts assembly in 1764. The British Parliament passed the Stamp Act the following year imposing direct taxes on the colonies for the first time. Samuel Adams denounced the Act and was one of the first to oppose taxation without representation. Moreover, through his writing, he urged fellow Bostonians to resist what he termed were illegal actions of the British Parliament. In May 1773, the British Parliament passed the Tea Act, which allowed East India Company to sell tea in American colonies without paying taxes. By then, Adams had assumed leadership of the Massachusetts radicals and it was he who, more than anyone else, planned the Boston Tea Party in 1773. When the Revolutionary War began, Adams played a leading role in the Continental Congress and pushed for complete independence. Samuel Adams was a key figure in the early phase of the American Revolution. He was a master at organizing protests and he also spread the cause of the revolution through his writings. After the United States achieved independence, Adams went on to serve as Governor of Massachusetts from 1794 to 1797. When the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775, Congress created the Continental Army and George Washington was appointed as its Commander-In-Chief. Washington took enormous duties during the war. He plotted the overall strategy of the war along with the Congress. He organized and trained the army and maintained their morale. Most importantly his stature as well as his political and personal skill was instrumental to make the Congress, the army, the French and the states work towards a common goal. Washington actively led his men against the main British forces in 1775 – 77 and then again in 1781. Though he lost battles he never surrendered his army during the war. When the British had handed the Americans a number of major defeats and most had thought that the cause was lost, it was Washington who laid out a bold plan, crossed the ice choked Delaware River and handed the British a defeat at the Battle of Trenton. Victory at Trenton greatly boosted the morale in the colonies and led to new recruits joining the forces. Moreover, he also led the American force that defeated a British army commanded by Lord Cornwallis at the decisive Battle of Yorktown. After the Revolutionary War, Washington went on to serve as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. In September 1775, William Howe took over as Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in America. The American Revolutionary War had just begun then and Boston was under siege. Howe planned to establish base in New York and Newport, Rhode Island in an attempt to isolate the rebellion to New England. The British forces thus evacuated Boston on March 17, 1776. On August 22, a British force under Howe landed on the south beaches of Long Island. What followed was a series of victories for the British which drove the Continental Army completely out of New York and to retreat through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania. Howe then embarked on a campaign toward Philadelphia, then the American capital. He defeated the Americans at the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777. This left Philadelphia vulnerable. Howe captured the American capital two weeks later on September 26. However, his taking of Philadelphia contributed to the failure of General John Burgoyne’s Saratoga campaign. The Battles of Saratoga were a disaster for the British as Burgoyne had to surrender his entire army on October 17. More importantly, the comprehensive victory gave France the confidence that America could win the war and this resulted in the formal Franco-American alliance. Howe submitted his recognition in October 1777 and it was accepted in April 1778. First arriving in Boston in May 1775, Henry Clinton had served as the second in command to Howe. He replaced Howe as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in America in May 1778. The Northern strategy of the British had failed due to the Battles of Saratoga and, after taking command, Clinton evacuated their troops from Philadelphia back to New York City in 1778 to strengthen the city’s defense against a possible Franco-American attack. Clinton then conducted the successful Siege of Charleston from March 29, 1780 to May 12, 1780. The American losses after the siege were 89 killed, 138 wounded and 5,466 captured. The Siege of Charleston was one of the worst American defeats of the war. After capturing Charleston, the British drove the remaining Continental Army troops from South Carolina by May 29, thus strengthening their hold in the South. After capturing Charleston, Henry Clinton returned to New York, leaving the command in the south to Lord Charles Cornwallis. Miscommunication and disagreement between Clinton and both Cornwallis and Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot contributed to British failures that culminated in the 1781 Siege of Yorktown. The siege, which lasted for 20 days, resulted in Cornwallis surrendering his entire force of more than 7,000. It was the last major battle of the American Revolutionary War as it forced the British to negotiate an end to the conflict. In 1782, after fighting in the North American theater also ended due to Yorktown, Clinton was replaced as Commander-in-Chief by Guy Carleton. Comte de Rochambeau was the Commander-In-Chief of the French Expeditionary Force that embarked from France in order to help the American Continental Army fight against British forces. Though he arrived in 1779, he was largely inactive for a year due to the successful British blockading of Rhode Island’s ports. On July 6, 1781 the French and American armies met near New York City. Although Rochambeau had almost 40 years of warfare experience, he told Washington that he had come to serve and not to command and he never challenged Washington’s authority. Washington and Rochambeau then marched their combined forces to the Siege of Yorktown. There their troops met with the troops of Marquis de Lafayette to conduct the successful siege. It resulted in the surrender of the entire army of Lord Charles Cornwallis and was the decisive battle of the American Revolutionary War. After the siege, Rochambeau remained to garrison the southern states until 1783. Upon his return to France, Rochambeau was honored by King Louis XVI and was made governor of the province of Picardy. With the aim of winning glory as a soldier, Lafayette, traveled at his own expense to the American colonies. With no combat experience and not yet 20 years old, he arrived in Philadelphia in July 1777. On August 5, 1777, he met General George Washington and the two would go on to establish a father-son relationship. The first battle he participated in was the Battle of Brandywine, during which he was wounded but still managed to organize an orderly retreat. As he fought with distinction during the battle, he was given command of his own division. He went on to fight in a number of battles including at Barren Hill, Monmouth and Rhode Island. At Barren Hill, despite being massively outnumbered, he conducted a masterly retreat on May 28, 1778. In 1799, Lafayette left for home to lobby for an increase in French support. The following year, he returned to America and was given senior positions in the Continental Army. He went on to serve with distinction in several more battles. However, his most important contribution came in 1781, when troops under his command in Virginia trapped Cornwallis until other American and French forces could position themselves for the decisive Siege of Yorktown. After returning to his homeland, Marquis de Lafayette went on to play an important role in the French Revolution including help write the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Charles Cornwallis began service in North America in 1776 under Henry Clinton in the failed Siege of Charleston. He then participated in the successful New York and New Jersey campaign under Commander-In-Chief William Howe. Cornwallis then continued to serve under Howe as the British took control of Philadelphia. He played a leading role in several battles of the campaign including the Battle of Brandywine and the Battle of Germantown. After Henry Clinton became Commander-In-Chief, Cornwallis became his second in command. Along with Clinton, he led the British forces in the successful second siege of Charleston in 1780. After the siege, Clinton left for New York leaving Cornwallis in command of the south. Post Charleston, Cornwallis began to advance to North Carolina but, after the decisive defeat at the Battle of Kings Mountain, he was forced to retreat back into South Carolina. The Americans reconquered South Carolina from the British. Conrwallis was then trapped at Virginia with the French fleet defeating the Royal Fleet at the Battle of the Chesapeake. After non-stop bombardment from Franco-American forces, no hope of reinforcements and inadequate supplies of artillery ammunition and food, Cornwallis showed the white flag on October 17, 1781. The unpleasant relationship between Cornwallis and Clinton has been cited as a major cause of the British defeat. After the Revolutionary War was over, Charles Cornwallis went on to serve as Governor-General and commander-in-chief in India. After the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775, the legislature of Rhode Island established an army and appointed Nathanael Greene to command it. The same year, he became a general in the newly-established Continental Army. Greene served with distinction under General Washington in the Boston; New York and New Jersey; and the Philadelphia campaigns. In October 1780, after the Americans had suffered a series of devastating defeats in the South under the command of Benjamin Lincoln and Horatio Gates; Nathanael Greene was appointed as the commander of the Continental Army in the southern theater. After taking command, Greene employed guerrilla warfare tactics successfully against the numerically superior British forces led by Charles Cornwallis. He inflicted heavy losses on the British at battles of Guilford Court House; Hobkirk’s Hill; and Eutaw Springs. He was thus instrumental in the in the success of the Continental Army in the southern theater. After the decisive Siege of Yorktown, Greene continued to serve in the Continental Army until late 1783. Nathanael Greene emerged from the war as the most gifted and dependable officer under George Washington. Among other things, he is widely regarded as one of the best strategists in the Continental Army. When the Revolutionary War began, Benjamin Franklin was unanimously elected by the Pennsylvania Assembly as their delegate to the Second Continental Congress, which was a convention of representatives from the Thirteen Colonies to manage their war efforts against Britain. It decided to issue a declaration of independence and Franklin was one of the five members who were appointed to draft it. Though much of it is written by Thomas Jefferson, Franklin made several important changes. The U.S. Declaration of Independence, announcing that the colonies regarded themselves as independent sovereign states, was adopted on July 4, 1776. In December 1776, Franklin was sent to France as the first U.S. Ambassador. He was much admired in France; and played a prominent role in the development of positive relations between America and France. He negotiated a permanent military alliance with France in early 1778. French assistance was instrumental in the victory of the American colonies over Great Britain. The efforts of Benjamin Franklin thus proved vital in the American Revolution. Franklin was also one of the representatives from U.S. who signed the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which, among other things, brought the war to an end and made Britain acknowledge U.S. colonies as free, sovereign and independent states. In independent America, Franklin served as the sixth Governor of Pennsylvania from 1785 to 1788.

The term often explains efforts to reinforce its national identity and self-determination within its national and international affairs.[3] All four forms of nationalism have found expression throughout the United States' history, depending on the historical period. The first Naturalization Act of 1790 passed by Congress and President George Washington defined American identity and citizenship on racial lines, declaring that only \"free white men of good character\" could become citizens, and denying citizenship to enslaved black people and anyone of non-European stock; thus it was a form of ethnic nationalism. American scholars such as Hans Kohn, however, argue that the United States government institutionalized a civic nationalism founded upon legal and rational concepts of citizenship, being based on common language and cultural traditions,[2] and that the Founding Fathers of the United States established the country upon liberal and individualist principles. The United States traces its origins to the Thirteen Colonies founded by Britain in the 17th and early 18th century. Residents identified with Britain until the mid-18th century when the first sense of being \"American\" emerged. The Albany Plan proposed a union between the colonies in 1754. Although unsuccessful, it served as a reference for future discussions of independence. Soon afterward, the colonies faced several common grievances over acts passed by the British Parliament, including taxation without representation. Americans were in general agreement that only their own colonial legislatures—and not Parliament in London—could pass internal taxes. Parliament vigorously insisted otherwise and no compromise was found. The London government punished Boston for the Boston Tea Party, and the Thirteen Colonies united and formed the Continental Congress, which lasted from 1774 to 1789. Fighting broke out in 1775 and the sentiment swung to independence in early 1776, influenced significantly by the appeal to American nationalism by Thomas Paine. His pamphlet Common Sense was a runaway best seller in 1776, read aloud in taverns and coffee houses.[5] Congress unanimously issued a Declaration of Independence announcing a new nation of independent states had formed, the United States of America. American Patriots won the American Revolutionary War and received generous peace terms from Britain in 1783. The minority of Loyalists (loyal to King George III) could remain or leave, but about 80% remained and became full American citizens.[6] Frequent parades along with new rituals and ceremonies—and a new flag—provided popular occasions for expressing a spirit of American nationalism.[7] The new nation operated under the very weak national government set up by the Articles of Confederation, and most Americans prioritized their state over the nation. Nationalists led by George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison had Congress call a constitutional convention in 1787. It produced the Constitution for a strong national government which was debated in every state and unanimously adopted. It went into effect in 1789 as the first modern constitutional liberal democracy based on the consent of the governed,[8][9][10] with Washington as the first President.[11] In an 1858 speech, future President Abraham Lincoln alluded to a form of American civic nationalism originating from the tenets of the Declaration of Independence as a force for national unity in the United States, stating that it was a method for uniting diverse peoples of different ethnic ancestries into a common nationality: If they look back through this history to trace their connection with those days by blood, they find they have none, they cannot carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us, but when they look through that old Declaration of Independence they find that those old men say that \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal\", and then they feel that moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men, that it is the father of all moral principle in them, and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote the Declaration, and so they are. That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world. White Southerners increasingly felt alienated—they saw themselves as becoming second-class citizens as aggressive anti-slavery Northerners tried to end their ability to enslave people to the fast-growing western territories. They questioned whether their loyalty to the nation trumped their commitment to their state and their way of life since it was so intimately bound up with slavery and whether they could enslave people.[13] A sense of Southern nationalism was starting to emerge; however, it was rudimentary as late as 1860 when the election of Lincoln was a signal for most of the slave states in the South to secede and form a new nation.[14] The Confederate government insisted the nationalism was real and imposed increasing burdens on the population in the name of independence and nationalism. The fierce combat record of the Confederates demonstrates their commitment to the death for independence. The government and army refused to compromise and were militarily overwhelmed in 1865.[15] By the 1890s, the white South felt vindicated through its belief in the newly constructed memory of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. The North came to accept or at least tolerate racial segregation and disfranchisement of black voters in the South. The spirit of American nationalism had returned to Dixie.[16] The North's triumph in the American Civil War marked a significant transition in American national identity. The ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment settled the fundamental question of national identity, such as the criteria for becoming a citizen of the United States. Everyone born in the territorial boundaries of the United States or those areas and subject to its jurisdiction was an American citizen, regardless of ethnicity or social status (indigenous people on reservations became citizens in 1924, while indigenous people off reservations had always been citizens).[19] With a fast-growing industrial economy, immigrants were welcome from Europe, Canada, Mexico, and Cuba, and millions came. Becoming a full citizen was easy, requiring the completion of paperwork over five years.[20] However, new Asian arrivals were not welcome. The U.S. imposed restrictions on most Chinese immigrants in the 1880s and informal restrictions on most Japanese in 1907. By 1924, it was difficult for any Asian to enter the United States, but children born in the United States to Asian parents were full citizens. The restrictions were ended on the Chinese in the 1940s and on other Asians in 1965.[21] After the United States entered World War I, nationalism surged. Americans enlisted in the military en masse, motivated by propaganda and war films.[22] There was very little resistance to conscription.[23] World War II led to unprecedented nationalism in the United States. After the 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor, many Americans enlisted in the military.[24][25] During the war, much of American life centered on contributing to the war effort, mainly through volunteer efforts, entry into the labor force, rationing, price controls, and income saving. Citizens willingly accepted these sacrifices out of a sense of nationalism, feeling they were for the greater good.[26][27] Even members of anti-war groups like the pacifist churches, anti-war movement, and conscientious objectors abandoned their pacifism for the sake of the war, feeling that World War II was a just war.[28][29][24] Following World War II and beginning with the Cold War, the United States emerged as a world superpower and abandoned its traditional policy of isolationism in favor of interventionism. With this, nationalism took on a new form in the U.S., as Americans began to view their country as a world police with the ultimate goal of eradicating communism from the world. This nationalist fervor was fueled by US involvement in the Korean War, Vietnam War, Bay of Pigs Invasion, and many other conflicts.[30][31] The September 11 attacks of 2001 led to a wave of nationalist expression in the United States. The start of the war on terror was accompanied by a rise in military enlistment that included not only lower-income Americans but also middle-class and upper-class citizens.[32] This nationalism continued long into the War in Afghanistan and Iraq War.[33] Nationalism and Americanism remain topics in the modern United States. Political scientist Paul McCartney, for instance, argues that as a nation defined by a creed and sense of mission, Americans tend to equate their interests with those of humanity, which informs their global posture.[34] In some instances, it may be considered a form of ethnocentrism and American exceptionalism. Due to the distinctive circumstances involved throughout history in American politics, its nationalism has developed concerning loyalty to a set of liberal, universal political ideals and perceived accountability to propagate those principles globally. Acknowledging the conception of the United States as accountable for spreading liberal change and promoting democracy throughout the world's politics and governance has defined practically all of American foreign policy. Therefore, democracy promotion is not just another measure of foreign policy, but it is instead the fundamental characteristic of their national identity and political determination.[35] In a 2016 paper in the American Sociological Review, \"Varieties of American Popular Nationalism\", sociologists Bart Bonikowski and Paul DiMaggio report on research findings supporting the existence of at least four kinds of American nationalists, including, groups which range from the smallest to the largest: (1) the disengaged, (2) creedal or civic nationalists, (3) ardent nationalists, and (4) restrictive nationalists.[36] Bonikowski and Dimaggio's analysis of these four groups found that ardent nationalists made up about 24% of their study, and they comprised the largest of the two groups Bonikowski and Dimaggio consider \"extreme\". Members of this group closely identified with the United States, were very proud of their country and strongly associated themselves with factors of national hubris. They felt that a \"true American\" must speak English and live in the U.S. for most of their life. Fewer, but 75%, believe that a \"true American\" must be a Christian, and 86% believe a \"true American\" must be born in the country. Further, ardent nationalists thought that Jews, Muslims, agnostics and naturalized citizens were something less than genuinely American. The second class, Bonikowski and DiMaggio considered \"extreme\", was the smallest of the four classes because its members comprised 17% of their respondents. The disengaged showed low pride in the government institutions, and they did not fully identify with the United States. Their lack of pride extended to American democracy, American history, political equality in the U.S., and the country's political influence. This group was the least nationalistic of all of the four groups which they identified.[36] The two remaining classes were less homogeneous in their responses than the ardent nationalists and disengaged were. Restrictive nationalists had low levels of pride in America and its institutions, but they defined a \"true American\" in ways that were markedly \"exclusionary\". This group was the largest of the four because its members comprised 38% of the study's respondents. While their levels of national identification and pride were moderate, they espoused beliefs that caused them to hold restrictive definitions of \"true Americans\"; for instance, their definitions excluded non-Christians.\" The final group to be identified was creedal nationalists (also known as civic nationalists), whose members made up 22% of the study's respondents who were studied. This group believed in liberal values, was proud of the United States, and its members held the fewest restrictions on who could be considered a true American. They closely identified with their country, which they felt \"very close\" to, and were proud of its achievements. Bonikowski and Dimaggio dubbed the group \"creedal\" because their beliefs most closely approximated the precepts of what is widely considered the American creed.[36] As part of their findings, the authors report that the connection between big money, religious belief, and national identity is significant. The belief that being a Christian is an integral part of what it means to be a \"true American\" is the most significant factor which separates the creedal nationalists and the disengaged from the restrictive and ardent nationalists. They also determined that their groupings cut across partisan boundaries, and they also help to explain what they perceive is the recent success of populist, nativist, and racist rhetoric in American politics.[36] According to a 2021 American Journal of Sociology study by Bart Bonikowski, Yuval Feinstein, and Sean Bock, competing understandings of American nationhood had emerged in the United States in the prior two decades. They find, \"nationalism has become sorted by party, as Republican identifiers have come to define America in more exclusionary and critical terms and Democrats have increasingly endorsed inclusive and positive conceptions of nationhood.\"[38] Cultural nationalism has historically been an integral element of American nationalism. Such cultural nationalists form group allegiances based on a common cultural heritage rather than race or political party. This heritage may include culture (Culture of the United States), language (English language), religion (Christianity), history (History of the United States), ideology (Democracy), and symbols (National symbols of the United States). Cultural nationalism is distinct from ethnic nationalism, in which race and ethnicity are emphasized over culture and language.[39][40] Nationalism gained a cultural character beginning in the late 18th century. Multiple historical ideas have shaped modern cultural nationalism in the U.S., including the concept of the nation state, the fusion of nationalism and religion into religious nationalism, and identity politics.[40] American nationalism sometimes takes the form of Civic nationalism, a liberal form of nationalism based on values such as freedom, equality, and individual rights. Civic nationalists view nationhood as a political identity. They argue that liberal democratic principles and loyalty define a civic nation. Membership is open to every citizen, regardless of culture, ethnicity, or language, as long as they believe in these values.[41][42] President Donald Trump was described as a nationalist,[43] and he embraced the term himself.[44] Several officials within his administration, including former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon,[45] Senior Advisor to the President Stephen Miller,[45] Director of the National Trade Council Peter Navarro,[46] former Deputy Assistant to the President Sebastian Gorka,[45] Special Assistant to the President Julia Hahn,[47] former Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Communications Michael Anton,[48] Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,[49] Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross,[50] Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer,[51] former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell,[52] former National Security Advisor John R. Bolton[53] and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn[54] were described as representing a \"nationalist wing\" within the federal government.[55] In a February 2017 article in The Atlantic, journalist Uri Friedman described \"populist economic nationalist\" as a new nationalist movement \"modeled on the 'populism' of the 19th-century U.S. President Andrew Jackson\" which was introduced in Trump's remarks to the Republican National Convention in a speech written by Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon. Miller had adopted Senator Jeff Sessions' form of \"nation-state populism\" while working as his aide.[56] By September 2017, The Washington Post journalist Greg Sargent observed that \"Trump's nationalism\" as \"defined\" by Bannon, Breitbart, Miller and \"the rest of the 'populist economic nationalist' contingent around Trump\" was beginning to have wavering support among Trump voters.[57] Some Republican members of Congress were also described as nationalists during the Trump era, such as Representative Steve King,[58] Representative Matt Gaetz,[59] Senator Tom Cotton[60] and Senator Josh Hawley.[61] During the Trump era, commonly identified American nationalist political commentators included Ann Coulter,[62] Michelle Malkin,[63] Lou Dobbs,[64] Alex Jones,[65] Charlie Kirk,[66] Laura Ingraham,[62] Michael Savage,[67] Tucker Carlson,[68] and Mike Cernovich.[69] Notes", "By: History.com Editors Updated: August 11, 2023 | Original: October 29, 2009 The Revolutionary War (1775-83), also known as the American Revolution, arose from growing tensions between residents of Great Britain’s 13 North American colonies and the colonial government, which represented the British crown. Skirmishes between British troops and colonial militiamen in Lexington and Concord in April 1775 kicked off the armed conflict, and by the following summer, the rebels were waging a full-scale war for their independence. France entered the American Revolution on the side of the colonists in 1778, turning what had essentially been a civil war into an international conflict. After French assistance helped the Continental Army force the British surrender at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781, the Americans had effectively won their independence, though fighting did not formally end until 1783. For more than a decade before the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, tensions had been building between colonists and the British authorities. The French and Indian War, or Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), brought new territories under the power of the crown, but the expensive conflict lead to new and unpopular taxes. Attempts by the British government to raise revenue by taxing the colonies (notably the Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend Acts of 1767 and the Tea Act of 1773) met with heated protest among many colonists, who resented their lack of representation in Parliament and demanded the same rights as other British subjects. Colonial resistance led to violence in 1770, when British soldiers opened fire on a mob of colonists, killing five men in what was known as the Boston Massacre. After December 1773, when a band of Bostonians altered their appearance to hide their identity boarded British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor during the Boston Tea Party, an outraged Parliament passed a series of measures (known as the Intolerable, or Coercive Acts) designed to reassert imperial authority in Massachusetts. Did you know? Now most famous as a traitor to the American cause, General Benedict Arnold began the Revolutionary War as one of its earliest heroes, helping lead rebel forces in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. In response, a group of colonial delegates (including George Washington of Virginia, John and Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, Patrick Henry of Virginia and John Jay of New York) met in Philadelphia in September 1774 to give voice to their grievances against the British crown. This First Continental Congress did not go so far as to demand independence from Britain, but it denounced taxation without representation, as well as the maintenance of the British army in the colonies without their consent. It issued a declaration of the rights due every citizen, including life, liberty, property, assembly and trial by jury. The Continental Congress voted to meet again in May 1775 to consider further action, but by that time violence had already broken out. On the night of April 18, 1775, hundreds of British troops marched from Boston to nearby Concord, Massachusetts in order to seize an arms cache. Paul Revere and other riders sounded the alarm, and colonial militiamen began mobilizing to intercept the Redcoats. On April 19, local militiamen clashed with British soldiers in the Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts, marking the “shot heard round the world” that signified the start of the Revolutionary War. From the roots of the rebellion to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution, explore this pivotal era in American history through sweeping cinematic recreations. When the Second Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia, delegates—including new additions Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson—voted to form a Continental Army, with Washington as its commander in chief. On June 17, in the Revolution’s first major battle, colonial forces inflicted heavy casualties on the British regiment of General William Howe at Breed’s Hill in Boston. The engagement, known as the Battle of Bunker Hill, ended in British victory, but lent encouragement to the revolutionary cause. Throughout that fall and winter, Washington’s forces struggled to keep the British contained in Boston, but artillery captured at Fort Ticonderoga in New York helped shift the balance of that struggle in late winter. The British evacuated the city in March 1776, with Howe and his men retreating to Canada to prepare a major invasion of New York. By June 1776, with the Revolutionary War in full swing, a growing majority of the colonists had come to favor independence from Britain. On July 4, the Continental Congress voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence, drafted by a five-man committee including Franklin and John Adams but written mainly by Jefferson. That same month, determined to crush the rebellion, the British government sent a large fleet, along with more than 34,000 troops to New York. In August, Howe’s Redcoats routed the Continental Army on Long Island; Washington was forced to evacuate his troops from New York City by September. Pushed across the Delaware River, Washington fought back with a surprise attack in Trenton, New Jersey, on Christmas night and won another victory at Princeton to revive the rebels’ flagging hopes before making winter quarters at Morristown. British strategy in 1777 involved two main prongs of attack aimed at separating New England (where the rebellion enjoyed the most popular support) from the other colonies. To that end, General John Burgoyne’s army marched south from Canada toward a planned meeting with Howe’s forces on the Hudson River. Burgoyne’s men dealt a devastating loss to the Americans in July by retaking Fort Ticonderoga, while Howe decided to move his troops southward from New York to confront Washington’s army near the Chesapeake Bay. The British defeated the Americans at Brandywine Creek, Pennsylvania, on September 11 and entered Philadelphia on September 25. Washington rebounded to strike Germantown in early October before withdrawing to winter quarters near Valley Forge. Howe’s move had left Burgoyne’s army exposed near Saratoga, New York, and the British suffered the consequences of this on September 19, when an American force under General Horatio Gates defeated them at Freeman’s Farm in the first Battle of Saratoga. After suffering another defeat on October 7 at Bemis Heights (the Second Battle of Saratoga), Burgoyne surrendered his remaining forces on October 17. The American victory Saratoga would prove to be a turning point of the American Revolution, as it prompted France (which had been secretly aiding the rebels since 1776) to enter the war openly on the American side, though it would not formally declare war on Great Britain until June 1778. The American Revolution, which had begun as a civil conflict between Britain and its colonies, had become a world war. During the long, hard winter at Valley Forge, Washington’s troops benefited from the training and discipline of the Prussian military officer Baron Friedrich von Steuben (sent by the French) and the leadership of the French aristocrat Marquis de Lafayette. On June 28, 1778, as British forces under Sir Henry Clinton (who had replaced Howe as supreme commander) attempted to withdraw from Philadelphia to New York, Washington’s army attacked them near Monmouth, New Jersey. The battle effectively ended in a draw, as the Americans held their ground, but Clinton was able to get his army and supplies safely to New York. On July 8, a French fleet commanded by the Comte d’Estaing arrived off the Atlantic coast, ready to do battle with the British. A joint attack on the British at Newport, Rhode Island, in late July failed, and for the most part the war settled into a stalemate phase in the North. The Americans suffered a number of setbacks from 1779 to 1781, including the defection of General Benedict Arnold to the British and the first serious mutinies within the Continental Army. In the South, the British occupied Georgia by early 1779 and captured Charleston, South Carolina in May 1780. British forces under Lord Charles Cornwallis then began an offensive in the region, crushing Gates’ American troops at Camden in mid-August, though the Americans scored a victory over Loyalist forces at King’s Mountain in early October. Nathanael Green replaced Gates as the American commander in the South that December. Under Green’s command, General Daniel Morgan scored a victory against a British force led by Colonel Banastre Tarleton at Cowpens, South Carolina, on January 17, 1781. By the fall of 1781, Greene’s American forces had managed to force Cornwallis and his men to withdraw to Virginia’s Yorktown peninsula, near where the York River empties into Chesapeake Bay. Supported by a French army commanded by General Jean Baptiste de Rochambeau, Washington moved against Yorktown with a total of around 14,000 soldiers, while a fleet of 36 French warships offshore prevented British reinforcement or evacuation. Trapped and overpowered, Cornwallis was forced to surrender his entire army on October 19. Claiming illness, the British general sent his deputy, Charles O’Hara, to surrender; after O’Hara approached Rochambeau to surrender his sword (the Frenchman deferred to Washington), Washington gave the nod to his own deputy, Benjamin Lincoln, who accepted it. Though the movement for American independence effectively triumphed at the Battle of Yorktown, contemporary observers did not see that as the decisive victory yet. British forces remained stationed around Charleston, and the powerful main army still resided in New York. Though neither side would take decisive action over the better part of the next two years, the British removal of their troops from Charleston and Savannah in late 1782 finally pointed to the end of the conflict. British and American negotiators in Paris signed preliminary peace terms in Paris late that November, and on September 3, 1783, Great Britain formally recognized the independence of the United States in the Treaty of Paris. At the same time, Britain signed separate peace treaties with France and Spain (which had entered the conflict in 1779), bringing the American Revolution to a close after eight long years.

The roof tiles are blue, and the overall design incorporates elements of the color blue. The use of the color blue symbolizes the harmony of Korean traditional culture and the dynamic spirit of South Korea.", "token_usage": 69, "human_written_evidences": [], "reference_documents": [], "model_retrieved_documents": ["", "Jump to Built in 1991 on the gardens of former royal palace Gyeongbokgung, South Korea's Blue House gets its name from its distinctive roof, which is made of 150,000 handmade blue tiles. Across extensive renovations over the past 74 years, the color of the roof has remained the same. The house has served as the office of each South Korean president since 1948, but that's about to change. Newly elected South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, who won the March 9 election, officially announced on March 20 that he would move the presidential office to a defense ministry compound in Yongsan upon his inauguration. Yoon said his decision was motivated by his desire to be a people-first president. \"We are looking to move out of the Blue House, which had been a symbol of absolute power in our history, and return that power to the people,\" Yoon's spokeswoman Kim Eun-hye said in a briefing on March 18, per Reuters. Yoon's team did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. South Koreans view the Blue House as a symbol of \"unchecked power,\" Yonsei University sociology professor Kim Dong-no told The Wall Street Journal. Yoon's political opponents have accused him of listening to the readings of Fengshui practitioners and prioritizing their advice over national security. Fengshui practitioners consider the location of the Blue House to be inauspicious due to the misfortunes of past presidents, Reuters reported. In South Korea's 25-year democratic history, four out of six presidents have either been jailed or died from suicide after leaving office. \"People suspect that the move was motivated by shamans' advice that the location of the Blue House is cursed,\" Democratic Party politician Cho Jeong-sik told the South China Morning Post. In a briefing, the outgoing Moon administration said they felt the rushed relocation efforts could \"create a security vacuum and confusion\" amidst rising tensions with the North, per Reuters. The relocation to a Yongsan defense military compound will cost an estimated 49.6 billion won ($40.1 million), according to figures provided by South Korea's Ministry of Economy and Finance in a press conference, per Reuters. Known as \"The Blue House Raid,\" North Korea sent 31 military commandos to assassinate then-South Korean President Park Chung-he in 1968. The attempt was unsuccessful, and almost all of the soldiers were either killed or committed suicide. Of the two remaining attackers, one managed to return to North Korea, and the other, Kim Shin-jo, was captured by the South. Kim received a pardon and became a South Korean citizen. In 2018, Kim recounted the details of the mission to NBC. He said the soldiers were disguised as South Korean civilians and managed to get within 350 yards of the Blue House before being discovered. Among the Blue House's rooms are a main office building, a presidential residence, a state reception house, and a press hall. It has always been the designated location where the president makes official announcements. It's also where state meetings, press conferences, and special ceremonies are held. South Korean citizens also often stage demonstrations at the grounds outside the Blue House. In April 2015, thousands of people marched towards the Blue House in protest against the government's poor rescue response during the Sewol ferry tragedy. South Korean citizens staged a similar demonstration near the Blue House in November 2016, calling for then-president Park Geun-hye's resignation after a corruption scandal. Park was eventually impeached in 2017 and served almost five years in prison before she was pardoned in December 2021. The Blue House has also hosted other important officials, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, former US Secretary of State John Kerry, and Pope Francis. Visitors are allowed in certain areas of the Blue House, but only through guided tours. However, there are plans to reform the visitor policy under President Yoon Suk-yeol's administration, per Korea JoongAng Daily. Visitors will now be allowed to roam freely around permitted areas without a guide. With this change in policy, the Blue House is expected to welcome up to 39,000 people a day, an increase from the 1,500 visitors that the guided tours currently handle.

It is a sequel to the Academy Award-winning 1983 film Terms of Endearment starring Shirley MacLaine, who reprises the role of Aurora Greenway, for which she won an Oscar in the original film. Who played Debra Wingers Kids in Terms of Endearment? 3/17/2014 12:10 AM PT. Troy Bishop is best known for playing the resentful eldest son Tommy Horton — opposite Jeff Daniels and Debra Winger — in the 1983 family drama “Terms of Endearment.” Guess what he looks like now! How old was Shirley MacLaine in Terms of Endearment? 84-year-old On Tuesday night, Winger, 63, battled away a question from Bravo host Andy Cohen about her relationship with the 84-year-old MacLaine, who won the Best Actress Oscar for playing her mother in 1983’s Terms of Endearment. As a senior citizen, Shirley has known some sorrows, too. She’s been estranged from her daughter, Sachi — who wrote Lucky Me: My Life With – and Without – My Mom, Shirley MacLaine, a Mommie Dearest-type book in 2013 — but remains in contact with her two grandchildren. Who is Shirley MacLaine’s daughter? Sachi Parker Shirley MacLaine/Daughters People would often come up to Sachi Parker to say she must be so lucky to have such a wonderful mother, Oscar-winning actress Shirley MacLaine. Who are the actors in terms of endearment? Cast (in credits order) verified as complete Shirley MacLaine Aurora Greenway Debra Winger Emma Horton Jack Nicholson Garrett Breedlove Danny DeVito Vernon Dahlart Jeff Daniels Flap Horton Terms of Endearment. Emma is diagnosed with cancer, which becomes terminal. Aurora stays by Emma’s side through her treatment and hospitalization, even while dealing with her own pain after Garrett suddenly ends their relationship. The dying Emma shows her love for her mother by entrusting her own children to Aurora’s care. Who is Garrett Breedlove in terms of endearment? Meanwhile, the lonely Aurora overcomes her repression, and begins a whirlwind romance with her next-door neighbor, retired astronaut Garrett Breedlove ( Jack Nicholson ). The Horton family moves from Houston to Des Moines and eventually to Nebraska, apparently for Flap’s college teaching career, but mostly so he can be near his girlfriend. What are the reviews of terms of endearment? The site’s consensus reads: “A classic tearjerker, Terms of Endearment isn’t shy about reaching for the heartstrings – but is so well-acted and smartly scripted that it’s almost impossible to resist.” Metacritic reports a score of 79/100 based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating “Generally favorable reviews”.

{"question": "when did early voting start in the us", "answer": ["1992"], "mgt": "Early voting in the United States usually starts around 15 to 45 days before Election Day, which is typically the first Tuesday of November during a federal election year. The exact starting date can vary from state to state as each state has its own regulations regarding early voting periods. Some states also offer absentee voting which allows voters to cast their ballots by mail before Election Day. Early voting is intended to provide more flexibility for voters who may not be able to vote on Election Day due to various reasons such as work, travel, or personal commitments. Overall, the early voting period aims to increase voter participation and accessibility in the electoral process.", "token_usage": 126, "human_written_evidences": [], "reference_documents": [], "model_retrieved_documents": ["Forty-six states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands offer early in-person voting to all voters (this includes states with all-mail elections). Three states—Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire—do not offer early in-person voting, though they may provide options for eligible absentee voters. In referring to early in-person voting, states use different terminology, including early voting, in-person absentee voting and advance voting. NCSL categorizes a state as having early in-person voting if the option is available to all voters. NCSL distinguishes between “early voting,” which functions similarly to Election Day voting, and “in-person absentee voting,” which is when a voter requests, completes and signs an absentee ballot in a polling place. From the voter’s perspective, however, the experiences of early voting and in-person absentee voting are essentially the same. Additionally, eight states and Washington, D.C., run elections primarily by mail, though all retain some early in-person voting options for voters who need or prefer it. Early in-person voting periods vary by state: Statutes and information about locations, days and hours (if available) are listed below.

Originally written to honor soldiers overseas who longed to be home at Christmas time, \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" has since gone on to become a Christmas standard.[5][6] The song is sung from the point of view of a soldier stationed overseas during World War II, writing a letter to his family. In the message, he tells his family he will be coming home and to prepare the holiday for him, and requests snow, mistletoe, and presents under the tree. The song ends on a melancholy note, with the soldier saying, \"I'll be home for Christmas, if only in my dreams\".[7][6] The flip side of the original recording (Decca 18570B) was \"Danny Boy.\"[1] The song was written by the lyricist Kim Gannon and composer Walter Kent. Songwriter and later producer and manager for The Platters, Buck Ram, who said he previously wrote a poem and song with the same title, was credited as a co-writer of the song following a lawsuit brought by Ram's publisher, Mills Music.[8] Bing Crosby's original 1943 release of the song on Decca Records listed only Walter Kent and Kim Gannon as the songwriters on the record label. Later pressings added the name of Buck Ram to the songwriting credit. On October 1, 1943, Crosby recorded the song under the title \"I'll Be Home for Christmas (If Only in My Dreams)\", with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra for Decca Records;[3] it was released as a 78 rpm single, Decca 18570A, Matrix #L3203, and reissued in 1946 as Decca 23779. Within a month of release, the song charted for 11 weeks, with a peak at number three. The next year, the song reached number 16 on the charts.[9] The U.S. War Department also released Bing Crosby's performance of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" from the December 7, 1944, Kraft Music Hall[10] broadcast with the Henderson Choir, J.S.T., on V-Disc, as U.S. Army V-Disc No. 441-B and U.S. Navy V-Disc No. 221B, Matrix #VP1253-D5TC206.[11] The song from the broadcast has appeared in many Bing Crosby compilations. In the midst of World War II, the song touched the hearts of Americans, both soldiers and civilians, and it earned Crosby his fifth gold record. \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" became the most requested song at Christmas U.S.O. shows.[6] The GI magazine Yank said Crosby \"accomplished more for military morale than anyone else of that era\".[5] Despite the song's popularity with Americans at the front and at home, in the UK the BBC banned the song from broadcast, as the Corporation's management felt the lyrics might lower morale among British troops.[12][6] Seventy-seven years after its original release, Bing Crosby's \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (at number 50 on the chart dated January 2, 2021).[13] Elvis Presley recorded the song in September 1957, and was featured on the LP Elvis' Christmas Album. Singer Johnny Mathis also covered the song on his Merry Christmas album in 1958, which was the #2 Christmas album of 1963 and 1964 as there were no Christmas album rankings prior to 1963. In December 1965, astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, while on Gemini 7, requested \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" be played for them by the NASA ground crew.[20] Since the incarnation of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1958, cover versions by Cuban-American singer Camila Cabello and American singers Kelly Clarkson and Josh Groban are the only versions of the song to enter the chart.

It is one of the season’s most beloved Christmas songs, and royalties from the song are given back to St. Lawrence University each time it is played on the radio. J. Kimball “Kim” Gannon, a graduate of St. Lawrence in 1924, in New York, composed “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” along with two others. It was not Gannon, however, who made the song popular. It was Bing Crosby who first recorded the song in 1943 that became a top-10 hit during the mid-1940s, as Americans were in the midst of World War II. The lyrics resonated with soldiers longing to be home, “if only in my dreams.” “It came out of a time when we had servicemen fighting a war in Europe against tyranny and one day a year, maybe, the serviceman got a breather from fighting and had a chance to reflect on the happy times and the things they would like to get back to.” Gannon is also given credit for writing the alma mater for St. Lawrence. In his will he declared that the University is to be given a portion of his royalties from all his compositions in his will. Since September 2000, St. Lawrence has gained nearly $500,000 from the royalties of Gannon’s music. Gannon died in 1974. No doubt, this time of year invokes memories of Christmases past. Whether it is a fond moment or a moment in time that may have resulted in our tears slowing us down, the song captures our emotions even today, with its powerful lyrics. I am particularly reminded of life as a child when the burden of being responsible was in the great hands of my parents. As I listen to the song, I remember the importance of family. As I have said many times, my mother and father showered us with love and affection-not always verbally, but with their actions. Although my mother was a great cook every day, Christmas really brought out her culinary skills. The smell of her wonderful pies and cakes being cooked and baked on a wooden stove wafting through the house, gave special meaning to the season. It was a time of year that our home was always crowded with guest, black and white, interested in sampling her daily creations. There was an unwritten rule in our family. No matter where life takes you, always come home for Christmas. Except for being out of the country for an extended period, until my parents’ death, I was always home for Christmas."]}

It was a significant milestone as it marked the first time a major international cricket tournament was sponsored by a company from the Indian subcontinent.

All the World Cup events so far have been held in nations in which cricket is a popular sport. Most of the tournaments have been jointly hosted by nations from the same geographical region, such as South Asia in 1987, 1996, and 2011, Australia in 1992 and 2015, Southern Africa in 2003 and West Indies in 2007. England have hosted the most World Cups – a total of 5 (including the first three World Cups). England has hosted the most number of World Cup alone, doing it in 1975 and 1979. In 1983 & 1999, despite being regarded as the only host for the tournament, some matches were played in Ireland, Netherlands, Scotland and Wales. India are the second nation to host the world cup alone in the 2023 edition. The West Indies hosted the tournament in 2007 but are not considered as sole hosts because the West Indies represents a sporting confederation of 15 mainly English-speaking Caribbean countries, British dependencies and non-British dependencies.

Awarded As Per Rotation Policy England hosted the first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to put the resources needed in organising the inaugural event. India proposed that it should host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members believed England was a more suitable venue because longer period of daylight in June. This meant that a match could be completed in one day.[7] 1975, 1979 and 1983† Host: England †In 1983, England are considered as sole hosts. However, one match was played in Swansea, Wales. The first competition hosted outside England was the 1987 Cricket World Cup, which was jointly held in India and Pakistan. A change in location led to a reduction in the number of overs from sixty to fifty in each innings because of the shorter duration of daylight. 1987 Hosts: India and Pakistan The 2007 Cricket World Cup was awarded to the West Indies via the International Cricket Council's rotational policy. It was the first time the Cricket World Cup had been held in the Caribbean despite the fact that the West Indies cricket team had been the second most successful team in past World Cups. Bermuda and the United States unsuccessfully bid for the right to host matches. 2007 Hosts: West Indies 2011 Bids: The ICC originally announced its decision which countries would host the 2011 World Cup on 30 April 2006. Australia and New Zealand's bid for the tournament was the only bid for 2011 delivered to ICC headquarters in Dubai ahead of the 1 March deadline. ICC President Ehsan Mani said the extra time taken by the Asian bloc to hand over its bid compliance book had harmed the four-nation bid. However, when the time came to vote, Asia won the hosting rights by ten votes to three. The Pakistan Cricket Board revealed that it was the vote of the West Indies Cricket Board that swung the matter, as the Asian bid had the support of the four bidding countries along with South Africa and Zimbabwe. It was reported in Pakistani newspaper Dawn that the Asian countries promised to hold fund-raising events for West Indian cricket during the 2007 World Cup, which may have influenced the vote. However, chairman of the Monitoring Committee of the Asian bid, I. S. Bindra, said it was their promise of extra profits in the region of US$400 million that swung the vote, that there \"was no quid pro quo for their support\", and that playing the West Indies had \"nothing to do with the World Cup bid\". After missing out on 2011, Australia and New Zealand were awarded the 2015 World Cup.[8] England was awarded the 2019 event as part of rotational policy.[4] 2011 Voting Result: World cup moved out of Pakistan by the ICC on 17 April 2009[9][10] due to ongoing concerns about the \"uncertain security situation\" prevailing in the country, especially in the aftermath of the 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team in Lahore On 9 April 2009, PCB chairman Ijaz Butt revealed that they had issued a legal notice to oppose ICC decision.[11] However, the ICC claims that PCB is still a co-host and they have only shifted the matches out of Pakistan.[12] Pakistan had proposed that South Africa host the 2015 World Cup and Australia/New Zealand host 2011, however this option did not find favour with their co-hosts and hence didn't materialise.[13] 2011 Hosts: Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka 2015 Hosts: Australia and New Zealand awarded after losing the 2011 hosting bid. On 16 November 2021, ICC published the name of the hosts for ICC events to be played between 2024 and 2031 cycle. The hosts for the 50-over World Cup including T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy were selected through a competitive bidding process overseen by a sub-committee chaired by Sourav Ganguly, former president of the BCCI, Ricky Skerritt, president of Cricket West Indies and Martin Snedden.[14][15] Since the 1983 World Cup in England, an unofficial rotation system was introduced so that each cricket playing region of the world would have the opportunity to host World Cup after every twenty years. However, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Cricinfo, owing to the increasing power and role of the Asian nations, particularly India, this convention has not been strictly adhered to. For example, according to the rotation system, Australia and New Zealand should have been hosts for the event in 2011.[16][17] But, the subcontinent won the bid because it would fetch additional US$ 400 million in profit.[18]", "The Cricket World Cup, the top-level and the most important[citation needed] competition in One Day International cricket, was first played in 1975. This tournament, known as The Prudential World Cup, was played in England and was won by the West Indies. Since then, the tournament has been played every four years, in a number of different countries. Between eight and sixteen teams have contested the various competitions, and lengths of matches have ranged from 60 overs per side in the early tournaments down to 50 overs per side in recent ones. The first cricket Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England. Cricket was contested at the 1900 Summer Olympics where Great Britain defeated France by 158 runs.[1] However, the International Olympic Committee cancelled cricket as an Olympic sport afterwards. The first attempt at arranging an international cricket competition was the 1912 Triangular Tournament. It was a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test playing nations at the time; England, Australia and South Africa. Due to poor weather and a lack of public interest, the experiment was not repeated.[2] From then on, international Test cricket teams only generally engaged in bilateral series as opposed to tournaments or leagues involving more than two nations. In the early 1960s, English county cricket teams began playing a shortened version of cricket, which only lasted for one day. One-day cricket started as a 4-team knockout competition, known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup in 1962[3] and later as the Gillette Cup in 1963, and grew in popularity, resulting in a national league called the Sunday League to be created in 1969. The first One Day International came about from a rain-aborted Test match at Melbourne between England and Australia in 1971 and was played on the final scheduled day. The forty over match (eight balls per over) was used to fill the time as compensation for the frustrated crowd.[4] The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England and other parts of the world as well as the early One-day Internationals prompted the International Cricket Council to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.[5] The Men's Cricket World Cup was first held in 1975 in England, which was the only nation that was able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude.[6] The first three tournaments were officially known as the Prudential Cup after the financial services company Prudential plc who sponsored the event. The matches were of 60 overs per team and played in traditional white uniform and red balls. They were all played during the day. Eight teams participated in the first tournament: Australia, England, the West Indies, Pakistan, India, and New Zealand (the six Test nations at the time), with Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa. One notable omission was the South African cricket team who were not competing due to the international sports boycott. West Indies won the first Cricket World Cup by defeating Australia by 17 runs in the final. The next two World Cups held in 1979 and 1983 were again hosted by England. The 1979 Cricket World Cup saw the introduction of the ICC Trophy, a competition used to select non-Test playing teams for the World Cup.[7] Sri Lanka and Canada qualified through the ICC Trophy in 1979. West Indies again won the World Cup tournament, defeating England by 92 runs. At their meeting which followed the World Cup, the International Cricket Conference agreed to make the competition a four-yearly event. The 1983 event was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this time, Sri Lanka had become a Test playing nation, and Zimbabwe qualified through the ICC Trophy. India were crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final. The odds of India winning the cup were quoted at 66 to 1 before the competition began.[5] The 1987 Cricket World Cup held in India and Pakistan was the first World Cup hosted outside England. It was also the first tournament where the West Indies were unable to reach the final. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight hours on the subcontinent when compared to England. Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs, the closest margin in World Cup final history until 2019. The 1992 Cricket World Cup held by Australia and New Zealand brought many changes to the game such as coloured clothing, white balls, day/night matches and an alteration to the fielding restrictions. It was the first tournament that the South African cricket team played in, following the end of the international sports boycott. Referred as the 'Cornered Tigers' at the time, Pakistan overcame a dismal start to emerge as winners, defeating England by 22 runs in the final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.[8] The 1996 championship was held in the Indian subcontinent for the second time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host of some of its group stage matches. It occurred behind the backdrop of political upheaval in world cricket, after a spiteful Sri Lankan tour of Australia in 1995/96. After the no-balling of Sri Lankan off spinner Muttiah Muralitharan by Darrell Hair in a Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the tour ended in a spiteful ODI final in Sydney which saw physical contact between Glenn McGrath and Sanath Jayasuriya, and the refusal of the Sri Lankans to shake hands at the end of the match. Some Australian players received death threats, which were compounded by a Tamil Tiger bombing in Colombo. Australia and West Indies refused to play their respective matches against Sri Lanka there, causing both matches to be awarded to Sri Lanka by default. After protracted negotiations, Kenya and Zimbabwe agreed to fulfil their fixtures in Sri Lanka. The Australian led boycott drew heavy criticism from subcontinental cricket officials, with former Indian captain Kapil Dev calling for Australia to be expelled. On the field, the abrasive and dry subcontinent surfaces resulted in batting conditions being optimal early in the innings before the ball became softer and more difficult to strike. Of the five leading run-scorers, four were opening batsmen, with Mark Waugh becoming the first batsman to score three centuries in a tournament. Spin bowlers were the most effective, with four of the leading six wicket-takers. The quarter finals saw co-hosts India and Pakistan meet in Bangalore. After Pakistani captain Wasim Akram withdrew due to injury, Ajay Jadeja struck 40 from the last two overs from Waqar Younis, setting Pakistan a target of 288. Pakistan were going well at 109/1, but after Aamer Sohail confronted taunted Indian bowler Venkatesh Prasad after striking a boundary, Prasad bowled him immediately after, sparking a collapse of 3/19, all to Prasad. After falling 39 runs short, the Government of Pakistan launched an inquiry into the performance, after angry protests by the public which left one person dead, and accusations of match-fixing were levelled at Wasim. In the other quarter finals, Australia and Sri Lanka defeated New Zealand and England respectively, while South Africa, who were previously undefeated, were upset by the West Indies. In the semi-final, Sri Lanka, headed towards a crushing victory over India at Eden Gardens (Calcutta) after their hosts slumped to 120/8 from being 98/1 in pursuit of 252, were awarded victory by default after riots broke out in protest against the Indian performance. In the other semi-final in Mohali, Australia defeated the West Indies after the Caribbean team lost their last seven wickets for 29 runs in their run-chase. Sri Lanka went on to claim their inaugural championship by defeating the favourites Australia in the final by seven wickets, held in Lahore. Tension remained between the two sides after the Australian series, with Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga declaring Australian leg spinner Shane Warne in the media before the match, and proceeding to poke his tongue at Warne during the match after hitting a six. Aravinda de Silva was named man of the match, as he was in the semi-final. The 1999 event returned to England after sixteen years with some matches also held in Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands. After losing two matches in the group phase, one of the favourites, Australia needed to avoid defeat in seven consecutive matches to win the title. They subsequently were required to defeat South Africa in the final Super Six match at Headingley. After South Africa had reached 271, Australia were struggling when captain Steve Waugh hit a ball straight to Herschelle Gibbs, who dropped it after trying to throw the ball into the air in celebration, eliciting the barb from Waugh that he had \"dropped the World Cup\". Waugh struck an unbeaten century to guide Australia to their target in their Super Six match against South Africa off the final ball of the match. Australia then faced South Africa again in the semi-final and posted a target of 213. South Africa needed nine runs from the final over with one wicket remaining, with man of the tournament Lance Klusener on strike. He struck the first two balls to the fence, leaving one run from the remaining four balls. However, a mix-up between Klusener and Allan Donald on the fourth ball saw Donald drop his bat and be stranded mid-pitch to be run out. The match was a tie, allowing Australia to advance to the final due to earlier results. In the other semi-final, Pakistan, who had qualified first in both the group and Super Six phase, defeated New Zealand by nine wickets. In the final Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and reached the target in just over 20 overs, with eight wickets in hand. South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. The number of teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen. Because of political pressure and security concerns respectively, Zimbabwe and Kenya were awarded their matches against England and New Zealand respectively, after the latter teams forfeited the matches. Kenya's victories against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others, along with New Zealand's forfeit helped them get a Semi-final berth against India, the best result by an associate. India went on to defeat the Kenyans to set up a final against Australia in Johannesburg, who had defeated Sri Lanka in the other Semi-final. In the final, Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two wickets, the largest ever total in a final, to defeat India by 125 runs.[9] In 2007 the tournament was hosted by the West Indies; the Cricket World Cup became the first such tournament to be hosted on all six populated continents- Europe (1975, 1979, 1983, 1999); Asia (1987, 1996); Australasia (1992); Africa (2003); North and South America (2007).[10] Ireland making their World Cup debut tied with Zimbabwe and defeated Pakistan to progress to the second round, where they went on to defeating Bangladesh to get promoted to the main ODI table.[11] Following their defeat to Ireland, the Pakistani coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room; contrasting reports from different sources say that he was either murdered or died of natural causes.[12] Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the final by 53 runs (D/L), in farcical light conditions, extending their undefeated run in the World Cup to 29 matches and winning three straight World Cups.[13] The 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup was the tenth Cricket World Cup. It was played in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. India won the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, thus becoming the first country to win the Cricket World Cup final on home soil.[14][15] India's Yuvraj Singh was declared the man of the tournament.[16] This was the first time in World Cup history that two Asian teams had appeared in the final. It was also the first time since the 1992 World Cup that the final match did not feature Australia. The number of teams in and the format of the final tournament has varied considerably over the years. In summary: The format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history. The first four tournaments had eight teams each, divided into two groups of four teams each. There were two stages, a group stage and a knockout stage. In the 1975 and 1979 Cricket World Cups, each team played a round-robin, while in the following two tournaments, each team played the rest in their group twice. The top two teams in each group played the semi-finals and the winners of the semi-finals played against each other in the final. In the 1992 Cricket World Cup, all teams played each other once. The top four qualified for the knockout stage which was contested in similar fashion to the previous events. In the 1996 Cricket World Cup, the number of teams increased from nine to twelve and were divided into two groups. The top four teams of each group qualified for the knockout stage this time, which also included quarter-finals. The 1999 Cricket World Cup tournament had a similar group stage format, but there were dramatic changes in the second stage with a \"Super Six\" round replacing the quarter-finals. There were still two groups of six but only three teams from each group went into the subsequent stage. In the Super Six round, each qualifier from Group A played against each qualifier from Group B. The teams earned points from their wins in the Super Six and also brought points scored against the two other teams who qualified from the same group in the group stages. The top four teams from the Super Six played the semi-finals and the rest of the tournament followed in similar fashion to its predecessors. The 2003 event had a similar structure to the 1999 competition. The number of participants rose to fourteen, with seven teams in each pool in the group stage. The Super Six qualifiers also carried forward one point for each win in the group stage against non-qualifiers, a complexity which was dropped for the next world cup.[17] The 2007 Cricket World Cup featured 16 teams allocated into four groups of four. Eleven teams having One Day International status qualified automatically for the tournament while the other five teams were selected from the ICC Trophy. Within each group, the teams played each other in a round-robin format and the top two teams advanced to the \"Super 8\" round. The eight remaining teams then played in a round-robin format, except that they did not play the other team that advanced from their respective group.[18] The top four teams from the Super 8 round advanced to the semi-finals and the winners of the semi-finals then contested the final. In 2007, the Super 8 Round suffered from lack of crowds as a result of the tournament being too long (24 matches), but also due to big teams like India and Pakistan being knocked out of the tournament in the Group Stage.(2007 Cricket World Cup.) As a result, the ICC decided to exclude 2 teams from the 2011 tournament – dividing 14 teams into two groups of seven from which the top 4 teams from each group qualified for the Quarter Finals, this resulted in the addition of more matches into the earlier stages of the tournament as opposed to the second stage. Also adding more knockout matches (seven as opposed to the three in 2007) to increase interest in TV audiences.", "Listen to Story The ICC Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket.

The anniversary marks a five-week long tribute to the tournament, building up to 28 July, the anniversary of the final match. The ICC will publish content that celebrates the event that began global games for both the women’s and men’s games, seeking to pay tribute to the heroes of that era. The tournament opener between Jamaica and New Zealand was washed out without a ball being bowled. The tournament was won by England, who beat Australia by 92 runs at Edgbaston on 28 July 1973, with the trophy presented to the winning captain, Rachel Heyhoe-Flint. The tournament featured seven teams - Australia, England, an International XI, Jamaica, New Zealand, Trinidad & Tobago, and Young England. British businessman Sir Jack Hayward’s liberal sponsorship of GBP 40 000 brought to life the first-ever Cricket World Cup. Having a women’s World Cup before a men’s world event sets cricket apart from other major global sports. To begin celebrations, the ICC has shared several photos from the event on ICC social media channels. The photos include a picture of Jamaica cricketer Paulette Lynch posing with ICC Hall of Famer Heyhoe-Flint, who features in many of the images. Several former players were delighted to share their memories of the inaugural event and what it meant to them and the game. Enid Bakewell MBE was the tournament’s leading run scorer with 264 runs for England, scoring two centuries in four innings at an average of 88.00 and a high score of 118. She said: “My main memories of 1973 are seeing my dad with his rug over his arm coming to me after I had scored a century! A post shared by ICC (@icc) “After the final had been won by England, we were presented to Princess Anne who later gave me an MBE at Buckingham Palace. “Rachael Heyhoe-Flint was the real super woman who fought to promote the women’s game. She took her ukulele to Lord’s and played it outside the ground on the street to let people know that women played cricket. “She was a real inspiration on and off the field.” Lynne Thomas was the second leading run scorer and opened the batting for England. She ended the tournament with 263 runs in four innings that included a highest score of 134, averaging 87.66. She said: “It was a great honour for me to represent England in the first-ever World Cup in 1973. I felt I was also representing my home country, Wales, of which I am very proud. It was a hugely successful tournament played in a true sporting spirit. “The staging of the World Cup in 1973 put a tournament format into the women’s cricket calendar for the first time. It took place every four years and is still being played today. I think that its success has contributed to the forming of other women’s world events such as the T20 World Cup. Being introduced to Her Royal Highness Princess Anne before the final and holding the Cup after the presentation were also major highlights. I have fond memories of the happy times the team spent together. The closeness of the team members, how we blended together and the fun we had. We all enjoyed playing cricket and the friendships we formed will last forever. Louise Browne (Trinidad & Tobago captain): “It does not seem as though 50 years have gone by since I was asked to lead the Trinidad and Tobago women's team to the inaugural Cricket World Cup in 1973. Four members of our squad had attended Cricket Week in Malvern (England) in 1971, but the rest of the team had not travelled beyond the Caribbean borders. “At that inaugural World Cup, we placed fifth among the seven participating teams, with wins only against Young England and Jamaica. Our participation however, brought recognition to women's cricket, not only in Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica, but throughout the Caribbean region. “It is a pleasure to know that women can now play cricket professionally. The franchise tournaments being established worldwide have added excitement to the game. I hope that the present players will continue to be true ambassadors for our sport, and they will represent their country or region with the passion and pride that we did. Women's cricket in Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean, and the world still has a long way to go, but we are on the right track.” Margaret Jennings (Australia): “It was the first time I had ever travelled to the UK along with most of my teammates. “Previously, tours had been once every 10 years but here we were playing against the best teams in the World before anyone else had even thought of it. It was such a wonderful feeling to play against different countries and provided all of us with experiences money could not buy. “Thanks to Rachel Heyhoe-Flint and Sir Jack Hayward we were treated well, and we all felt like real international cricketers in 1973. “The concept of playing against all teams was one to be savoured and the final game against England where we were well and truly beaten, didn’t matter as cricket was the winner. Sharon Tredrea (Australia): “This was the biggest thing to ever happen in women’s cricket, a World Cup format, prior to the men, none of which would have occurred without the amazing work of Rachel Heyhoe-Flint and her friend, Sir Jack Hayward, who sponsored the entire tournament. “For me, representing your country is such a proud moment. To have had the opportunity to participate in this World Cup, now 50 years ago was a privilege. The competition during the World Cup was fierce, but played in a very sporting way, with a lot of respect for opponents. This World Cup showcased the best of the best from around the world and opened the eyes of many who dismissed women’s cricket. “The build-up, once we arrived in England was incredible. It was like nothing any of us had experienced before. Every day, news articles in the major newspapers were published, and to have the opportunity to play on major grounds in the UK was mind blowing. “It created a tournament that has carried on through 50 years, albeit the format changing with the times, now 50 overs not 60, but it was the catalyst for more regular international competitions and the forerunner to the game we now see, boasting professional women cricketers around the world. I was fortunate to go on and play in three more World Cups, winning those three as a member of the Aussie team. “Although it was bitterly disappointing to lose that first final to England, the media loved it and it provided unheard of publicity for the women’s game globally.” ICC Chief Executive, Geoff Allardice paid tribute to the pioneers of the women’s game, saying: “Today is not just a celebration of 50 years of the Women’s Cricket World Cup, but the first-ever Cricket World Cup and gives us the opportunity to recognise the women who were pioneers of our sport. In staging the first ever Cricket World Cup, they set the foundations is place for a vibrant women’s cricket landscape we enjoy today. \"The global growth of women’s cricket is one of the ICC’s six strategic priority projects. Part of this is our mission to grow the number of female cricket fans and participants in the game worldwide and deliver ICC women’s events of equal standing and recognition with men’s events. \"The launch of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in 2009, the professionalization of women’s cricket around the world and the exciting number of global franchise T20 leagues is the fruit of the seed that was planted by Rachel Heyhoe-Flint and her fellow players back in 1973.” This website employs cookies to improve user experience.

The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is considered the \"flagship event of the international cricket calendar\" by the ICC.[5] It is the pinnacle championship of the sport of cricket. The first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament. The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 10 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation, compete for the title at venues within the host nation over about a month. In the 2027 edition, the format will be changed to accommodate an expanded 14-team final competition.[6] A total of twenty teams have competed in the twelve editions of the tournament, with ten teams competing in the recent 2019 tournament. Australia has won the tournament five times, India and West Indies twice each, while Pakistan, Sri Lanka and England have won it once each. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament. England are the current champions after winning the 2019 World Cup edition. The 2023 World Cup in India is ongoing, and the subsequent 2027 World Cup will be held jointly in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia. The first international cricket match was played between Canada and the United States, on 24 and 25 September 1844.[7] However, the first credited Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England, and the two teams competed regularly for The Ashes in subsequent years. South Africa was admitted to Test status in 1889.[8] Representative cricket teams were selected to tour each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic sport at the 1900 Paris Games, where Great Britain defeated France to win the gold medal.[9] This was the only appearance of cricket at the Summer Olympics.[10] The first multilateral competition at international level was the 1912 Triangular Tournament, a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test-playing nations at the time: England, Australia and South Africa. The event was not a success: the summer was exceptionally wet, making play difficult on damp uncovered pitches, and crowd attendances were poor, attributed to a \"surfeit of cricket\".[11] Since then, international Test cricket has generally been organised as bilateral series: a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular Asian Test Championship in 1999.[12] The number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over time, with the addition of West Indies in 1928,[13] New Zealand in 1930,[14] India in 1932,[15] and Pakistan in 1952.[16] However, international cricket continued to be played as bilateral Test matches over three, four or five days. In the early 1960s, English county cricket teams began playing a shortened version of cricket which only lasted for one day. Starting in 1962 with a four-team knockout competition known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup,[17] and continuing with the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963, one-day cricket grew in popularity in England. A national Sunday League was formed in 1969. The first One-Day International match was played on the fifth day of a rain-aborted Test match between England and Australia at Melbourne in 1971, to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd. It was a forty over game with eight balls per over.[18] The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England and other parts of the world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organizing a Cricket World Cup.[19] The inaugural Cricket World Cup was hosted in 1975 by England, the only nation able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude at the time. The first three tournaments were held in England and officially known as the Prudential Cup after the sponsors Prudential plc. The matches consisted of 60 six-ball overs per team, played during daytime in the traditional form, with the players wearing cricket whites and using red cricket balls.[20] Eight teams participated in the first tournament: Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and the West Indies (the six Test nations at the time), together with Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa.[21] One notable omission was South Africa, who were banned from international cricket due to apartheid. The tournament was won by the West Indies, who defeated Australia by 17 runs in the final at Lord's.[21] Roy Fredricks of West Indies was the first batsmen who got hit-wicket in ODI during the 1975 World Cup final.[22] The 1979 World Cup saw the introduction of the ICC Trophy competition to select non-Test playing teams for the World Cup,[23] with Sri Lanka and Canada qualifying.[24] The West Indies won a second consecutive World Cup tournament, defeating the hosts England by 92 runs in the final. At a meeting which followed the World Cup, the International Cricket Conference agreed to make the competition a quadrennial event.[24] The 1983 event was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this stage, Sri Lanka had become a Test-playing nation, and Zimbabwe qualified through the ICC Trophy. A fielding circle was introduced, 30 yards (27 m) away from the stumps. Four fieldsmen needed to be inside it at all times.[25] The teams faced each other twice, before moving into the knock-outs. India was crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final.[19][26] India and Pakistan jointly hosted the 1987 tournament, the first time that the competition was held outside England. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight hours in the Indian subcontinent compared with England's summer.[27] Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in the final, the closest margin in the World Cup final until the 2019 edition between England and New Zealand.[28][29] The 1992 World Cup, held in Australia and New Zealand, introduced many changes to the game, such as coloured clothing, white balls, day/night matches, and a change to the fielding restriction rules. The South African cricket team participated in the event for the first time, following the fall of the apartheid regime and the end of the international sports boycott.[30] Pakistan overcame a dismal start in the tournament to eventually defeat England by 22 runs in the final and emerge as winners.[31] The 1996 championship was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host for some of its group stage matches.[32] In the semi-final, Sri Lanka, heading towards a crushing victory over India at Eden Gardens after the hosts lost eight wickets while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 252, were awarded victory by default after crowd unrest broke out in protest against the Indian performance.[33] Sri Lanka went on to win their maiden championship by defeating Australia by seven wickets in the final at Lahore.[34] In 1999, the event was hosted by England, with some matches also being held in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the Netherlands.[35][36] Twelve teams contested the World Cup. Australia qualified for the semi-finals after reaching their target in their Super 6 match against South Africa off the final over of the match.[37] They then proceeded to the final with a tied match in the semi-final also against South Africa where a mix-up between South African batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald saw Donald drop his bat and stranded mid-pitch to be run out. In the final, Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then reached the target in less than 20 overs and with eight wickets in hand.[38] South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the 2003 World Cup. The number of teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen. Kenya's victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others – and a forfeit by the New Zealand team, which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns – enabled Kenya to reach the semi-finals, the best result by an associate.[39] In the final, Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two wickets, the largest ever total in a final, defeating India by 125 runs.[40][41] In 2007, the tournament was hosted by the West Indies and expanded to sixteen teams.[42] Following Pakistan's upset loss to World Cup debutants Ireland in the group stage, Pakistani coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room.[43] Jamaican police had initially launched a murder investigation into Woolmer's death but later confirmed that he died of heart failure.[44] Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the final by 53 runs (D/L) in farcical light conditions, and extended their undefeated run in the World Cup to 29 matches and winning three straight championships.[45] India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh together hosted the 2011 World Cup. Pakistan was stripped of its hosting rights following the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in 2009, with the games originally scheduled for Pakistan redistributed to the other host countries.[46] The number of teams participating in the World Cup was reduced to fourteen.[47] Australia lost their final group stage match against Pakistan on 19 March 2011, ending an unbeaten streak of 35 World Cup matches, which had begun on 23 May 1999.[48] India won their second World Cup title by beating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, making India the first country to win the World Cup at home.[47] This was also the first time that two Asian countries faced each other in a World Cup Final.[49] Australia and New Zealand jointly hosted the 2015 World Cup. The number of participants remained at fourteen. Ireland was the most successful Associate nation with a total of three wins in the tournament. New Zealand beat South Africa in a thrilling first semi-final to qualify for their maiden World Cup final. Australia defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in the final at Melbourne to lift the World Cup for the fifth time.[50] The 2019 World Cup was hosted by England and Wales. The number of participants was reduced to 10. New Zealand defeated India in the first semi-final, which was pushed over to the reserve day due to rain.[51] England defeated the defending champions, Australia, in the second semi-final. Neither finalist had previously won the World Cup. In the final, the scores were tied at 241 after 50 overs and the match went to a super over, after which the scores were again tied at 15. The World Cup was won by England, whose boundary count was greater than New Zealand's.[52][53] From the first World Cup in 1975 up to the 2019 World Cup, the majority of teams taking part qualified automatically. Until the 2015 World Cup this was mostly through having Full Membership of the ICC, and for the 2019 World Cup this was mostly through ranking position in the ICC ODI Championship.[54] Since the second World Cup in 1979 up to the 2019 World Cup, the teams that qualified automatically were joined by a small number of others who qualified for the World Cup through the qualification process. The first qualifying tournament being the ICC Trophy;[55] later the process expanding with pre-qualifying tournaments. For the 2011 World Cup, the ICC World Cricket League replaced the past pre-qualifying processes; and the name \"ICC Trophy\" was changed to \"ICC Men's Cricket World Cup Qualifier\".[56] The World Cricket League was the qualification system provided to allow the Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC more opportunities to qualify. The number of teams qualifying varied throughout the years.[57] From the 2023 World Cup onwards, only the host nation(s) will qualify automatically. All countries will participate in a series of leagues to determine qualification, with automatic promotion and relegation between divisions from one World Cup cycle to the next.[58] The format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history. Each of the first four tournaments was played by eight teams, divided into two groups of four.[59] The competition consisted of two stages, a group stage and a knock-out stage. The four teams in each group played each other in the round-robin group stage, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals played against each other in the final. With South Africa returning in the fifth tournament in 1992 as a result of the end of the apartheid boycott, nine teams played each other once in the group phase, and the top four teams progressed to the semi-finals.[60] The tournament was further expanded in 1996, with two groups of six teams.[61] The top four teams from each group progressed to quarter-finals and semi-finals.[62] A distinct format was used for the 1999 and 2003 World Cups. The teams were split into two pools, with the top three teams in each pool advancing to the Super 6.[63] The Super 6 teams played the three other teams that advanced from the other group. As they advanced, the teams carried their points forward from previous matches against other teams advancing alongside them, giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages.[63] The top four teams from the Super 6 stage progressed to the semi-finals, with the winners playing in the final.[64][65] The format used in the 2007 World Cup involved 16 teams allocated into four groups of four.[66] Within each group, the teams played each other in a round-robin format. Teams earned points for wins and half-points for ties. The top two teams from each group moved forward to the Super 8 round. The Super 8 teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points in the same way as the group stage, but carried their points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the Super 8 stage.[67] The top four teams from the Super 8 round advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals played in the final.[68] The format used in the 2011 and 2015[69] World Cups featured two groups of seven teams, each playing in a round-robin format. The top four teams from each group proceeded to the knock out stage consisting of quarter-finals, semi-finals and ultimately the final.[70] In the 2019 and 2023 editions of the tournament, the number of teams participating dropped to 10. Each team is scheduled to play against each other once in a round robin format, before entering the semifinals,[71] a similar format to the 1992 World Cup. The 2027 and 2031 World Cups will have 14 teams, with the format same as the 2003 edition.[72] [73] The ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy is presented to the winners of the World Cup. The current trophy was created for the 1999 championships, and was the first permanent prize in the tournament's history. Prior to this, different trophies were made for each World Cup.[74][clarification needed] The trophy was designed and produced in London by a team of craftsmen from Garrard & Co over a period of two months.[75][76] The current trophy is made from silver and gilt, and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns. The columns, shaped as stumps and bails, represent the three fundamental aspects of cricket: batting, bowling and fielding, while the globe characterises a cricket ball.[77] The seam is tilted to symbolize the axial tilt of the Earth. It stands 60 centimetres (24 in) high and weighs approximately 11 kilograms (24 lb). The names of the previous winners are engraved on the base of the trophy, with space for a total of twenty inscriptions. The ICC keeps the original trophy. A replica differing only in the inscriptions is permanently awarded to the winning team.[78] The tournament is one of the world's most-viewed sporting events,[79][80][81] and successive tournaments have generated increasing media attention as One-Day International cricket has become more established.[dubious – discuss] The 2011 Cricket World Cup was televised in over 200 countries to over 2.2 billion viewers.[75][82][better source needed][dubious – discuss] Television rights, mainly for the 2011 and 2015 World Cup, were sold for over US$1.1 billion,[83] and sponsorship rights were sold for a further US$500 million.[84] The ICC claimed a total of 1.6 billion viewers for the 2019 World Cup as well as 4.6 billion views of digital video of the tournament.[85] The most-watched match of the tournament was the group game between India and Pakistan, which was watched by more than 300 million people live.[86] On 13 February 2015, the opening of the 2015 Cricket World Cup was celebrated with a Google Doodle.[87] On 5 October 2023, the opening of the 2023 Cricket World Cup was celebrated with a Google Doodle.[88] Mascots were introduced to the Cricket World Cup in the 1992 edition, bringing an innovative spirit to the tournament. There have since been different mascots for each World Cup. After the 2011 Cricket World Cup, mascots were temporarily discontinued, and no mascots were announced in the 2015 and 2019 editions. However, the mascots were reintroduced ahead of the 2023 World Cup. The International Cricket Council's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining the bids made by the nations keen to hold a Cricket World Cup.[97] England hosted the first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the resources required to organising the inaugural event.[98] India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in one day.[99] The 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in India and Pakistan, the first hosted outside England.[100] Many of the tournaments have been jointly hosted by nations from the same geographical region, such as South Asia in 1987, 1996 and 2011, Australasia (in Australia and New Zealand) in 1992 and 2015, Southern Africa in 2003 and West Indies in 2007. In November 2021, ICC published the name of the hosts for ICC events to be played between 2024 and 2031 cycle. The hosts for the 50-over World Cup along with T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy were selected through a competitive bidding process.[101][102] England Wales Scotland Ireland Netherlands [a] [b] Twenty nations have qualified for the Cricket World Cup at least once. Seven teams have competed in every tournament, six of which have won the title.[19] The West Indies won the first two tournaments, Australia has won five, India has won two, while Pakistan, Sri Lanka and England have each won once. The West Indies (1975 and 1979) and Australia (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015) are the only teams to have won consecutive titles.[19] Australia has played in seven of the twelve finals (1975, 1987, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015). New Zealand has yet to win the World Cup, but has been runners-up two times (2015 and 2019). The best result by a non-Test playing nation is the semi-final appearance by Kenya in the 2003 tournament; while the best result by a non-Test playing team on their debut is the Super 8 (second round) by Ireland in 2007.[19] Sri Lanka, as a co-host of the 1996 World Cup, was the first host to win the tournament, though the final was held in Pakistan.[19] India won in 2011 as host and was the first team to win a final played in their own country.[103] Australia and England repeated the feat in 2015 and 2019 respectively.[50] Other than this, England made it to the final as a host in 1979. Other countries which have achieved or equalled their best World Cup results while co-hosting the tournament are New Zealand as finalists in 2015, Zimbabwe who reached the Super Six in 2003, and Kenya as semi-finalists in 2003.[19] In 1987, co-hosts India and Pakistan both reached the semi-finals, but were eliminated by England and Australia respectively.[19] Australia in 1992, England in 1999, South Africa in 2003, and Bangladesh in 2011 have been host teams that were eliminated in the first round.[104] An overview of the teams' performances in every World Cup is given below. For each tournament, the number of teams in each finals tournament (in brackets) are shown. Legend The table below provides an overview of the performances of teams over past World Cups, as of the end of the 2019 tournament.

Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will also be watching with interest - with all three sides playing in the play-offs next March. But the unique nature of this tournament - with the qualified countries of the 12 host cities having to be placed in specific groups - means some things have already been decided. England know which group they will be in - while there are only two options for Wales. So what do we know - and why? What are the best and worst-case scenarios for the British nations? And how can you follow it? England already know they will be in Group D because Wembley is hosting three games in that group. The winners of Scotland's Euro 2020 play-offs (Path C) will also be in the group. The Three Lions and Scotland could end up in a group with world champions France and European champions Portugal, because they are among the second and third seeds respectively. Seeding is based on positions and then points in the qualifying groups, rather than world rankings. But a kinder draw would see them in with Poland and the Czech Republic, ranked 21st and 43rd in the world respectively. England met the Czechs in qualifying, winning 5-0 at Wembley but losing 2-1 in Prague. England will host all three of their group games, with Scotland at Hampden Park in their other two games if they qualify. Steve Clarke's side need to get past Israel at home on 26 March and then Norway or Serbia away five days later to qualify. That means England will not know all their opponents until 31 March. Statisticians Gracenote give Scotland a 19% chance of qualifying, with Norway most likely to progress at 40%. There are only two groups Wales could be in - A or B. Group B, which has already been finalised apart from Wales or Finland, would see Ryan Giggs' side in with Belgium, Russia and Denmark. They beat the first two of those on their way to the Euro 2016 semi-finals and lost twice to Denmark in last year's Nations League. If they are in Group A - Italy's group - they could end up with the Azzurri, France and Portugal - or Italy, Poland and the Czech Republic. Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis at Gracenote, says: \"There is probably not much difference between A and B for Wales pre-draw. If either the Czech Republic or Austria ended up in Group A though, Wales would not be the outsiders to progress.\" The other home nation still keeping a close eye on the draw are Northern Ireland. They are in the March play-offs, away to Bosnia-Herzegovina in the semi-finals and at home to the Republic of Ireland or Slovakia in the final - if they beat the Bosnians first. The winners of those play-offs will be in Group E with Spain. Two of their group games will be in Dublin, with the game against Spain in Bilbao. The most difficult group for Northern Ireland (or the Republic) would see them in with Spain, France and Portugal. The easiest according to the world rankings would be Spain, Poland and the Czech Republic. Gracenote say Northern Ireland have a 21% chance, with a 16% chance for the Republic of Ireland. Bosnia are clear favourites, with a 39% probability of winning. Ukraine and the Netherlands are in Group C, while Germany do not know any of their opponents in Group F yet. These two groups are linked because Bucharest hosts half the Group C games, with three Group F fixtures in Budapest. But Romania and Hungary are both in the Path A play-offs - so only one can qualify. If Romania win the play-offs, they will go into Group C with Ukraine and the Netherlands - and the Path D side will be in Group F. If Iceland, Bulgaria or Hungary win Path A they will go into Group F with Germany, with the Path D winner going into Group C. Euro 2020 runs from 12 June to 12 July, with Italy involved in the opening game at the Stadio Olimpico - with the final at Wembley With the play-off winners not being decided until 31 March, only 11 teams are waiting to find out which group they will be in. There are four groups France, Poland, Switzerland and Croatia could be placed in - and five possibilities for third seeds Portugal, Turkey, Austria, Sweden and the Czech Republic. Then Wales and Finland will be in Group A or B. The draw starts with teams from Pot 1 (ie the top seeds) - although we already know which group each of them will be placed in. To determine the position of the team in the group - eg A1, A2, A3 or A4 - a ball is drawn from a bowl. This decides the order of who plays when in the group. England's three games are on Sunday, 14 June, Friday, 19 June and Tuesday, 23 June - but they do not yet know when the potential Scotland game would be. The draw continues with Pot 2, 3 and 4 to decide which group they are in, and then which position of that group they take. That means Wales will not discover their group until nearly the end of the draw. So much has already been decided because any hosts who qualify need to be placed in the group that their home games are in. So England and Scotland (if they qualify) have been destined to play in the same group since a random draw on 7 December 2017 - likewise Spain and the Republic of Ireland. Because four of the top seeds are hosts, their groups are set in stone - so there were only two groups left that the other two top seeds could go in. But Ukraine are not allowed to be in a group with Russia for political reasons (although they could meet in the knockouts) so it means there was only one group they could go in, leaving Belgium in the other. And with the four play-off winners needing to go in specific groups (even though two of them may be swapped around) it means there are only two possible groups that Wales and Finland - also bottom seeds as the two teams to qualify with the fewest points - can be placed in. The draw will be shown live on BBC Two and on the BBC Sport website, alongside a live text commentary, from 17:00 until 18:30 GMT. Mark Chapman will be presenting with former Wales boss Mark Hughes, ex-England defender Micah Richards and French football journalist Julien Laurens. The uninterrupted feed of the draw will be available on the BBC Red Button and BBC Sport website. You can also listen to the draw during Sports Report on BBC Radio 5 Live. England benefit from hosting all their group games, as well as the semi-finals and final - so it is possible to map out where all their games would be in the tournament. There is one last-16 tie at Wembley, although Gareth Southgate's side could not play in that one. The top two teams from each group go through to the last 16, along with the four best third-placed teams. That means only eight teams actually go out in the group stages. Wales will face at least one trip to Azerbaijan or Russia - with their two possible groups being hosted in Rome-Baku or Copenhagen-St Petersburg.

The article deals with the series' main, recurring, and minor characters. Chin Ho Kelly (portrayed by Daniel Dae Kim) is a member of the Five-0 task force and cousin of Kono Kalakaua.[1] Kim also portrayed Chin in a crossover episode with NCIS: Los Angeles, and in another crossover episode with MacGyver. Daniel Dae Kim was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actor: Action, in 2011 and 2012, for his portrayal of Chin.[2] Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly is the third member of Five-0. He was a former Honolulu Police Department police officer who left the force due to false allegations of corruption. He is close friends with the McGarrett family as his late father Kam Tong was a long-time colleague of John in the HPD while Chin was trained by John during his rookie days patrolling the beat.[3] In the pilot episode he was recruited by Steve for the new task force and often serves as the team's technical expert and designated sniper alongside his cousin Kono. Throughout the show, he is often seen manipulating the smart board in the office or fiddling with all things digital. He was married to Dr. Malia Waincroft, his long-time on-and-off girlfriend. Chin attended Kukui High School and was the star quarterback until McGarrett broke his records as a sophomore. After that season, McGarrett was sent off to a military school on the mainland. As a high school student, Chin was described as being multi-talented with a wide variety of interests, having played football and was also in the math club and school band.[4] Little is known about his early career with the Honolulu Police Department except that he had been assigned to District 5 (in real life, covering the areas from Kalihi to Salt Lake) and that Steve's father John was his training officer. He rose to the rank of Detective Lieutenant before leaving over false allegations that he had stolen money from the evidence locker. From his resignation up until Steve's return to Hawaii, Chin was working as a security guard. It is eventually revealed that it was his uncle, a retired cop himself, who had done it out of desperation over the expenses for his cancer-stricken wife's treatments. Kono confronts Chin about it but he flatly refused to turn his uncle in for fear that it would cause all the cases his uncle had solved to be reopened and the criminals would be released. After it became known that the allegations against Chin were false, he was reinstated to his rank and his badge returned to him. In the season 2 finale cliffhanger, Chin is put in a difficult position after a group of corrupt ex-HPD cops simultaneously hold Kono hostage and threaten Malia in the couple's own house as part of a plot to free Frank Delano from Halawa. He chose to save his wife but Delano still orders his men to kill both women. Kono, bound and gagged, was pushed into the sea but was rescued by Adam, who was hiding nearby. The paramedics were unable to save Malia and she dies at home. It is revealed in Season 4 that Chin's father was murdered fifteen years ago by his brother-in-law Gabriel Waincroft, who grew up to become a notorious drug lord despite Chin's efforts to set him straight. At that time, Chin and Malia, then rookies in their respective occupations, were dating and Malia had asked Chin to talk to her wayward younger brother, then a known juvenile delinquent. Kam Tong happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time when Gabriel was ordered to kill someone as part of his gang initiation. Years later, at Kono and Adam's wedding, Gabriel confronts Chin and tells him that while he was sorry that Kam Tong was the unfortunate victim of his gang initiation, he blamed Chin for failing to protect Malia. Unlike the other Five-0 members, Chin often rides a motorcycle to work. It has been said that \"everyone\" knew who Chin was and his intimate knowledge of the island of Oahu and Hawaiian culture, rapport with the locals and ability to speak Hawaiian often aids the team when dealing with locals who are often suspicious of haole cops (such as Danny). His \"street smarts\" and local knowledge complements Danny's experience as a detective and McGarrett's tactical know-how. In Season 6 Chin starts a relationship with Detective Abby Dunn and that continued throughout the course of the season in to Season 7. Also in season 6, Five-0 investigates a woman's murder where the woman's daughter, Sara, claims to have an uncle in the HPD: Chin. Chin learns that Sara's aunt was his deceased wife Malia, as the girl is Gabriel Waincroft's daughter.[5] Soon after, before he dies, Gabriel apologizes for killing Chin's father and asks Chin to take care of Sara.[6] At the beginning of season 7, Chin tries to get custody of the orphaned Sara, but her aunt and uncle on her mother's side win and take her to Mexico.[7] Following Sara's kidnapping by the Diego drug cartel in a plot of revenge against Five-0, Sara's aunt and uncle relinquish her custody to Chin for her safety[8][9] At the end of Season 7, Chin is offered a chance to run the Five-0 Task Force that is being established by the San Francisco Police Department; it is revealed in the Season 8 premiere that he accepted and moved there with Abby and Sara. Chin's pistol of choice is the SIG-Sauer P229R. He previously used the HPD standard-issue Smith & Wesson Model 5906. Officer Kono Kalakaua is a fresh HPD academy graduate who was recruited by Steve for the new task force in the pilot episode. She is the cousin of Chin Ho Kelly. Despite her slight frame, she is well-versed in martial arts and is a skilled marksman (she is usually the designated sniper when the situation requires one). Kono was a former professional surfer but a serious injury to her knee ended her career. She decides to join the \"family trade\" and was days away from graduating from the HPD academy when McGarrett recruited her for the new \"Governor's Task Force\", as Five-0 was initially called. In the first several episodes of season 1, she works under the watchful eye of her cousin and quickly wins the trust and confidence of the other team members. She is detained and questioned by the HPD, having been accused of stealing $10 million from an HPD asset forfeiture locker. While on suspension, she helps Chin and Danny go after Wo Fat, who was responsible for framing McGarrett for the murder of the Governor. To the members of the Five-0 task force and to the general public, Kono had been stripped of her badge by the Internal Affairs Department of the HPD, but it was later revealed to be a ploy for her to go undercover to bust a string of dirty ex-cops. In Season 2, Kono began a relationship with Hiro Noshimuri's son, Adam. When Adam's brother, Michael, is released from prison, he kills someone with Kono's gun to frame her. She is cleared, but Adam has to kill Michael to protect her and Kono goes into hiding with Adam, skipping from one place to another to evade capture by vengeful yakuza members. At the beginning of Season 5, Adam starts to talk about marriage, and in the episode \"Blackout\" Kono accepts his proposal. They marry at the end of the season, but in the Season 6 pilot they are tortured by Chin's brother-in-law, Gabriel, who runs away with Adam's money. The money was to pay the yakuza to free Adam from his past. Without the money the yakuza's men persecute Adam and he is forced to kill them before discovering that Gabriel has paid off his debt with the yakuza. Upset, Adam goes to the police with Kono and he takes a plea deal for 18 months in prison. At the end of Season 7, Kono left Hawaii for Carson City, Nevada, where she joined a multi-agency task force combating sex trafficking. In the season 8 episode I Ka Wa Ma Mua, I Ka Wa Ma Hope (The Future is in the Past) Danny dreams of the future and Kono has a child with Adam. However, midway through season 9, Adam returns to Hawaii and tells the team he and Kono have broken up. Mary Ann McGarrett is the younger sister of Steve McGarrett. She, along with her brother, were both sent to the mainland after their mother was (presumably) murdered. Steve went to the Army and Navy Academy in Carlsbad, California, while she lived with their Aunt Deb several hours away. As a result, both siblings had harbored resentment over their father splitting up the family and drifted apart over the years; in the episode \"Lanakila\", she comments to her brother that the last time they met in person was at their mom's funeral over fifteen years ago. She is the \"black sheep\" of the family, wandering from job to job, and was said to be living in Los Angeles when Steve returns to Hawaii for good. In a scene deleted from the Pilot episode, Steve mentions bailing her out of trouble more than once and keeping it from their father to \"let Dad go to his grave believing that you were his perfect little girl\". She takes a job as a flight attendant but quit after her so-called friend Angela had betrayed her and took advantage of her naivete to be a mule for trafficking blood diamonds. In season 3 Mary returned to Hawaii working as a caretaker, originally not wanting to reconnect with Doris she later meets her after strong encouragement from Steve and the person she was caring after. In season 4, Mary adopts a baby girl and names her Joan, after her father. Steve was initially against it but he comes to accept Joan after being forced to babysit her for the day. Since then, Mary and Steve have reconnected and she regularly sends him videos of Joan. In the original show, Mary Ann only appeared in a two-episode arc. She was also estranged from her brother and was married and had an infant son who died of cancer. She was portrayed by Nancy Malone. In the reboot, the character features more in Steve's life and reconnected with him. Dr. Max Bergman is a former medical examiner who belonged to the City and County of Honolulu. Bergman was initially billed as a recurring character but Oka joined as a series regular and has been part of the main cast since Season 2.[10] Dr. Bergman was first introduced to Five-0 by Governor Jameson. He was playing the piano and then wordlessly proceeded to explain the victim's cause of death to Danny and McGarrett, before finally greeting them and introducing himself. He has the tendency to rattle off trivia, prompting the Five-0 team to cut him off and tell him to get to the point. Danny often mocks him with medical jokes. Despite his lack of social skills, he does get along with the other members of Five-0. He has a Halloween tradition of dressing up as a character from a Keanu Reeves film. In the season 2 episode \"Haʻalele\", it is revealed that his biological mother, Machiyo Takeshita, was murdered by the notorious \"Trashman\", a serial killer in Hawaii from the 1980s who earned the nickname because his victims were all found in trash bags or the dumpster. He was born to a Japanese-American mother but adopted by a Jewish[11] family, the Bergmans, after a short stint in foster care, hence his last name. As an undergraduate at Arizona State University, he was a self-confessed party boy and earned the nickname \"Beerman\".[12] Dr. Bergman is dating Sabrina Lane, a bank teller at Hawaii National Bank. He first saw her in the episode \"Haʻawe Make Loa / Death Wish\" while at the bank and had a crush on her at first sight. A botched bank robbery took place minutes later resulting in Sabrina being shot and Dr. Bergman having to put his medical expertise to use while being held hostage. Following the incident, he eventually works up the nerve to ask her out. It is implied that they are in a relationship (as of Season 6 Episode 14) as she is mentioned by Dr. Bergman numerous times in conversations with other members of Five-0; Rumer Willis, who portrays Sabrina, has only appeared twice on the show. It is revealed in the season 7 episode \"Ka hale ho'okauwel / House of Horrors\" that he married Sabrina during his sabbatical.[13] Max retired from the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office and from Five-0 in the season 7 episode \"Ua ho'i ka 'opua i Awalua\" and returned to Africa as a member of Doctors Without Borders. Special Agent Lori Weston is a former DHS agent with a background as a profiler. Due to the circumstances of her assignment McGarrett initially views her with suspicion and assigns her to \"babysit\" the victim's parents in a kidnapping case on her first day on the job.[14] A graduate of Pennsylvania State University,[14] her background as a federal agent proves to be an asset, as she is able to take down suspects and quickly proves her worth. She returns to the DHS at Governor Denning's request when Five-0 get tangled in an incident with an employee of the Russian consulate. As Catherine Rollins was deployed, she spends a lot of time with McGarrett, but the latter regards her a good friend rather than a romantic interest. She had developed a crush on him, but realizes that McGarrett has always been in love with Catherine. Before her departure, she hands him the UH season tickets she had bought. The character is based on Lori Wilson, interpreted by Sharon Farrell in the original series of 1968. She becomes the principal of the series in the twelfth season. Lieutenant Catherine \"Cath\" Rollins, USN (Ret.) is the on-off lover of Steve McGarrett. How or when they met is never fully explained, but it has been implied that they have known each for a long time. Their first date was revealed to have been in 2002. It is likely they would have had to keep their relationship a secret due to strict fraternization rules in the U.S. military and the fact that McGarrett outranked her. Cath is a \"Navy brat\" and moved around frequently due to her father's various assignments.[15] During Pro Bowl weekend, when asked why she supported the Dallas Cowboys, she explained that had never stayed in any one place long enough to feel an affinity for an NFL team.[16] She herself joined the Navy and is an Intelligence Officer. Like McGarrett, her military service record remains vague. She previously dated Billy Harrington, one of McGarrett's SEAL buddies whom she had worked with. Cath is first introduced in the Season 1 episode \"Lanakila\", when McGarrett calls her for \"a favor\".[17] Later in the season, she stays with him while on leave, resulting in Danny commenting on how McGarrett had \"that stupid smile\" despite being called in on a Saturday to work a murder-abduction case.[15] In the season 4 episode \"Makani ʻolu a holo malie/Fair Winds and Following Seas\", Cath persuades McGarrett to go with her to Afghanistan to find a young boy named Najib. Najib's father had saved her when she was injured and separated from her unit while deployed to Kabul. McGarrett was captured by Taliban insurgents and is nearly beheaded but a team of Navy SEALs rescue him in the nick of time. As a result, he escapes a court-martial and returns stateside with a stern warning that \"these rogue ops of yours are over\". Cath decides to remain in Afghanistan to continue her search for Najib and bids a tearful goodbye to McGarrett over the satellite phone. It was implied that McGarrett never really moved on, as he never indicated any interest in any of the women Danny or Ellie Clayton attempted to set him up with. Cath makes a surprise return in the season 5 finale for Kono and Adam's wedding. Steve welcomes her with a hug when she surprises him at his backyard. She remained for the first three episodes of the series sixth season however she leaves once again before Steve is able to propose, saying that she had something to do. A heartbroken Steve tells her that he could not wait for her any longer if she decides to leave again, and she departs in tears. However, she makes a call to an unidentified person stating that Steve believed her story and that she was \"ready\". She once again returned in the series seventh season for the shows 150th episode to inform Steve that his mother had been detained following an attempt to break Wo Fat's father out of prison. She assists Steve and the rest of the Five-0 Task Force in rescuing Doris McGarrett and Wo Fat's father. She returns again in the eighth season's twentieth episode, getting Steve's help once again to find someone making dirty bombs out of an unused military bunker's depleted uranium. In the series finale, Catherine cracks the show's final mystery- a cypher Steve's dead mother Doris had left for him. This aids in the capture of the show's final villain- the wife of McGarrett's long-time nemesis Wo Fat. In the final moments of the series, Steve and Catherine are reunited as they get ready to depart Hawaii. The following are the awards and decorations worn by Lt. Rollins. In \"Kaʻoia iʻo Ma Loko\", Catherine is honorably discharged from the United States Navy and is awarded her second Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal as an end-of-tour award. Captain Louis Purnell \"Lou\" Grover[19] is the former head of the Honolulu Police Department SWAT Team. He was often at loggerheads with McGarrett over what he felt was Five-0's tendency to be trigger-happy with armed suspects and refusal to obey a \"wait for SWAT\" order, to the point where he lodges an official complaint with Governor Denning. The Governor dismissed Grover's complaint and then promptly orders the duo on an assignment to serve a warrant for a computer hacker. By the latter half of Season 4, he is fully accepted into the Five-0 ohana. In the season 4 finale, Grover's actions to rescue his daughter result in forced early retirement from HPD, but also allows McGarrett to recruit him to be part of the Five-0 team, which he accepts. The character was named after a Captain Grover (Scott Brady) from the original series.[20] A 25-year veteran of the force, Grover graduated from the Chicago Police Academy in 1989, and was promptly recruited by the FBI to go undercover in the Philadelphia Black Mafia. Upon the completion of the assignment, he returned to the Chicago Police Department.[21] He left Chicago around 2012 or 2013, after an incident where he blames himself for having failed to save a boy who was taken hostage by his father, which ultimately resulted in a murder-suicide.[22] He and his wife Renée (portrayed by Michelle Hurd) have two adolescent children: daughter Samantha (portrayed by Paige Hurd) and son Will (portrayed by Chosen Jacobs). The Grovers are a close-knit family and Lou is shown to be a doting father who is fair but firm with his children. As Danny also has a daughter, Grover sometimes gives him tips and unsolicited advice on dealing with preteens.[23] Although he loves his wife and vice versa, he has a tendency to forget important dates such as birthdays, anniversaries and Valentine's Day. In season 6, he forgets about Valentine's Day and hastily makes plans but Renée saw through it and he ends up in the doghouse as a result.[19] The Grovers live in the Honolulu neighborhood of Manoa.[21] Despite Grover's rocky introduction to the Five-0 team, he has since become a valued member of the team. He has an ongoing good-natured rivalry with McGarrett. McGarrett would light-heartedly joke about Grover being a \"city boy\" out of his element on a tropical island[24] while Grover would poke fun about McGarrett getting himself into trouble because of his refusal to ask for help. Unlike McGarrett, Danny Williams took longer to accept Grover but they bond over the fact that they are the only members of the team with children and would often vent their frustrations to one another about parenting issues. Their friendship becomes slightly awkward after both discover that Will and Grace had been dating behind their backs.[25] Grover's weapon of choice is the Kimber Warrior. Jerry Ortega is a conspiracy theorist who lives in his mother's basement (until she moves to Maui) who regularly assists the Five-0 Task Force with various cases. He was first introduced in the episode \"Ka 'oia'i'o ma loko / The Truth Within\". Jerry was classmates with Chin Ho Kelly at Kukui High and they were in the school band. A running gag in the show is the fact that he is either resistant or reluctant to use cellular technology to communicate with McGarrett (e.g. he once used a rotary phone to directly call McGarrett about updates for a case) and tends to ramble about conspiracies over everything. The Five-0 team largely tolerate and humor him as more often than not, his conspiracy theorist ramblings provide the team with a lead or valuable insight into a case. After much pestering, in season 6, McGarrett finally lets Jerry have his own \"office\"—an empty file storage room in the basement—and officially hires him as a \"consultant\". Jerry is a fan of Elvis Presley, which was discovered when Five-0 was called to investigate a murder of an Elvis impersonator in the episode \"Ua heleleʻi ka hoku / Fallen Star\". In the same episode he shows off his musical talent by singing at the open mic when hanging out with the team for drinks after the case. While his job officially is a consultant, he operates behind the scenes as a technical operator, often providing information about the cases Five-0 investigates or technical support when they are in the field. In the episode 'Ua Malo'o Ka Wai', Jerry is awarded his very own Five-0 badge after he coordinates with Duke Lukela and HPD to rescue Five-0 from the Yakuza. In the season 10 premiere, it is revealed that Jerry had been shot, continuing the cliffhanger left in the Season 9 finale. Two weeks later while recovering in a hospital, Jerry begins thinking about moving on to other things after his near death experience. After helping Five-0 with a new case, Jerry ultimately decides to move on from Five-0 and write a book that he no longer wished to put off until it was “too late”. Despite the fact that he no longer appears on the series, the producers have confirmed that he will be appearing in an episode of MacGyver.[26] Tani Rey was first introduced in the season 8 premiere as a lifeguard who was kicked out of the police academy for cheating. Steve asks her to go undercover to assist Five-0 on a case. She originally turned him down. However, she later changed her mind and eventually became an officer on the Five-0 Task Force. It was revealed that she has a delinquent brother named Koa and Tani repeatedly bails him out of trouble, including saving him from an HPD raid moments before he would've been arrested. Despite her best efforts to help him, Koa ends up overdosing and would have died if Adam and Noelani had not intervened. He is sent to rehab to get cleaned up, but decided to stay to work as a counselor. She and Junior Reigns became a couple in Season 10 episode 17. Kamekona Tupuola is the owner of Waiola Shave Ice, Kamekona's Shrimp Truck and Kamekona's Helicopter Tours. Kamekona comes from a typically large Polynesian family and often mentions various relatives whenever one of the members of Five-0 needs a favor, whether for a personal matter or for an investigation. His late cousin, Thomas Hoapili, was a master of Kapu Kuʻialua, an ancient Hawaiian martial art, as is Thomas's daughter, Maggie (portrayed by Summer Glau). Another cousin, Flippa (Shawn Mokuahi Garnett), often helps Kamekona at the shrimp truck.[27] Kamekona was introduced in the Pilot as Chin's confidential informant and owner of a shave ice stall on the beach. His full background and how he first met Chin were only revealed in the season 6 episode \"Kuleana / One's Personal Sense of Responsibility\".[28] As the elder son in an impoverished family, he would skip school to earn extra money to help his single mother. He gradually became a drug kingpin and did some time at Halawa. As a result of his younger brother's involvement with a noted drug dealer, whom Chin Ho Kelly was coincidentally investigating, he agreed to be a CI for the HPD on the condition his brother is let go without any charges. Chin visits Kamekona in prison and gives him Napoleon Hill's book Think and Grow Rich, beginning a friendship that continues to the formation of Five-0. He started his shave ice stand while getting back on his feet after being released. In the season 5 finale, he mentioned that his shrimp truck business is now in doubt, after Steve and Danny dropped a nuke into the sea to prevent it from blowing up on land. In season 3 he qualifies as a helicopter pilot with the help of McGarrett.[29] Members of the Five-0 Task Force and their families are often seen patronizing his shrimp truck or asking him for favors (e.g. he babysat Grace Williams, Danny's daughter, and chaperoned Steve's sister Mary while they were at work). Sergeant Duke Lukela is a veteran HPD officer who often acts as a liaison to Five-0. He was one of the few HPD cops who was not antagonistic towards Danny or the other Five-0 members from the beginning, as he was colleagues with Steve's father and many of Chin and Kono's family members (they come from a family of cops) and had known the three of them since they were children. In \"Hookman\", he was shot by Curt Stoner (Peter Weller), but survived and recovered. He is married to Nalani (portrayed by Chun's real-life partner Laura Mellow.[30])[19] They have a granddaughter. Chun is the son of Kam Fong Chun, who played Chin Ho Kelly on the original Hawaii Five-O.[20] The character Duke Lukela was portrayed by Herman Wedemeyer in the original series. Chun himself also played various minor characters throughout the original series. Noelani was first introduced in season 7 working with Dr. Max Bergman as a medical examiner. Following his departure in season 7 Noelani took his place. She also appeared in numerous episodes of Magnum PI, reluctantly helping the titular character in some of his cases. Junior Reigns was first introduced in the second episode of season 8. Junior came to Steve looking for a job on the Task Force immediately after being discharged from the U.S. Navy. Steve initially turned him. However, after Junior insists, Steve tells him that before becoming a part of Five-0 he must train at the police academy. Junior eventually receives his badge and joins Five-0. Unlike the other members, Junior rarely questions Steve's tactics or methods due to their shared military background as Navy SEALs and has occasionally had to explain to Danny Williams and Lou Grover the rationale behind Steve's actions. Other characters have noted similarities between Steve (when he first started Five-0) and Junior, in particular Junior's instructor at the HPD Academy.[31] In season 8, it is revealed that Junior had been putting up at a homeless shelter despite having family on the island (Steve later finds out and asks him to move in with him until he finds an apartment).[31] Throughout season 9, it is gradually revealed that he has avoided going home as he was estranged from his father and they only communicated through his mother. It has been implied that Junior had grown up in a loving and stable home, unlike some of his peers at school who mixed with the wrong crowd. Junior had initially planned to return to marry his high school sweetheart Layla after a tour but re-enlisted without consulting her, leading to them breaking up.[32] He left the Navy with the rank of Special Warfare Operator 2nd class. Junior had a sister Maya, who was killed in a car accident when he was young, and their father never fully got over it, leading to him vehemently opposing his only remaining child enlisting in the Navy. However Junior went against him and followed his footsteps into the military[33] and it deepened their estrangement to the point where they were no longer on speaking terms for years. When he returned stateside, he attempted to make amends with his father. Their relationship hits a rough patch when Junior decides forgive the man who was driving the car that killed Maya and his grief-stricken father disowns him in the season 9 finale as a result.[34] In season 10 he reaches out to his father again after discovering that his father had actually been regularly communicating with his CO while he was deployed in Afghanistan. At the end of the episode, they reconcile and Junior brings his parents to Steve's Thanksgiving barbecue.[35] He and Tani Rey became a couple in Season 10 episode 17. The following are the awards and decorations worn on SO2 Reigns' Class-A uniform, as seen in \"A'ohe Kio Pohaku Nalo i Ke Alo Pali\". Adam Noshimuri, Kono's husband who becomes a new head of the Japanese Yakuza after Wo Fat murders his father, Hiro. First introduced in the season 2 episode \"Pahele / Trap\", he has been trying to legitimize and clean up his organization with the intention of distancing himself from his father's criminal past. When he and Kono first started dating, the Five-0 team were extremely suspicious of him, particularly Steve and Chin – the former due to his father's history with the yakuza and the latter due to him seeing Kono as a younger sister. He is accepted into the Five-0 ohana after proving his love for Kono. After Adam kills his brother Michael (Daniel Henney) to protect Kono, he and Kono leave Hawaii and go into hiding. He comes out of hiding after his brother's loyalists are no longer a threat. At the beginning of Season 5, Adam proposes to Kono and at the end of this season they marry. In \"Mai ho`oni i ka wai lana mālie\", Adam is shot by Gabriel Waincroft, who runs away with the money that Adam would use to distance himself from the Yakuza. Almost immediately after Adam killed two Yakuza thugs in \"Piko Pau 'iole\" to save himself and Kono, Gabriel buys off Adam's debt in order for his cartel to team up with the head of the Hawaiian Yakuza. He subsequently turns himself in to the Honolulu Police Department. After a short legal battle he is sentenced to 18 months in prison, which was agreed on since he had been acting in self-defense. He has been released on parole as of the season 7 episode \"Ka 'Aelike / The Deal\". Adam is the elder son of Hiro Noshimuri and, with the introduction of Adam's brother Michael, it becomes apparent that Adam was the brains who ran the legitimate business front of their father's operation out of New York while Michael was the brawn who usually took care of the \"dirty\" side. For example, when the Five-0 team uncover a yakuza burial site, it is revealed that he knew nothing about it.[36] He is implied to be a Nisei (first generation American-born Japanese American) and his grandfather served in the Imperial Japanese Navy.[11] Dale was initially confirmed for a four-episode arc but following positive fan response, became a recurring guest star.[37] His character had been written as a potential antagonist for McGarrett and the team as he saw the latter as a stumbling block in his quest for answers about his father's death.[38] Like his character, Dale is of Japanese descent. In the season 8 episode I Ka Wa Ma Mua, I Ka Wa Ma Hope (The Future is in the Past) Danny dreams of the future and Adam has a child with Kono. In the Season 8 episode Ka Hopu Nui 'Ana (The Round Up), after a devastating hit on Hawaii's crime bosses by a new crime syndicate, Steve asks Adam to head up a new special division within the Five-0 Task Force to focus specifically on organized crime. Through his investigation, he discovers he has a half-sister, Noriko, who tries to manipulate him by threatening Kono, Chin, Abby and Sarah. However, Adam ends up leaving the island after his informant, Jessie, is killed, but, at the same time, Noriko is killed. In the season 8 finale, Tani discovers a gun in Adam's house, leading her to believe Adam may have been responsible for Noriko's murder. In the season 9 episode, \"A'ohe Mea 'Imi A Ka Maka\", Tani tests the gun's ballistics and confirm it was the murder weapon. In \"Aia I Hi'Ikua; I Hi'Ialo\", Adam returns home, depressed by his break-up with Kono. However, Danny helps him through his pain and as a thank you for everything he has done, he offers Adam a spot on Five-0 which he accepts. After HPD got an anonymous tip about Adam's gun but was unable to find it, he confronts Tani about it, but she reveals she did not call it in after Adam helped save her brother's life, leading them both to discover a third party is trying to frame him. Quinn Liu first appears as a staff sergeant in the CID who was recently demoted for insubordination the season 10 premiere. Sergeant John McGarrett, HPD (Ret.) (1942–2010) is the father of Steve and Mary Ann McGarrett and (presumed) widower of Doris McGarrett. His own father, Ensign Steve McGarrett, was killed in action on the U.S.S. Arizona (BB-39) during the attack on Pearl Harbor and John was born three months later on March 15. John would follow in his father's footsteps into the navy, serving in the Vietnam War and reaching the rank of Lieutenant before becoming a Honolulu Police Department detective. After Doris' presumed death, he launched his own investigation and sent Steve, then a high school junior, to board at the Army and Navy Academy in Carlsbad, California, and Mary to live with his older sister Deb, who lived several hours away from Steve's new school, for their safety. It is presumed that this was the last time the siblings ever saw him in person as they became estranged from their father for sending them away; Steve only learns the real reason why his father divided the family when he returns to Hawaii to head the new task force following John's murder. In light of the revelation, Steve and Mary were able to let go of their animosity and are often seen visiting his grave site. John has been mentioned a number of times as Steve regularly works with HPD officers, many of whom were John's former colleagues, and is implied to have been a much respected figure within the police force. Even renowned diamond smuggler and fence August March (Ed Asner) paid tribute to John's sense of integrity by telling Steve about how John turned down his $100,000 bribe over three decades ago.[39] John McGarrett was murdered by Victor Hesse on September 20, 2010, as witnessed by Steve, who was overseas on a highly classified mission in South Korea, via satellite phone. He was buried at the National Cemetery of the Pacific with full military honors. In the 100th episode \"Ina Paha\" (\"If Perhaps\") he is never murdered by Hesse and is able to reconnect with Steve when he returns home. Doris McGarrett is the wife of the late John McGarrett and mother of Steve and Mary Ann McGarrett. She was presumably murdered by a car bomb when Steve was aged fifteen or sixteen. It is revealed in Season 3 that she was a former CIA operative who went by the alias \"Shelburne\" and had faked her own death as a cover to escape underground in order to protect her family. In the Season 3 premiere, Joe White brings Steve to Suruga Bay in Japan where mother and son are reunited. Steve was hostile to his mother, even refusing to call her \"Mom\", due to the years of resentment over how the family was torn apart by her supposed death and watching his father grieve over her. Mary also initially refused to see her after learning the truth from Steve. For the rest of the season she constantly refuses to tell everything to Steve and he does not fully trust her. He sends Cath to \"babysit\" her at a safehouse but Wo Fat bypasses the security system and Cath into the house to confront Doris. Despite being a crack shot and armed, ballistic evidence showed that she had intentionally shot away from him, which she attributed to her nerves and shock over Wo Fat's sudden appearance, but Steve refuses to believe her story. In the third-season finale she leaves Hawaii with Kono and Adam to help them evade the Yakuza with her promising to Steve that her story is \"To be continued.\". Over the next two seasons, bits and pieces (and rumors) of Doris' connection to Wo Fat are revealed. Steve only learns the full truth after he was abducted and tortured by Wo Fat in the 100th episode. She is mentioned in the episode \"Pono Kaulike / Justice for All\" where she uses her contacts to keep her son safe from a rogue CIA agent who attempts to have Danny and Chin framed to cover his tracks. Steve was able to use the information she provided to Joe White to exonerate his co-workers. In the seventh seasons 150th episode Steve learns from Catherine that she was captured after attempting to break Wo Fat's father out of prison. Steve and Catherine along with the rest of the team (excluding Danny) go to Morocco to break her and Wo Fat's father out. Later Doris is seen again in Season 10 Episode 7 where she is reunited briefly with Steve for a little before she is stabbed and dies. Debra \"Deb\" McGarrett is the late older sister of John McGarrett and aunt of Steve and Mary Ann McGarrett. She raised Mary when John had sent the kids away from Hawaii for their safety after Doris was presumed to be murdered by a car bomb. Steve and Mary both see her as a maternal figure and she, having never married or had children, treats them as her own. Deb had been a struggling singer on the cusp of a big break when she left a promising career to raise Mary. In season 4, she pays Steve a surprise visit for Thanksgiving and reveals that she has stage four cancer. In season 5, she agrees to go for chemotherapy and her brain tumor has shrunk. She marries Leonard Cassano (Frankie Valli), a retired defense lawyer with stage four leukemia whom met during chemo. In the episode \"Ua Ola Loko I Ke Aloha / Love Gives Life Within\" she returns to Hawaii with Leonard's ashes on the pretext of spending time with Steve, Mary, and Joan, but does not tell them that she was actually dying and trying to complete her bucket list. She passes away peacefully in Steve and Mary's childhood home (which Steve has lived in since his father's death) after fulfilling all but one thing on her bucket list—climb a tall mountain. Steve and Mary complete her list by scattering her ashes on the mountain top. Grace Williams is the daughter of Danny Williams and Rachel Edwards. Her parents divorced in the timeline before the pilot and she moved to Hawaii with her mother and millionaire new stepfather. She attends the Academy of the Sacred Heart, a fictional private school, and participates in the cheerleading team. She calls her father \"Danno\" and is the only person he unconditionally allows to call him that; McGarrett would mock Danny using the nickname or with the tagline \"Book 'em, Danno\", much to Danny's exasperation. Grace is named after a former partner of her father's who was killed in the line of duty by a criminal. Grace is well-liked by the rest of the Five-0 ohana. She took to \"Uncle Steve\", as she calls McGarrett, who affectionately calls her \"Gracie\". Whenever Danny was unavailable due to extenuating circumstances, McGarrett would be the one to pick her up from school or personally reassure her. Grace was often the source of Danny's disputes with his ex-wife over his visitation rights. Rachel would use their daughter as leverage and make empty threats about rescinding or lessening his visitation days. Eventually, Danny takes the matter to court and is awarded joint custody, meaning that Grace cannot move away from Hawaii without Danny's approval. As of season 7 Grace is dating Will Grover, Lou's son. In the season 8 episode \"I Ka Wa Ma Mua, I Ka Wa Ma Hope\" (\"The Future is in the Past\") Grace is shown as an adult marrying Will. Charlie is the second child of Danny and Rachel. Charlie was originally thought to be the son of Stan however it was revealed in season 5 that Danny is the true father. In the season 8 episode I Ka Wa Ma Mua, I Ka Wa Ma Hope (The Future is in the Past) Charlie is an adult and has become a member of the Honolulu Police Department. He is then offered a job by Tani Rey, the now leader of the Five-0 Task Force. Will Grover is the son of Lou Grover. Although not seen until season 6 he moved to Hawaii with his father, mother, and sister. He attends Academy of the Sacred Heart with Grace Williams. Will and Grace are often seen spending time together doing activities such as homework, eating breakfast, and dancing. As of season 7 Will is dating Grace. In the season 8 episode I Ka Wa Ma Mua, I Ka Wa Ma Hope (The Future is in the Past) an adult Will is marrying Grace. Danny's ex-wife and mother of Grace and Charlie. She moves to Hawaii after marrying millionaire Stan Edwards. Early in Season 1, she and Danny are often seen bitterly arguing on the phone to the point where the whole team knew about the feud even before they had met Rachel or Grace in person. She often used Grace as leverage and threatened to further limit his visitation rights when his job prevented him from being punctual to their father-daughter dates but Danny successfully files for joint custody, meaning that Grace cannot leave Hawaii without his consent. They are now on friendly terms, particularly after her marriage with Stan hits a rocky patch and Danny was there to help with Charlie's birth (which he later discovers was actually his, not Stan's). In the seventh season of the series Rachel divorces Stan and takes her maiden name once again. Later in seasons 8 and 9, Rachel and Danny reconcile. In season 10, Danny says reconciliation did not go well. Chin's wife, Dr. Malia Waincroft was previously engaged to Chin before he broke up with her after losing his badge. The two reconnected after he joined Five-0, and then resumed their relationship. She marries Kelly in the episode \"Alaheo Pauʻole / Gone Forever\", but dies in \"La O Na Makuahine\", the third-season premiere episode, from injuries sustained after she was shot, leaving Chin devastated. She had a brother named Gabriel Waincroft who was revealed to be responsible for the murder of Chin's father 15 years earlier. Lynn Downey is seen dating Steve McGarrett in season 6 and season 7. They are presumedly still together through season 8, as per comments early in the season. The cause of their break up is not known nor is it made clear when it happened. Jenna Kaye is an ex-CIA analyst, assistant to Five-0. She is later revealed to be an associate of Wo Fat. At the end of \"Ha'i'ole\", she is seen driving Wo Fat away from the prison after he murdered Victor Hesse. She leaves Five-0 to follow up on a lead that her fiancé, Josh, who she claimed had been killed by Wo Fat, might in fact be alive and asks Steve to go with her to North Korea to get him. It turns out to be a trap for McGarrett, from Wo Fat telling Jenna he would release Josh if she brought him McGarrett, explaining her association with him. Jenna later discovers that Josh had been dead the entire time and that it was also a trap for her. She is able to tell McGarrett she is sorry for setting him up and gives him a pin from Josh's knee repair to help him escape, moments before Wo Fat shoots and kills her. In the 100th episode she is seen in the same episode that Victor Hesse is in looking for her fiancé who was in a motorcycle accident. Abby Dunn is a Detective for the HPD and is the girlfriend of Chin Ho Kelly. She held the rank of Inspector at the San Francisco Police Department and was temporarily assigned to the Five-0 task force as SFPD intended to start a similar task force. However, it is revealed that she had been forced by an FBI agent with a grudge against Five-0 to tail them and find a reason to shut the task force down. She discloses this information to Chin after starting a relationship with him and resigns from the SFPD as well as Five-0, transferring to the HPD to become a detective. Pat Jameson was the Governor of Hawaii in Season 1. When Steve McGarrett returned home to Hawaii to bury his father, who was murdered by arms dealer Victor Hesse, she requests him to set up a task force with \"full immunity and means\" to apprehend criminals such as Hesse. McGarrett flatly turns her down as he felt she only asked him to do so for political reasons and boost her ratings. Once he realizes he had no jurisdiction over the investigation, he quickly accepts the job and sets the \"Governor's Task Force\", which came to be called \"Five-0\". Over the course of season 1 it is revealed that Governor Jameson was actually colluding with Wo Fat and other criminals such as Adam's father Hiro. In the season 1 finale it is revealed that she was responsible for the murder of Laura Hills. McGarrett confronts her about it in her office and records her confession on his phone. Wo Fat sneaks in, tasers McGarrett and then shoots and kills the governor after she deletes the recording. Wo Fat attempts to frame McGarrett for the murder by placing the murder weapon in his hand. Laura Hills, Gov. Jameson's public safety liaison. In the season 1 finale it is revealed that she was sending McGarett evidence from his \"Champ\" box. She is killed in a car bomb by Wo Fat and Jameson. McGarrett is also framed for her murder after his fingerprints were found in her house. Michael Noshimuri is Adam's brother who was released from prison during season three, and appears apprehensive about any plans to remake the Yakuza. He attempted to frame Kono for a murder he committed using her gun. In the season three finale, he attempts to kill his brother Adam and Adam's girlfriend Kono, but Adam kills him in self-defense. Lieutenant Commander Joe White, USN (Ret.) (born July 9, 1954[40]) was Steve McGarrett's former SEAL trainer and a long-time friend of John McGarrett and mentor to Steve. A Wisconsin native,[40] he is a \"mustang\", having been a master chief petty officer before gaining a commission and retiring as a lieutenant commander. He appears to be well known amongst SEALs from his time as a trainer at the Naval Special Warfare Center, as McGarrett's former SEAL teammate Billy Harrington and SO2 Graham Wilson, who was a person of interest in the episode \"Hoʻapono\", both knew of him. In the season 2 episode \"Kiʻilua / Deceiver\", he is forced into retirement after leading an unsanctioned mission into North Korea to rescue McGarrett. White was one of the few people who knew about Shelburne but he refused to disclose it to McGarrett as he knew it would only hurt him even more emotionally. He would repeatedly give excuses or evade McGarrett's persistent questions about the true identity of Shelburne. As a result, McGarrett, despite seeing him as a father figure, regards him with some distrust. Joe was killed in season 9, because of Greer's treason (Steve's ex lover). Mamo owns a surf rental shop at Waikiki Beach. During the off season he works as a bus driver.[41] A long-time friend of McGarrett's father and Chin and Kono's family, he taught Steve, Mary, and Kono how to surf as children and is seen as a fatherly figure by them. He is also a history enthusiast and participates in historical reenactments of Ancient Hawaiian society.[42] Al Harrington is one of several actors who appeared on the original series. He had a recurring role as Detective Ben Kokua.[20] Governor Samuel \"Sam\" Denning was Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii, replacing Gov. Jameson after her death. He is much more \"by the book\" and withdraws his predecessor's assurance to the Five-0 Task Force of \"full immunity and means\". Instead, he brings in former federal agent Lori Weston as a \"spy\" to keep McGarrett and the rest of Five-0 in line, much to their displeasure. In season 3 he and McGarrett come to a mutual agreement to be open with one another about investigations, with McGarrett pointing out that Governor Jameson's dishonesty was what got her killed. Although not always agreeing with McGarrett's style, Governor Denning does vouch for and backs him when necessary. For example, he dismisses Lou Grover's complaint against McGarrett in season 4 and instead forces the both of them to serve a warrant together and work out their differences themselves. In the episode \"Poina ʻOle / Not Forgotten\", Nahele was first introduced as a homeless juvenile delinquent who stole McGarrett's prized vintage Marquis and stripped it for scrap metal. McGarrett decides not to file charges after learning that Nahele was living on the streets after running away from his temporary guardian, his negligent uncle, and that his only parent, his father, has been in prison since he was eight. Kamekona agrees to let Nahele work for him as a waiter at the shrimp truck as part of the agreement that McGarrett will not file charges if Nahele keeps his end of the bargain to stay out of trouble. Since then he has looked up to McGarrett as a mentor and an older brother figure. In season 6, his father is released from prison and successfully files for custody of him. Distraught, Nahele confesses a long-buried secret to McGarrett explaining why he still refuses to see his father even though the latter turned his life around. Charlie Fong is a forensic scientist with the Honolulu Police Department Crime Lab. He provides evidence analysis for the Five-0 Task Force. He attended the prestigious Punahou School and is a childhood friend of Kono. Ellie Clayton is a lawyer and Deputy District Attorney introduced in the season 5 episode \"Hoʻoilina / Legacy\". She emigrated from Australia with her father Paul as a child. Her father owned a bar called \"Aces High\" but was shot and killed in a botched robbery nineteen years ago. She was upstairs in their flat and heard the kill shot. A homeless man was prosecuted but the case eventually went cold due to the lack of credible witnesses and evidence. She graduated from law school and returned to Hawaii. In several episodes she aided the Five-0 Task Force by securing arrest warrants or providing advice. McGarrett meets her by chance when he sees her putting flowers on his father's grave and accosts her. She reveals that John was the uniformed officer who responded to the scene of her father's murder. Every Christmas since then he would visit her and give her a present. According to Chin, John made an effort to keep in contact with her, partly out of guilt and regret for sending his two children away. Ellie reveals that prior to his death, John had called her up to tell her that he had found new evidence. McGarrett recalls finding an \"Aces High\" matchbook in his father's Champ toolbox and decides to reopen the case in memory of his father. Five-0 solves the case with the help of a young drug runner whom Paul had tried to help back then (unsuccessfully) and wanted to repay Paul for his kindness. Danny proposed Ellie as a potential love interest, but McGarrett quickly shoots down the idea, saying that due to her connection to his father, they could only be friends. She tries to set a reluctant McGarrett up with various women out of concern that he was too consumed with his work. McGarrett eventually begins a relationship with one of the women, Lynn. Eric Russo (born 1984 or 1985[13]) is the nephew of Detective Danny Williams; his mother Stella is Danny's older sister. He was first introduced in the episode \"Kapu / Forbidden\" when Stella sends him to his \"Uncle D\" in hopes that Danny would be able to set him straight. He dropped out of college and was still undecided about his future. In the episode, he follows McGarrett and the team around as they solve a case involving a college professor and his students.

Wo Fat (portrayed by Mark Dacascos) is the principal antagonist and nemesis of Steve McGarrett. He is well known in the criminal world for his ruthlessness and ability to wriggle his way around the law. Wo Fat debuted in the last scene of the first-season episode \"Hana 'a'a Makehewa\" on December 13, 2010. In the episode, Wo Fat pays Victor Hesse a visit in jail and asks about Steve McGarrett's (Alex O'Loughlin) pursuit of justice for his father John (William Sadler), whom Hesse killed in the pilot episode. Over the course of the season, Wo Fat attracts McGarrett's attention because of his association with local Yakuza boss Hiro Noshimuri. It is revealed that Wo Fat ordered the death of the elder McGarrett and frames Steve in the season finale for killing Governor Jameson (who was in collusion with him). As the second season begins, Wo Fat orders Hesse to kill McGarrett behind bars and kills Hesse to prevent Five-0 from getting more answers about him. He is also in cahoots with ex–CIA analyst Jenna Kaye, whose fiancé was captured in an earlier mission to take down Wo Fat. This allows him to manipulate Kaye in getting Steve's help for a fake ransom exchange in North Korea. He kills her and disappears as Five-0 rescues Steve. It is revealed that Wo Fat is obsessed with finding and killing a person named \"Shelburne\", who apparently killed his father years before the series. As Wo Fat hides in Osaka, late in the season, McGarrett captures him and brings him back to Hawaii. However, both men are forced to work together in fighting off Hiro's son and successor Adam, who was seeking revenge for his father's death. McGarrett locks him up at the Halawa Correctional Facility at the end of the season. As the third season begins, \"In La O Na Makuahine\", Wo Fat is on the verge of being transferred but the prison truck he is in is attacked. The truck is then transported by a helicopter and dropped into the ocean. Armed men in SCUBA cut through the truck's secure door with torches and kill the guards, resulting in Fat being freed. It is later revealed that Frank Delano is the man responsible for attacking the truck and breaking Wo Fat out. The two strike up a deal; Delano will be able to get stolen drugs off the island in exchange for giving Wo Fat the location of Shelburne, who happens to be Doris McGarrett, Steve's supposedly dead mother. Wo Fat eventually confronts Doris in Steve's home and the two engage in a stand-off, holding each other at gunpoint. However, Doris fires three shots into the ground, giving Wo Fat time to escape although it's not known the extent of the relationship Doris has with Wo Fat. In \"Hana I Wa 'I\", Wo Fat kidnaps a congressman and is about to kill him until a helicopter manned by Steve with Danny firing arrives on scene. Wo Fat exchanges gunfire with Danny before fleeing yet again. In \"Imi Loko Ka 'Uhane\", Wo Fat returns, disguised as a police officer, and when reporter Savannah Walker interviews him during the show she videotaped about Five-0, McGarrett notices Wo Fat and started to shoot him but he got away. Later in the episode, Five-0 tracks him to the jungle where he gets severely injured when the helicopter he tries to escape in gets shot down. McGarrett refuses to kill him and instead sends him to the hospital with police guarding the hospital, where he is bandaged and handcuffed to the bed. In \"Aloha, Malama Pono\", Wo Fat is seen lying in a bed in a high risk detention facility at an unknown location with Steve standing in the room, staring at him. At the end of the episode, McGarrett pays him another visit and wants to know why his mother came to see him. Wo Fat agrees to tell him, but first McGarrett has to get Fat out of the jail. Then they both hear an explosion. Fat tells Steve that he is his protection because the unknown forces currently breaking down the door are not here to rescue him, but want him dead. As the fourth season begins, \"In Aloha kekahi i kekahi\", NLM terrorists attempt to kill Wo Fat but McGarrett saves him. Before Wo Fat is transferred to a Supermax facility in Colorado, McGarrett wants an answer from Wo Fat why Doris visited him. Fat says she wanted to apologize to him for killing his father. In \"O ka Pili'Ohana ka 'Oi\", he is given medication in his solitary confinement cell by an officer for his heart condition. He is asked to swallow the medication and open his mouth so that it is certain he ingested it. Wo Fat hides the pills well in his mouth and reaches inside his toilet to reveal that this is not the first time he has faked it. He then uses the medication along with paint thinner and fertilizer from the jail, to craft an explosion to take out a wall in his cell to escape. He is positively ID'd at a gas station near Colorado Springs, pouring gasoline on someone, lighting them on fire, then stealing their truck to head back to Oahu. After Grover's daughter Samantha is freed from Ian Wright's capture, she tells everyone that a man, revealed to be Wo Fat, killed Ian and released her. McGarrett is given a message from Samantha that Wo Fat will see him soon. In the 100th episode, \"Ina Paha\", Wo Fat abducts Steve and tortures him in order to try to learn where he believes the U.S. government is holding his father. During the torture, he tells Steve that Doris had adopted him from the streets after her op went bad and his mother was killed. Doris raised him for some time before she was forced by the CIA to abandon him. After a long fight, Steve kills Wo Fat. His last words were, \"You're not going to kill me. Are you... Brother?\" Victor and Anton Hesse (James Marsters and Norman Reedus) are brothers and criminals heavily involved in the illegal arms trafficking trade. During his days as a SEAL, McGarrett was part of a task force which had been investigating and tracking the Hesse brothers for several years. He and his buddy Freddie Hart were sent into North Korea on a classified operation to kidnap Anton Hesse but Hart was killed and Anton was eventually killed when the convoy he and McGarrett were being transported in was attacked. In the pilot, McGarrett personally shoots Victor Hesse but his body was never found. Victor later resurfaces and is eventually caught and sent to prison where he is killed by Wo Fat who was posing as a corrections officer. Gabriel Waincroft (Christopher Sean) is the younger brother of Malia Waincroft, the late wife of Chin Ho Kelly. As an adolescent he repeatedly got into trouble with the law and Malia went to Chin, then her boyfriend, for help in setting him straight. Gabriel was initiated into a gang after killing Chin's father and rose through the ranks of the (fictional) Culiacan cartel based in Sinaloa, Mexico.[43] With Wo Fat's death, Waincroft is now the team's primary antagonist. He has been described as daring and ambitious, particularly after he had his men attempt to assassinate the heads of three different criminal syndicates during a high-profile boxing match (the attempt was discreetly foiled by Five-0), in the episode \"Ka Makau kaa kaua / The Sweet Science\". In \"Pa'a Ka 'ipuka I Ka 'Upena Nananana\", he was badly wounded and died in surgery from cardiac arrest. His daughter Sarah is currently being cared for by Chin as her legal guardian.

The team generally tolerate him as he does provide valuable and much-needed intel for the team on several occasions. Adam \"Toast\" Charles (Martin Starr) is one of Danny Williams' CIs. He is a highly skilled hacker who sometimes helps the Five-0 team with cases related to the cyber-crime underworld that require a more underhanded approach.

Detective Kaleo (Jason Scott Lee) is a corrupt former Honolulu Police Department cop who was imprisoned for his involvement in the murder of fellow cop Detective Meka Hanamoa, who was the partner of Detective Danny Williams when the latter first joined the HPD. He was initially housed in protective custody due to his former occupation but was sent to \"general population\" after he aided his brother Daryl in the trafficking of conflict diamonds, indirectly causing McGarrett's sister to be coerced into becoming a mule.[39] His brother is killed in Season 2 and Kaleo is finally killed in Season 3 by Chin Ho Kelly when he tries to kill him. Frank Delano (William Baldwin) is a corrupt former HPD homicide detective who founded his own criminal syndicate composed exclusively of former cops. After Kono was \"fired\", Delano recruited her into the syndicate. Unbeknownst to him, it was part of Captain Fryer's plot to arrest Delano and his associates. Delano was killed by Chin after Five-0 cornered him and his crew in the season 3 premiere. His brother Paul (portrayed by William Baldwin's real-life brother Daniel) later seeks revenge by drugging and kidnapping Chin. Gerard Hirsch (Willie Garson) is a known conman who did time in Halawa after being arrested in the episode \"Uaʻaihue\" for stealing a Van Gogh painting and for forgery. The team encounter him again in season 6 during an investigation into a case involving a dead counterfeiter and his stash of counterfeit hundred-dollar bills found on several murder victims. Hirsch currently runs his own crime scene clean-up company as part of his plan to \"reform\" and live an honest life. His expertise as a highly skilled former forger and extensive knowledge of art history have come into handy at times.

It is later revealed that Wright was the mastermind behind the robberies and escapes before he can be arrested. He later reappears, kidnapping Samantha Grover to blackmail Grover into providing a group of mercenaries SWAT gear to commit a robbery of $100 million. He is unable to get his hands on the money as he is killed by Wo Fat, who escaped from his SuperMax prison and released Samantha to send McGarrett a message.
