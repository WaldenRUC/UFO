German airline Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525, which he's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the French Alps. Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a \"previous episode of severe depression,\" the airline said Tuesday. Email correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation, Lufthansa said, included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training. The announcement indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz's battle with depression, allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit. Lufthansa, whose CEO Carsten Spohr previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a \"swift and seamless clarification\" and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors. Spohr traveled to the crash site Wednesday, where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside. He saw the crisis center set up in Seyne-les-Alpes, laid a wreath in the village of Le Vernet, closer to the crash site, where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial. Menichini told CNN late Tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching. French President Francois Hollande, speaking Tuesday, said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week, sooner than authorities had previously suggested. In the meantime, the recovery of the victims' personal belongings will start Wednesday, Menichini said. Among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board. Check out the latest from our correspondents. The details about Lubitz's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz's possible motive for downing the jet. A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that Lubitz had a valid medical certificate, had passed all his examinations and \"held all the licenses required.\" Earlier, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf, Christoph Kumpa, said medical records reveal Lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot's license. Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash. Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license, a European government official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Tuesday. While flying was \"a big part of his life,\" the source said, it's only one theory being considered. Another source, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, also told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems. Lubitz's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist, both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues, the European government official said. But no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles, there's more to the story, said Brian Russell, a forensic psychologist. \"Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they weren't going to keep doing their job and they're upset about that and so they're suicidal,\" he said. \"But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person's problems.\" Germanwings crash compensation: What we know.

Prosecutors: Co-pilot suicidal at one time Check out the latest from our correspondents Who was the captain of Germanwings Flight 9525? Meanwhile, French investigative newspaper Le Canard Enchaine reported Wednesday that the Gendarmerie Nationale, or National Police, had questioned Remy Jouty, the head of the BEA, regarding leaks in the investigation – specifically a report in The New York Times about the contents of the cockpit voice recorder. BEA spokeswoman Martine Del Bono confirmed to CNN that the Gendarmerie Nationale questioned Jouty regarding the Germanwings investigation but refused to elaborate. She said he was questioned on the evening of March 25. That same day, The New York Times reported that the Germanwings pilot was locked out of the cockpit just before the crash. “An investigator said evidence from a cockpit voice recorder indicated one pilot left the cockpit before the plane’s descent and was unable to get back in,” reporter Nicola Clark wrote. Wednesday’s article in Le Canard Enchainé, citing a government source, said: “They (the Gendarmerie) reproached him (Jouty) for not informing the Prosecutor first regarding the content of the cockpit voice recorder. “The Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, in charge of the investigation and the Gendarmerie found out about the cockpit voice recorder content in … the press!” said Le Canard Enchainé. Separately, the French National Union of Airline Pilots confirmed that it had filed a complaint against a person it identified merely as “X” last week for breach of confidentiality after “a source close to the investigation” leaked information to The New York Times. “The article states that the source is a high official part of the team of investigators and that he had access to audio recordings from the recorder,” the union’s statement said. The union said information taken from the recording was “communicated to the press before it was given to the judicial inquiry and especially families.” It claimed European rules had been violated by those who had access to the recordings.

He first took to the skies as a member of a gliding club in his hometown of Montabaur in west Germany before fulfilling his ambition of becoming a professional pilot. Friends and neighbours described him as a \"quiet\" but \"fun\" character, who enjoyed his job. A picture from his now defunct Facebook page shows him smiling happily in front of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In the aftermath of the disaster, investigators have established a very different side to his character. Police found torn-up sick notes in his homes, including one covering the day of the crash. Despite assertions from friends that he was in good spirits, the final report on the crash by French investigators found he had suffered from a psychiatric condition and had been taking medication before the crash. Fearing he was losing his vision, he had hidden the evidence from his employer. The Bild newspaper also reported that he may have been going through a \"personal life crisis\" at the time of the crash. Lsubitz lived at his parents' home in Montabaur, a town near Frankfurt of about 12,500 people. His father Guenther worked in banking and his mother was a church organist. He was about 14 when he joined the LSC Westerwald glider club in Montabaur, where he learned to fly in a sleek white ASK-21 two-seater and went on to obtain his full licence, according to club chairman Klaus Radke. He was also a keen runner, competing in several races. In 2007, he graduated from high school and was accepted as a Lufthansa trainee the following year, enrolling at the company's training school in Bremen. Lubitz had a break in training about six years ago, lasting several months, according to Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr. Mr Spohr refused to disclose the reason for this gap but said his suitability had been reassessed and Lubitz had resumed his studies. But the final report of the investigation into the crash finds the interruption was caused by medical problems. He suffered a serious depressive episode during his treatment and went on to receive treatment for a year and a half. During that time, he considered suicide but was eventually declared healthy. It was recommended by a doctor that he needed special regular medical inspection and his medical certificates were valid for only one year at a time. A relevant note was added to his aviation authority file as well as to his pilot's licence. In 2013 he joined Lufthansa's low budget airline, Germanwings. He initially worked as a flight attendant before starting his role as co-pilot. His duties would have included monitoring instruments, communicating with air traffic controllers and sharing control of the aircraft with the captain. He would have also been expected to steer the plane during the pilot's breaks, or if he or she became ill. Lufthansa said Lubitz had flown a total of 630 hours before the fatal crash. He underwent a regular security check on 27 January and nothing untoward was found. Previous security checks in 2008 and 2010 also showed no issues. \"He was 100% fit to fly without any restrictions or conditions,\" Mr Spohr said. Yet the crash investigation found differently. He had battled with vision problems and insomnia for several months, it said, caused by a psychiatric disorder rather than anything physical. He was taking medication for both psychiatric issues and insomnia, and had been given doctor's notes excusing him from work. But he never showed them to the airline. \"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode and was taking psychotropic medication,\" the report found. \"This made him unfit to fly.\" But the report found he had hidden the evidence, and neither the airline nor his colleagues could have known about his circumstances. Those who knew Lubitz have described him as an affable young man, who gave no indications he was harbouring any harmful intent. This video can not be played Members of the flight club where Andreas Lubitz was a member have been talking about his personality Klaus Radke told the Associated Press that he had seen him when he returned to the club to renew his glider licence in the autumn of 2014. \"He seemed very enthusiastic about his career,\" he said. \"I can't remember anything where something wasn't right.\" Peter Ruecker, a long-time member of club, also insisted Lubitz had seemed \"very happy\" during their last meeting. \"I'm just speechless,\" he said. \"I don't have any explanation for this. Knowing Andreas, this is just inconceivable for me.\" A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet. Guenther Lubitz, the killer's father, rejected the findings as \"false\", arguing that they were not thorough enough. He and his wife placed a loving tribute to their son in a local newspaper to mark the first anniversary of the crash, angering families of the victims, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports.

The discovery of the bodies came about 24 hours after the blast brought down the four-storey building in the Mediterranean port city in southern France. Emergency workers had continued rescue operations through Sunday night into the early hours of Monday with the help of a crane and lights, but a persistent fire underneath the rubble hampered their work, making it difficult for firefighters to deploy sniffer dogs. “Given the particular difficulties of intervention, the extraction [of the bodies from the site] will take time,” the fire department said in a statement announcing the bodies had been found. “The judicial authority will then proceed to identify” the victims, it added. Earlier on Sunday, before the discovery of the bodies, local prosecutor Dominique Laurens said eight people “were not responding to phone calls”. Five people from neighbouring buildings sustained minor injuries in the blast and collapse, which occurred abot 1.40am on Sunday local time. “Tonight, the pain and sorrow are great,” Marseille’s mayor, Benoit Payan, said in a statement. “All services of the city, as well as the state, are still at this very moment fully committed to continue the search.” The cause of the explosion is still to be determined, but investigators are looking at the possibility it was the result of a gas leak. More than 100 firefighters were battling the blaze in the ruins of the building, which was believed to have one apartment on each floor. “We have nothing, not even an ID card. We have lost everything,” said a man who gave his name as Roland in an interview with local newspaper La Provence. He managed to get out of the building on 15 Rue de Tivoli with his wife and two children before it collapsed, together with a neighbouring building, after the explosion around 12.40am local time. A third building partly collapsed. Five people were taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. The interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, who visited the site, said 30 buildings in the area were evacuated. Saveria Mosnier, who lives in a street near the site in the La Plaine neighbourhood, said: “I was sleeping and there was this huge blast that really shook the room. I was shocked awake as if I had been dreaming. “We very quickly smelled a strong gas odour that hung around. We could still smell it this morning.” It was unclear how many people were inside the collapsed buildings . “Not all the people who were supposedly inside … have been seen. Families are worried,” the French housing minister, Olivier Klein, told the broadcaster Franceinfo. Christophe Mirmand, the prefect of the southern Bouches-du-Rhône region, said: “We have to be very cautious about what the cause was at this stage.” Gas was “one possible option”. Gilles, who lives on a sidestreet near the building, told AFP the sound of the crash “was huge”. “It sounded like an explosion,” he said, declining to provide his last name. Almost 200 residents were evacuated and 50 requested to be urgently rehoused. An aid centre for people looking for missing family members or loved ones has been opened in a neighbouring district. Eight were killed in Marseille in 2018 when two dilapidated buildings in the working-class district of Noailles caved in. It cast a harsh light on the city’s housing standards, with aid groups saying 40,000 people live in shoddy structures. But authorities appeared to rule out structural issues in the latest collapse, in a neighbourhood known for its bars and nightlife. “There was no danger notice for this building, and it is not in a neighbourhood identified as having substandard housing,” said Mirmand. Further back in Marseille’s history, eight people were killed in a building collapse in 1981, five in an explosion in 1985, and four in a 1996 gas blast that demolished a seven-storey building. Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report", "We know that Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 was flown into a mountain by co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 27, after he locked the plane's pilot out of the cockpit. A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet. The final accident report by the French authorities answered many questions - but some are still a mystery. Investigators ruled out terrorism early on and their position did not change when it was revealed that they believed Lubitz had deliberately crashed the aircraft. That was upheld in the final report, which found that he had been suffering from psychiatric issues he had hidden from his colleagues. The co-pilot did not behave in a peculiar or extreme manner and people who knew him expressed shock over the event. \"He's not the type of guy who would try and kill other people - absolutely not,\" a neighbour said. \"He was really just a very normal, not very remarkable, nice young man,\" said Klaus Radke, the president of the club near Montabaur in Germany where Lubitz had learned to fly. Lubitz had battled depression before, suspending his training for medical reasons in 2008. The final crash investigation report detailed his medical history and showed he had started to suffer from a \"severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms\". During that period, he considered suicide and \"made several 'no suicide pacts' with his treating psychiatrist and was hospitalised\", the report says. In April 2009, his medical certificate was not revalidated \"due to depression and the taking of medication to treat it\". In July that year, he was declared \"entirely healthy\" and given a one-year medical certificate, with a note that it must be renewed each year. It was renewed annually without incident until December 2014. It was then that Lubitz consulted doctors about \"vision problems and sleep disorders\" but eye specialists could not find a physical cause. Instead, investigators say, he was diagnosed with a \"psychosomatic disorder\" - a physical illness caused by a mental factor. In February 2015, he was given a sick certificate for eight days, which he did not forward to the airline. Over the next month, he would be issued several more medical certificates, none of which his employer saw; was prescribed insomnia and antidepressant medication; and was referred \"for psychiatric hospital treatment due to a possible psychosis\". Traces of the medications were found in his remains during a post-mortem toxicology exam. \"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode, and was taking psychotropic medication,\" the report found. \"This made him unfit to fly.\" Prosecutors in Duesseldorf at the time of the crash found torn-up sick notes, including for the day of the crash. In April 2015, German prosecutors said Lubitz had researched \"ways to commit suicide\" on his tablet at home in the week before the crash. Another of his internet searches was for \"cockpit doors and their security provisions\". The German tabloid paper Bild said (in German) it had seen documents that said he was suffering from a \"personal life crisis\", having recently broken up with a girlfriend. But even when we have a fuller picture of Lubitz's state of mind before the crash, some of his actions may remain a mystery forever. For example, after he had decided to kill himself and everyone else on board the plane, why did he set the aircraft on a controlled, rather than a sudden, descent? Depression is a serious illness, and it affects everyone differently. People experiencing depression can reach such a state of alienation that they risk taking their lives - but the vast majority of people with depression would never harm anyone other than themselves. Writing in the Times, Jennifer Wild, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, has said that the irrational thinking evident from Lubitz's actions in the cockpit may have been triggered by depression, possibly caused by a recent traumatic episode. \"Perhaps in his state he did not consider the consequences of his actions, or perhaps he did not care because he was consumed with ending his life,\" she wrote, adding that drug-taking or a bout of extreme anger might also explain his actions. The black box recording of Lubitz's calm breathing as he pressed the controls to send the aeroplane hurtling to the ground may lead some to believe he was a psychopath but Dr Wild notes that psychopaths generally avoid harming themselves. Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that millions of people in Britain suffered from depression, which is a treatable illness. He told the BBC that this included pilots who \"resume flying, perfectly safely, for maybe tens of years afterwards\". The fact that Lubitz appears to have been signed off as sick raises the question of whether there was - or should have been - contact between his doctors and the airline. Medical practitioners take an oath to maintain patient confidentiality but some US states have expanded doctors' duty of care to the community at large. This allows them to warn third parties if they think it necessary. In Germany, trainee pilots are subjected to medical examinations which include oral psychological assessments. There is some debate as to whether such assessments are thorough enough. One question an examiner might ask a pilot is, \"Do you have a butterfly collection at home?\", the Suddeitsche Zeitung reported (in German). At the time of the crash, Lufthansa said that after they hired pilots they did not subject them to regular psychological examinations. This is obligatory in other countries, such as the US and UK. Airline staff are encouraged to report strange behaviour on the part of their colleagues but a former pilot told the BBC that peer pressure could act as a brake on this process. And Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa's chief, admitted: \"All the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case.\" But Mr Spohr also said: \"No matter your safety regulations, no matter how high you set the bar, and we have incredibly high standards, there is no way to rule out such an event. This is an awful one-off event.\" Aircraft-assisted pilot suicides are rare. A 2014 study by the Federal Aviation Authority identified eight such instances in the US between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 0.29% of all fatal aviation aircraft accidents. All the pilots involved had been medically screened and none had demonstrated mental disorder, depression or suicidal thoughts. Some people are asking why there is no system for wresting control of a plane from a control tower. In fact, such a system does exist, reports the Daily Mail, but it is not being used. In 2006, Boeing was awarded a patent for an \"uninterrupted autopilot system\" with its own power supply that could be activated by those on board a plane or on the ground. However, safety concerns - including the possibility that such a system could be hacked - have prevented its roll-out. The crash also raises questions about the cockpit door mechanism which Lubitz used to keep the pilot out. The system, which allows a pilot to override the coded entry mechanism on the outside of the door, was designed in the event of a terrorist emergency. Airlines are going to have to balance those concerns against the possibility that individuals like Lubitz might decide to do harm, said the BBC's transport correspondent Richard Westcott. Lubitz was able to fly the plane into the ground without interruption since he seized the opportunity to lock the cockpit doors while the plane's pilot was going to the toilet. Some airlines enforce a \"rule of two\" - that there should never be fewer than two people left in the cockpit. For these airlines, a member of the cabin crew enters the cockpit when appropriate to ensure this rule is followed. After the Germanwings crash, several airlines, including Lufthansa, announced they were adopting this rule. The European Aviation Safety Agency has recommended that at least two people be present in the cockpit at all times. China's aviation authority has also introduced the rule and the UK's Civil Aviation Authority has contacted all UK airlines \"to require them to review all relevant procedures\". What relatives of plane crash victims need most are answers, experts say. But the more we learn about Lubitz, the more heartbreaking the Germanwings crash seems. Evidence from research suggests that trauma inflicted by other humans on purpose is more difficult to come to terms with than natural disasters, clinical psychologist Roderick Orner told the BBC. Acts of violence are also harder to process than accidents due to negligence or mechanical failure. \"Violence is often experienced as an attack on human integrity,\" says psychiatrist Lars Weiseth. \"This aspect causes increasing anger, loss of trust in companies and people, and sharply increases the risk to mental health.\" The fact that Lubitz seemingly had no agenda for his actions does not necessarily make things easier, since the deaths could seem meaningless. If he had been a terrorist, Prof Weiseth says, relatives might be able to see their family members as \"involuntary participants in an important struggle for democratic values\".

Authorities said on Monday that Lubitz was once documented as having suicidal tendencies. Investigators last week found torn-up doctor’s notes at his family home, excusing him from work for an unspecified illness. The co-pilot, 27, is believed to have deliberately crashed Germanwings Flight 9525 into the French Alps on March 24, killing all 150 people on board. Lufthansa has said that Lubitz had valid medical certification at the time of the crash. © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL", "Discover Thomson Reuters By Victoria Bryan 4 Min Read BERLIN (Reuters) - The German pilot who crashed a plane in the French Alps last week, killing 150 people, told officials at a Lufthansa training school in 2009 that he had gone through a period of severe depression, the airline said on Tuesday. The statement is potentially damaging for the airline and its CEO Carsten Spohr, who told reporters last week that the carrier knew of no reason why 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz might deliberately crash a plane. The fact that Lufthansa officials were aware that Lubitz suffered from depression raises questions about its screening process for pilots as it faces the threat of legal action from relatives of the victims. Lufthansa said Lubitz broke off his pilot training for a period of several months but then passed medical checks confirming his fitness to fly. When Lubitz resumed training in 2009, he provided the flight school with medical documents showing that he had gone through a “previous episode of severe depression,” Lufthansa said, citing emailed correspondence between Lubitz and the flight school. Duesseldorf state prosecutors said on Monday Lubitz had been treated for suicidal tendencies before getting his pilot’s licence. They last week found torn-up sick notes showing that Lubitz was suffering from an illness that should have grounded him. Related Coverage See more stories Germanwings said it had not received a sick note from Lubitz for the day of the crash. Lubitz had a valid medical certificate at the time of the crash of the Airbus A320 operated by its budget unit, Lufthansa added. Lufthansa said it had passed the email correspondence and additional documents to the Duesseldorf prosecutors after internal investigations. Lufthansa was already facing unlimited liability for damages in the crash, lawyers have said, and has told its insurers to set aside $300 million to deal with claims, recovery costs and the loss of the aircraft. For Germanwings to limit its liability, it would have to establish that it and its employees and agents were not in any way at fault or that the accident had been caused solely by the fault of a third party. Lubitz’s statement about severe depression raises more questions about what the flight school and Lufthansa did, or did not do, to make sure he was fit to fly, said New York lawyer Justin Green, who represents families in aviation disasters. “Based on the facts as they are now known, I find it hard to accept that the airline did not have the opportunity to discover that he was a danger,” Green wrote in an email. “I do not expect the airline will try to have a liability fight under the circumstances.” European pilots pass psychiatric screening ahead of starting training but annual medical checks do not include a specific in-depth psychiatric test. Pilots are expected to inform medical examiners at their annual checks of any health issues that could affect their flying ability. Psychiatrists and pilots have said there is no fail-safe test to spot suicidal pilots, but lawyers representing some of the families of victims of the Germanwings crash called on Tuesday for more regular psychiatric testing of pilots. French air accident investigators also said on Tuesday that their probe into the crash would look at psychological screening procedures for pilots and cockpit access, indicating the two areas where they are most likely to make safety recommendations that could affect the whole aviation industry. “In these cases, when you’re acting for families, they’re keen to see that lessons are learned, that pressure is put on airline authorities to improve flight safety,” Jim Morris, a partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell, told Reuters.

The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. \"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. \"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. \"Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,\" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. \"What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members.\" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it \"strongly\" disagreed with the court's decision. \"As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,\" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. \"We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,\" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as \"Palestine.\" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would \"conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality.\" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.\n"], "model_retrieved_documents": ["", "The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor has opened a formal investigation into alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories. Fatou Bensouda said the probe would cover events in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip since June 2014. Last month, the Hague-based court ruled that it could exercise its criminal jurisdiction over the territories. Israel rejected Ms Bensouda's decision, while Palestinian officials praised it. The US expressed disappointment and opposition to the move. The ICC has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes on the territory of states party to the Rome Statute, its founding treaty. Israel has never ratified the Rome Statute, but the court ruled that it had jurisdiction because the United Nations secretary general accepted the Palestinians' accession to the treaty in 2015. Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians claim the territories for a future independent state. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Ms Bensouda explained that her office was obliged to act \"where a state party has referred a situation\" to it and \"it is determined that a reasonable basis exists to commence an investigation\". Ms Bensouda said she had carried out a \"painstaking preliminary examination\" that lasted close to five years and promised that the investigation would be conducted independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favour. \"We have no agenda other than to meet our statutory duties under the Rome Statute with professional integrity,\" she said, noting that she had declined to investigate the 2010 killing by Israeli troops of 10 Turkish activists on the Gaza-bound ship Mavi Marmara. \"In the current situation, however, there is a reasonable basis to proceed and there are admissible potential cases,\" she added. Ms Bensouda, who will be succeeded by British prosecutor Karim Khan in June, also stressed that the \"central concern must be for the victims of crimes, both Palestinian and Israeli, arising from the long cycle of violence and insecurity that has caused deep suffering and despair on all sides\". The prosecutor's decision came moments before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's glitzy online election campaign launch. He used the stage to give an excoriating response, saying the probe was an anti-Semitic attack on the only Jewish state. This approach will continue in public - to undermine the court itself. Behind the scenes though, concerned officials are working to offset, delay and limit its impact. They will try to show that Israel can investigate itself and that an outgoing prosecutor is tying her successor's hands. They will roll out a plan - understood to be no-expense-spared - to minimise the chance of any future arrest of officers or politicians abroad. Israel's defence minister has acknowledged that \"hundreds\", including himself, could be at risk, adding: \"We will take care of everybody.\" And they will rely on the US and other allies for backing. But the level of rhetoric suggests Israel's leadership feels increasingly worried by the progress of the case. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the ICC's decision was \"the essence of anti-Semitism and the essence of hypocrisy.\" \"It found that our brave and moral soldiers, who are fighting the most brutal terrorists on earth, are, of all people, war criminals.\" \"The court, which was established to prevent a recurrence of the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis against the Jewish people, is now turning against the state of the Jewish people,\" he asserted. US State Department spokesman Ned Price criticised the decision. \"We firmly oppose and are disappointed by the ICC prosecutor's announcement of an investigation into the Palestinian situation,\" he said, adding the US \"will continue to uphold our strong commitment to Israel and its security including by opposing actions that seek to target Israel unfairly\". Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said: \"The crimes committed by the leaders of the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian people - which are ongoing, systematic and widespread - make this investigation necessary and urgent.\" The militant Hamas movement, which controls Gaza, welcomed the decision as \"step forward on the path of achieving justice\", while also defending its actions as \"legitimate resistance\". Campaign group Human Rights Watch said \"all eyes\" would be on incoming prosecutor Karim Khan to \"pick up the baton\", and that \"ICC member countries should stand ready to fiercely protect the court's work from any political pressure\". Ms Bensouda's preliminary examination is believed to have focused on issues such as Israeli military operations in Gaza and the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank - which most of the international community consider illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. When the Palestinians asked to accede to the Rome Statute, they recognised ICC jurisdiction for the purpose of prosecuting alleged perpetrators of crimes from 13 June 2014 onwards. That is one month before a war erupted between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. In the fighting, 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, were killed while on the Israeli side 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed. Following the preliminary examination, Ms Bensouda said there was a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes were committed in the context of the war, and that charges could be filed against Israel Defense Forces (IDF) personnel and members of Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. The prosecutor also concluded that there was a reasonable basis to believe that in the context of Israel's occupation of the West Bank, members of the Israeli authorities had committed war crimes.

The long-awaited inquiry, which has been fiercely resisted by Israel, follows years of deliberations over whether the ICC has jurisdiction to investigate and is expected to investigate alleged crimes committed by both Israelis and Palestinians. Announcing the investigation, the chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said the court would look into “crimes within the jurisdiction of the court that are alleged to have been committed” since 13 June 2014. The Gambian lawyer added that the investigation would be conducted “independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favor”. If the investigation identifies suspects allegedly responsible for crimes, prosecutors can ask judges to issue international arrest warrants, which can remain under seal to help authorities apprehend those charged. The move, which Palestinians and human rights groups said was long overdue, was immediately condemned by the Israeli foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, as “morally and legally bankrupt”. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, added: “The decision of the international court to open an investigation against Israel today for war crimes is absurd. It’s undiluted antisemitism and the height of hypocrisy.” In a videotaped statement, Netanyahu added: “The state of Israel is under attack this evening. “The ICC, which was established to prevent a repeat of the horrors the Nazis instigated against the Jewish people, now turns against the state of the Jewish people. Of course it doesn’t say a word against Iran and Syria, and other tyrannical regimes, frequently committing real war crimes,” he said. The announcement follows a 2019 decision that there was “reasonable basis” for a war crimes probe, and a ruling on 5 February that the court’s jurisdiction extends to territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 six-day war. That ruling prompted swift rejection from Jerusalem, with Netanyahu condemning the judges’ decision as “pure antisemitism”. Joe Biden’s administration said it disagreed with ICC action against Israel; however, the US is not a party to the ICC. While some Israeli officials have long feared that an ICC investigation was inevitable, the decision sets the stage for one of the court’s most controversial cases. The probe is expected to cover the 2014 Gaza war, the 2018 Gaza border clashes and Israeli settlement-building in the West Bank. The inquiry will also look at whether rocket fire by Hamas and other groups from Gaza amounts to war crimes. “The decision to open an investigation followed a painstaking preliminary examination undertaken by my office that lasted close to five years,” Bensouda said in a statement. “In the end, our central concern must be for the victims of crimes – both Palestinian and Israel – arising from the long cycle of violence and insecurity that has caused deep suffering and despair on all sides,” she added. “My office will take the same principled, non-partisan approach that it has adopted in all situations over which its jurisdiction is seized.” As an international court of last resort, the ICC is only empowered to examine cases where it is complained that local jurisdictions have not taken action. While Israel is not a party to the ICC, the Palestinian Authority was accepted after it was ruled that it fulfilled the functions of a state. The Palestinian Authority welcomed Wednesday’s move. “This long-awaited step serves Palestine’s vigorous effort to achieve justice and accountability as indispensable bases for peace,” the Palestinian foreign ministry said. It called for concluding the investigation quickly because “the crimes committed by the occupation’s leaders against the Palestinian people are lasting, systematic and far-reaching”. The Palestinians joined the court in 2015 and have long pushed for an investigation. In the past, Israeli officials have accused the court of overstepping its bounds, saying the Palestinians are not an independent sovereign state. Responding to the announcement, the Israeli president, Reuven Rivlin, described it as “scandalous.” “We will not accept claims against the exercise of our right and our obligation to defend our citizens. The state of Israel is a strong, Jewish and democratic state which knows how to defend itself and to investigate itself when necessary. “We are proud of our soldiers, our sons and daughters, the essence of our people, who stand guard for their country generation after generation, a defensive wall against all those who seek our harm.” The investigation will probably also look into alleged crimes by Palestinian militants. Bensouda has said her probe would examine the actions of Hamas, which fired rockets into Israel during the 2014 war. Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza, told Reuters: “We welcome the ICC decision to investigate Israeli occupation war crimes against our people. It is a step forward on the path of achieving justice for the victims of our people. “Our resistance is legitimate, and it comes to defend our people. All international laws approve legitimate resistance,” said Qassem. Israel blames Hamas and other militant groups for Palestinian war casualties, saying the militants use residential areas as cover to launch rockets and leave the military no choice but to strike back. Bensouda said that priorities in the investigation would be “determined in due time” based on constraints including the coronavirus pandemic, limited resources and prosecutors’ existing heavy workload.", "Palestinian Authority welcomes ruling that could see prosecution of Israeli officials and military as well as Hamas figures The international criminal court has announced that it has jurisdiction in Palestine, clearing its chief prosecutor to investigate alleged atrocities despite fierce Israeli objections. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, condemned the ruling and said the country would “protect our citizens and soldiers in every way from legal persecution”. Fatou Bensouda, the ICC chief prosecutor, has previously announced she intends to open a formal inquiry into alleged war crimes in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. However, due to Palestine’s status as an occupied territory rather than a sovereign country, she had waited for judges to “confirm” if the court, headquartered in The Hague, had the authority. Palestine used its UN observer state status, gained in 2012, to join the ICC and call for an investigation into Israeli actions. Bensouda, a Gambian lawyer, has said she would investigate both the Israeli military as well as Palestinian armed groups, including the Gaza-based Hamas faction, which has been accused of “intentionally directing attacks against civilians”, according to her office. The Palestinian Authority, an internationally recognised representative for Palestinians, still wants to pursue the case. It would see the prosecution of Israeli officials or military figures as a significant diplomatic victory. The authority is also a political rival to Hamas. The Israeli government has argued that as Palestine is not a fully fledged state, it should not be allowed to petition the court. However, in a statement released on Friday, ICC judges announced the court did in fact have jurisdiction. While making clear the court was not taking a stance on any border disputes, the judges said the court’s territorial jurisdiction extended “to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem”. It rejected Israel’s arguments, stating that Palestine had “the right to be treated as any other state party” to its statute. Hussein al-Sheikh, the Palestinian Authority’s civil affairs minister, said on Twitter that the ruling was “a victory for rights, justice, freedom and moral values in the world”. Netanyahu attacked the decision. “Today the ICC proved once again that it is a political body and not a judicial institution,” he said, adding that Israel was not a member of the ICC. While Israel has not signed up to the international treaty, the ICC’s mandate is to prosecute people, not countries, including those from states that are not signatories. Netanyahu has previously called for sanctions against the court and people who work for it. Donald Trump’s administration used a similar tactic to block a separate abandoned ICC investigation into the conduct of US troops in Afghanistan. While Joe Biden’s administration says it disagrees with ICC action against Israel, it says it is reviewing those sanctions, a move that worries Israel. However, US state department spokesman Ned Price said Washington had “serious concerns” over Friday’s ICC ruling. It was not clear if Netanyahu also intends to block ICC officials from entering the Palestinian Territories, which could hamper its work because Israel controls access to the West Bank and Jerusalem. Bensouda has said she intends to investigate incidents that occurred during the 2014 Gaza war between Israel and Hamas. The case could also be expanded to include the alleged killings by Israeli soldiers of more than 200 Palestinians, including more than 40 children, at demonstrations along the Gaza frontier. Separately, Bensouda argued there was a “reasonable basis” to believe that Israeli authorities had committed war crimes by moving Israeli civilians into the West Bank to live in settlements. Under the Geneva convention, signed after the second world war, the transfer of civilians into occupied land is prohibited.", "Decision opens the door for the tribunal’s prosecutor to open a war crimes investigation. The International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled it has jurisdiction over the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, paving the way for the tribunal’s prosecutor to open a war crimes investigation. Judges said on Friday their decision was based on jurisdictional rules in The Hague-based court’s founding documents and does not imply any attempt to determine statehood or legal borders. “The Court’s territorial jurisdiction in the Situation in Palestine … extends to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,” they said. Israel, which is not a member of the court, has rejected its jurisdiction. The court’s prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said in December 2019 there was “a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip”. Bensouda named the Israeli army and armed Palestinian groups such as Hamas as possible perpetrators. She asked judges to rule on whether the situation fell under the court’s jurisdiction, before a formal investigation would be opened. In a majority ruling published on Friday, the judges said yes. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh praised the ICC for its ruling. “This decision [of the ICC] is a victory for justice and humanity, for the values of truth, fairness and freedom, and for the blood of the victims and their families,” Shtayyeh said, according to the official Wafa news agency. Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas official, described the decision as “an important development that contributes in protecting the Palestinian people”. “We urge the international court to launch an investigation into Israeli war crimes against the Palestinian people,” said Abu Zuhri, who is currently outside Gaza. Israel and the United States reacted with furious condemnation of the court when the prosecutor made the announcement. Israel accused the International Criminal Court of “pure anti-Semitism” after it announced its jurisdiction extends to territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. “When the ICC investigates Israel for fake war crimes, this is pure anti-Semitism,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded statement. “The court established to prevent atrocities like the Nazi Holocaust against the Jewish people is now targeting the one state of the Jewish people.” He also accused the court of having a double standard. “The ICC refuses to investigate brutal dictatorships like Iran and Syria, who commit horrific atrocities almost daily,” he said. “I assure you we will fight this perversion of justice with all our might.” The US said it has “serious concerns” about the ICC’s effort to assert jurisdiction over Israeli personnel in the Palestinian territories, state department spokesman Ned Price said, adding the US government was reviewing the ruling. The administration of then-US President Donald Trump slapped sanctions on the prosecutor and another senior ICC official in September. The United States, which is not a member of the ICC, inflicted the measures on the court after earlier visa bans on Bensouda and others failed to head off the court’s war crimes probe into US military personnel in Afghanistan. The Palestinians have asked the court to look into Israeli actions during its 2014 assault against Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip, as well as Israel’s construction of settlements in the occupied West Bank and annexed East Jerusalem. The international community widely considers the settlements to be illegal under international law.

China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its \"Strike Hard\" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. Amnesty's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China, where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret. Belarus and Vietnam, too, do not release data on death penalty cases. \"The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide),\" Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty's Director of Global Issues, told CNN. \"A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition.\" While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria, \"against scores of people in some cases.\" The organization found \"positive developments\" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions. Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013. \"Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments,\" Gaughran said. \"Across the board, with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region.\" The resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year. The U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only Iran (289+), Iraq (61+), and Saudi Arabia (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available, Amnesty estimates that China also executes \"thousands\" of prisoners each year, \"more than the rest of the world put together.\" The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. \"In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards,\" the report stated. \"In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka.\" The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment. \"The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another,\" he said, in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October. \"We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights.\" Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.\n"], "model_retrieved_documents": ["", "All popular browsers allow zooming in and out by pressing the Ctrl (Cmd in OS X) and + or - keys.

Amnesty International recorded 883 executions in 20 countries in 2022, marking a 53% increase from 579 recorded in 2021. This figure represents the highest number of executions that Amnesty International has recorded in the past five years (since 2017, when 993 executions were recorded). China remained the world’s leading executioner, but the true extent of the use of the death penalty in this country remains unknown as this data remains classified as a state secret. The global figure recorded by Amnesty International excludes the thousands of executions believed to have been carried out in China, as well as those carried out in Viet Nam and North Korea where Amnesty International believes the death penalty was resorted to extensively. Most known executions took place in China (1000s), Iran (at least 576) Saudi Arabia (196), Egypt (24), and the USA (18). In 2022, 93% of known global executions (excluding China) were carried out in the Middle East and North Africa. The 196 executions recorded in Saudi Arabia were the highest yearly total known for this country in 30 years. A total of 13 women were known to have been executed in the world: Iran (12) and Saudi Arabia (1). Amnesty International recorded executions in 20 countries, compared to 18 countries in 2021. 325 executions were recorded for drug-related offences: 255 in Iran; 57 in Saudi Arabia; 11 in Singapore; and in China (+). In calculating the global total of executions carried out for drug-related offences, two were counted for China in accordance with Amnesty International’s research methodology. At least 3 public executions were recorded in Afghanistan (1+) and Iran (2). In Iran, at least 5 people were executed for crimes that occurred when they were below 18 years of age. A post shared by Amnesty International UK (@amnestyuk) Executions resumed in five countries: Afghanistan, Kuwait, Myanmar, Palestine (State of) and Singapore. Botswana, UAE and Oman carried out executions in 2021, but did not do so in 2022. The following methods of execution were used in 2022: beheading, hanging, lethal injection and shooting. At least 2,016 new death sentences across 52 countries were imposed in 2022, compared to at least 2,052 in 56 countries in 2021. Amnesty International recorded commutations or pardons of death sentences in 26 countries. Five countries — Bahrain, Comoros, Laos, Niger and South Korea — handed down death sentences after a hiatus. Amnesty International recorded at least 28 exonerations of prisoners who had been sentenced to death in four countries: Kenya (20), Morocco/Western Sahara (1), the USA (2), and Zimbabwe (5). Globally, at least 28,282 people were under sentence of death at the end of 2022. Six countries abolished the death penalty either fully (Kazakhstan, Papua New Guinea, Sierra Leone, and the Central African Republic) or partially (Equatorial Guinea and Zambia, who abolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes only) in 2022. At the end of 2022, 112 countries were abolitionist for all crimes, while 9 were abolitionist for ordinary crimes only Regional Analysis For the 14th consecutive year, the USA remained the only country in the region to carry out executions. The number of executions carried out in the USA increased by 64%, rising from 11 in 2021 to 18 in 2022. Outgoing Governor of Oregon Kate Brown commuted all remaining death sentences in the state. For the sixth consecutive year, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and the USA were the only countries in the region that imposed new death sentences. In Asia-Pacific, eight countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Japan, Myanmar, North Korea, Singapore and Viet Nam) are known to have carried out executions in 2022, an increase from five in 2021. The number of new death sentences recorded regionally increased by 5% from 819 in 2021 to 861 in 2022. Military authorities carried out the first executions in Myanmar in four decades, including the execution of two high-profile opposition politicians. Executions also resumed after a hiatus in Afghanistan and Singapore. Papua New Guinea became the 21st country in the Asia-Pacific region to abolish the death penalty for all crimes. Belarus carried out one execution in 2022. It was the only country in Europe and Central Asia to do so. Kazakhstan abolished the death penalty for all crimes and ratified a key UN treaty on abolition. Russia and Tajikistan continued to observe moratoriums on executions. The number of executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa region increased by 59%, rising from 520 in 2021 to 825 in 2022. 94% of executions recorded in the region were carried out in Iran (70%) and Saudi Arabia (24%). Executions resumed in Kuwait and the State of Palestine for the first time since 2017. Recorded death sentences in the region decreased slightly from 834 in 2021 to 827 in 2022. Death sentences were imposed in 16 countries in 2022, compared to 17 in 2021. Recorded executions in the region decreased by 67%, from 33 in 2021 to 11 in 2022.

Last year saw a worrying rise in executions and death sentences in some countries after earlier Covid-19 restrictions were removed from courts. Amnesty’s Report, Death Sentences and Executions 2021, is an authoritative annual survey on the death penalty and shows that at least 579 executions were known to have been carried out in 18 countries last year⁠, a 20% increase on the recorded total for 2020⁠. As in previous years, the data does not include the thousands of people Amnesty believes were executed in China, as well as the significant number of executions thought to have taken place in North Korea and Vietnam. State secrecy in these countries make it impossible to accurately monitor executions. Amnesty’s report also emphasises that some of the figures should be regarded as minimum figures. One disturbing trend was the effect of a lifting of earlier Covid-19 restrictions on judicial buildings including courts in various countries. With these steadily re-opening during 2021, judges handed down at least 2,052 death sentences in 56 countries - almost 40% more than in 2020. Overall, by the end of last year at least 28,670 people were under sentence of death around the world. However, Amnesty’s report also shows that an underlying long-term trend toward reduced use of capital punishment continued during 2021, with the yearly death toll of 573 making it the second-lowest (after 2020) recorded by Amnesty since at least 2010. In the USA, 2021 saw the lowest number of executions (11) since 1988, while Virginia became the 23rd state - and first southern state - to abolish the death penalty, and the Biden administration established a temporary moratorium on federal executions in July. The minority of countries that still retain the death penalty are on notice: a world without state-sanctioned killing is not only imaginable - it is within reach and we will continue to fight for it. - Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General Read the full report below.

But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a China's \"Strike Hard\" campaign against unrest in Xinjiang, a campaign the government claims was launched to combat \"terrorism\" and \"separatism.\" But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today, Amnesty International releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.  Much of it makes for grim reading. In Pakistan, the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows.  Iran and Iraq executed people for \"terrorism,\" and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates. Jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime.  In Indonesia, authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety \"national emergency.\" Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in Egypt and Nigeria, where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as United Nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At Amnesty International, we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include China, where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The Americas continued to be execution-free, apart from the United States. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment.

Just two weeks after her supposed death on March 31, 1945, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated -- timing that showed how close the Jewish diarist had been to surviving the Holocaust. But new research released by the Anne Frank House shows that Anne and her older sister, Margot Frank, died at least a month earlier than previously thought. Researchers re-examined archives of the Red Cross, the International Training Service and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial, along with testimonies of survivors. They concluded that Anne and Margot probably did not survive to March 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by Dutch authorities. In 1944, Anne and seven others hiding in the Amsterdam secret annex were arrested and sent to the  Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Anne Frank's final entry. That same year, Anne and Margot were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany. Days at the camp were filled with terror and dread, witnesses said. The sisters stayed in a section of the overcrowded camp with no lighting, little water and no latrine. They slept on lice-ridden straw and violent storms shredded the tents, according to the researchers. Like the other prisoners, the sisters endured long hours at roll call. Her classmate, Nannette Blitz, recalled seeing Anne there in December 1944: \"She was no more than a skeleton by then. She was wrapped in a blanket; she couldn't bear to wear her clothes anymore because they were crawling with lice.\" Listen to Anne Frank's friends describe her concentration camp experience. As the Russians advanced further, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp became even more crowded, bringing more disease. A deadly typhus outbreak caused thousands to die each day. Typhus is an infectious disease caused by lice that breaks out in places with poor hygiene. The disease causes high fever, chills and skin eruptions. \"Because of the lice infesting the bedstraw and her clothes, Anne was exposed to the main carrier of epidemic typhus for an extended period,\" museum researchers wrote. They concluded that it's unlikely the sisters survived until March, because witnesses at the camp said the sisters both had symptoms before February 7. \"Most deaths caused by typhus occur around twelve days after the first symptoms appear,\" wrote  authors Erika Prins and Gertjan Broek. The exact dates of death for Anne and Margot remain unclear. Margot died before Anne. \"Anne never gave up hope,\" said Blitz, her friend. \"She was absolutely convinced she would survive.\" Her diary endures as one of the world's most popular books.

But, now, a new report is calling that into question: its authors concluded that Anne’s commonly-accepted death date of late March 1945 is at least a month off. The Anne Frank House museum has announced that Frank probably died in February 1945, a good month before the death date traditionally estimated by historians. Historians estimated the new date based on a reassessment of eyewitness accounts and Red Cross documents that used to place Anne’s death date in March 1945. Their report was published yesterday on what was formerly thought to be the 70th anniversary of the death of Anne and her sister Margot, who were captured, forced into slave labor at Auschwitz-Birkenau and left to die of typhus at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The new narrative challenges the assumption that if the Franks had held on just a little longer, they’d have made it to the camp’s liberation, Anne Frank House researcher Erika Prins told the Guardian: “When you say they died at the end of March, it gives you a feeling that they died just before liberation. So maybe if they’d lived two more weeks …” Prins said, her voice trailing off. “Well, that’s not true any more.” Seventy years later, the story of the Franks still has the power to intrigue, sparking interest in everything from her relatives to her childhood to her complex legacy. A new perspective on her death places her more squarely in the ranks of more than six million Jews and other civilians who died in over 40,000 ghettos and camps under Nazi rule.

Anne Frank, a Jewish teenager, wrote a diary of her family’s two years in hiding (1942–44) during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, and the book—which was first published in 1947, two years after Anne’s death in a concentration camp—became a classic of war literature, personalizing the Holocaust. Through her diary, Anne Frank is shown to be insightful, humorous, and intelligent. Many entries involve typical adolescent issues—jealousy toward her sister; annoyance with others, especially her mother; and an increasing sexual awareness. Anne also discussed her hopes for the future, which included becoming a journalist or a writer. On August 4, 1944, Anne Frank’s family’s hiding place was discovered by the Gestapo, and she was taken to Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland before being transferred to Bergen-Belsen in Germany. According to the Dutch government, Anne died during a typhus epidemic in March 1945. Other research suggests she might have perished in February that year.

Early in the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, Anne’s father, Otto Frank (1889–1980), a German businessman, took his wife and two daughters to live in Amsterdam. In 1941, after German forces occupied the Netherlands, Anne was compelled to transfer from a public school to a Jewish one. On June 12, 1942, she received a red-and-white plaid diary for her 13th birthday. That day she began writing in the book: “I hope I will be able to confide everything to you, as I have never been able to confide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support.” When Anne’s sister, Margot, was faced with deportation (supposedly to a forced-labour camp), the Franks went into hiding on July 6, 1942, in the backroom office and warehouse of Otto Frank’s food-products business. With the aid of a few non-Jewish friends, among them Miep Gies, who smuggled in food and other supplies, the Frank family and four other Jews—Hermann and Auguste van Pels and their son, Peter, and Fritz Pfeffer—lived confined to the “secret annex.” During this time, Anne wrote faithfully in her diary, recounting day-to-day life in hiding, from ordinary annoyances to the fear of capture. She discussed typical adolescent issues as well as her hopes for the future, which included becoming a journalist or a writer. Anne’s last diary entry was written on August 1, 1944. Three days later the annex was discovered by the Gestapo, which was acting on a tip from Dutch informers. The Frank family was transported to Westerbork, a transit camp in the Netherlands, and from there to Auschwitz, in German-occupied Poland, on September 3, 1944, on the last transport to leave Westerbork for Auschwitz. Anne and Margot were transferred to Bergen-Belsen the following month. Anne’s mother died in early January, just before the evacuation of Auschwitz on January 18, 1945. It was established by the Dutch government that both Anne and Margot died in a typhus epidemic in March 1945, only weeks before the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, but scholars in 2015 revealed new research, including analysis of archival data and first-person accounts, indicating that the sisters might have perished in February 1945. Otto Frank was found hospitalized at Auschwitz when it was liberated by Soviet troops on January 27, 1945. Friends who searched the hiding place after the family’s capture later gave Otto Frank the papers left behind by the Gestapo. Among them he found Anne’s diary, which was published as Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl (originally in Dutch, 1947). Precocious in style and insight, it traces her emotional growth amid adversity. In it she wrote, “I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are really good at heart.” The Diary, which has been translated into more than 65 languages, is the most widely read diary of the Holocaust, and Anne is probably the best known of Holocaust victims. The Diary was also made into a play that premiered on Broadway in October 1955, and in 1956 it won both the Tony Award for best play and the Pulitzer Prize for best drama. A film version directed by George Stevens was produced in 1959. The play was controversial: it was challenged by screenwriter Meyer Levin, who wrote an early version of the play (later realized as a 35-minute radio play) and accused Otto Frank and his chosen screenwriters, Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, of sanitizing and de-Judaizing the story. The play was often performed in high schools throughout the world and was revived (with additions) on Broadway in 1997–98. A new English translation of the Diary, published in 1995, contains material that was edited out of the original version, which makes the revised translation nearly one-third longer than the first.

January 12, 2016 Yesterday, staff and volunteers of the Commission participated in an enrichment session addressing changes to the scholarship about Anne Frank. The program examined new research about the deaths of Anne and Margot Frank. January 11 Volunteer Enrichment.jpg On March 31, 2015, the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam published new research clarifying the death dates of the Frank sisters at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The exact date of the sisters' deaths has never been known for sure. After the war, the Red Cross officially concluded that they died of typhus some time between March 1 and 31, 1945. The new research states that it is unlikely they were still alive in March; their deaths must have occurred in February. The research utilized the archives of the Red Cross, the International Tracing Service in Bad Arolsen, and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial. It also included a combination of eyewitness testimonies from survivors, existing literature, and scientific statistics for the progression of the disease that killed the Frank sisters. Typhus is fatal in 40-60% of cases around 12 days after the first symptoms appear. (Source: Anne Frank House.) Anne and Margot were showing symptoms in January 1945. The disease was rampant at the camp, spreading rapidly in the unsanitary conditions. Between July and December 1944, the number of prisoners at Bergen-Belsen doubled. By February 1945, that number increased by another 50%. With this massive influx of new prisoners, which included Anne and Margot who were transported from Auschwitz, conditions at the camp worsened considerably. Witnesses who knew the Frank sisters provided testimony confirming that they girls died within days of each other. Margot perished before her younger sister. Anne and Margot were among tens of thousands of prisoners who died in the first few months of 1945 from typhus, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and dysentery. The camp was liberated by British forces on April 15, 1945. More than 13,000 former prisoners died after liberation. They were too ill to recover and the British burned down the whole camp in order to prevent any further spread of disease.

(AP) — The swift discovery of the person who hung a noose at Duke University leaves questions ranging from the student’s identity to what punishment the person will face. The university has begun disciplinary proceedings that could result in suspension or expulsion, while federal and state law enforcement officials are investigating whether the action constitutes a crime. The university identified the person after several fellow students came forward with information, and the undergraduate student admitted to hanging the noose from a tree at a plaza in the heart of campus, university spokesman Michael Schoenfeld said Thursday. Schoenfeld said the student has left campus but is still enrolled. He declined to describe the culprit’s gender, race or whether the student had been in trouble in the past, citing privacy laws. On Thursday, the plaza where the noose was hung teemed with students enjoying a sunny afternoon and discussing what happened. Sarah Burks, a junior English major from North Carolina, said punishing the culprit is the right move but that it’s not going to change a campus culture in which “there’s definitely still a lot of separation between different groups.” She says friends of hers have experienced racism on campus. “There’s nothing else they can do when something like this ends up on the front page of the New York Times. They have to find the person,” she said of university administrators. Officials say the noose was found about 2 a.m. Wednesday in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building. Black Student Alliance vice president Henry Washington said he and about 14 other students saw the noose hanging overnight after being alerted via Twitter. On Thursday, he praised the reaction of fellow students and administrators at the school. “I appreciate that immediate action was taken both by the student community to identify a person and by the faculty to ensure that disciplinary action is taken,” he said. Duke Student Affairs Vice President Larry Moneta said the student responsible for the noose would face judgment under the school’s code of conduct, which includes penalties ranging from probation to expulsion. He said it was “too soon to make any comment” about whether the student had expressed remorse. “This is all part of what the investigation will yield and the opportunity for the student to speak to the basis for the behavior,” Moneta said. At a gathering Wednesday in front of the university’s Gothic chapel building, Duke President Richard Brodhead told a crowd of several thousand that their presence was a rejection of what the noose symbolizes in a region where lynchings were once used to terrorize black residents. And he said that while administrators and campus police investigate the case, it is up to each individual to reject racism. On Thursday, senior math major Marshall Ratliff was walking by the Bryan Center shortly after the announcement that someone admitted hanging the noose. Ratliff said he was happy the person responsible was found out. “Duke is making it clear as a student and faculty community that this sort of bias and antagonism is not going to be tolerated on campus,” he said.

The college announced that the individual has been identified as a result of its investigation but the person's name has not been released. What, if any, punishment the student will face remains unknown. \"The student is no longer on campus,\" Duke spokesman Keith Lawrence said, declining to give any further explanation though noting that no punishment has been issued since the individual has not yet gone through the school's judicial hearing system. \"The student will be subject to Duke’s student conduct process,\" the school statement said. Lawrence told ABC News that he could not speculate on the possible punishment in this case. In the past, conduct boards made up of a mix of students and faculty members have issued punishments for students found guilty that range from some form of disciplinary action to suspension or expulsion. The investigation into the noose, which was reportedly found hanging from a tree early Wednesday morning, is ongoing as officials said they must determine if the student acted alone. The student may also be subject to criminal charges, depending on what state and federal officials determine. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events", "The browser or device you are using is out of date.

A Duke University student has admitted to placing a noose in a tree on the campus in Durham, North Carolina and could be disciplined, a school spokesman said on Thursday. The rope, found on Wednesday, was taken down by school officials, who vowed to hold accountable anyone found responsible for the incident described by an official as an \"act of intimidation.\" More than 1,000 students, faculty and others gathered at events on campus on Wednesday to express outrage over the incident, the school said. The student was identified after the school encouraged anyone with information about the noose to call campus police. Fellow students came forward with information, said school spokesman Keith Lawrence. The student will face an undergraduate student conduct inquiry that could result in a range of sanctions, from lesser disciplinary action, to suspension or expulsion, Lawrence said. \"The university continues to review the circumstances of the incident to determine if additional individuals were involved,\" the school said in a statement, adding that it continues to work with state and federal officials \"about potential criminal violations.\" Officials say the noose was found about 2 a.m. in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building. Black Student Alliance vice president Henry Washington said he and about 14 other students saw the noose hanging overnight after being alerted via Twitter. “We wanted to see if it was an actual thing. And yeah, there it was,” said Washington, a sophomore from Aliceville, Alabama. President Richard Brodhead and Provost Sally Kornbluth earlier sent a joint email to students, saying the Duke campus “has been jolted over the past few weeks by several racial incidents, including a report of hateful speech directed at students on East Campus” and the discovery of the noose. “To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,” Larry Moneta, Duke's vice president for student affairs, wrote in an email to students. Brodhead, Washington and other members of the Black Student Alliance had previously scheduled a meeting Wednesday morning to discuss the campus atmosphere for blacks. “Obviously the conversation needed to shift to kind of the things that happened this morning. We expressed to President Brodhead that students were just kind of exhausted. Students didn't know how to feel,” Washington said. A noose in general is a racially charged symbol of lynching, or extrajudicial public execution by hanging, a once common practice in parts of the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By one estimate, some 3,500 African-Americans were lynched from 1882 to 1968. Students Tara-Marie Desruisseaux, 19, of New York, and Jada Gibbs, 19, of Dumont, New Jersey, said the incident came days after they helped host a recruiting weekend at Duke for talented black high school students from around the country. Duke has about 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students. It costs about $60,000 a year to attend as an undergraduate, including room and board, according to the school's website. About half of all undergraduate students receive financial aid. “Now I feel like they're looking back at us and wondering, what were they selling me and what do they accept that they think Duke is so great?” Desruisseaux said. While minorities may be forced to cope with racism at other selective universities, “I think the fact that Duke is in the South gives it something different from Stanford or Harvard,” she said. “I think the way that racism resonates is a lot stronger here just because not that long ago Duke's campus was segregated and the only blacks on this campus were cleaning up bathrooms.” Freshman student Anika Richter said though she is half-Japanese and half-Colombian, growing up in Baltimore meant many of her friends were black. “Honestly, I'm appalled and embarrassed to go to the school right now,” said Richter, who saw a photo of the noose on Facebook just after waking up Wednesday. “Coming to Duke, I was very nervous about the racial tensions at the school but I never actually imagined that something so blatantly racist could happen here.” The incident at Duke is the latest alleged racist behavior at a university. Last month, U.S. prosecutors said a former University of Mississippi student had been indicted on civil rights charges accusing him of draping a noose and a Confederate flag around the neck of a statue of that school's first black student. At the University of Washington, the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity is under fire for another incident of alleged racist behavior after black students at the University of Washington accused local chapter members of calling them “apes” and making obscene gestures, according to The Seattle Times. That allegation came just days after the University of Oklahoma shuttered SAE’s campus chapter following the release of a video of fraternity members chanting a song that used a racial slur against blacks and said that blacks would never be admitted to the group.

Schuller, California televangelist and founder of the television ministry \"Hour of Power,\" died Thursday, according to his family. He was 88 years old. Schuller, also the founder of Crystal Cathedral megachurch, had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in August 2013, a release from \"Hour of Power\" said. \"My father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning. He was a great Dad and a great man of God,\" said Schuller's daughter-in-law, Donna Schuller, in a Twitter message. Schuller's life followed an almost Shakespearean arc. He was born in a Iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days. In his autobiography, \"Prayer: My Soul's Adventure with God,\" he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation. After attending a Hope College and Western Theological Seminary in Michigan, he met his wife of more than 60 years, Arvella, while preaching at her church (she was the organist). With their young family in tow, the Schullers caravanned west to California, where he rented a drive-in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar. It was beneath the dignity of Christian ministry, some local pastors huffed. The \"passion pits\" where teenagers necked was no place for the gospel. Schuller was undeterred, and he quickly outgrew the drive-in. He called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a \"miracle,\" though his many mainstream critics had other names for it. His confident, breezy version of Christianity -- too breezy, by some estimations -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed Christians who were put off by the hellfire fulminations of many post-War American preachers. Schuller sold a softer, gentler message, which borrowed heavily, he acknowledged, from the father of the feel-good gospel, Norman Vincent Peale. He preached not to convert or condemn people, but to encourage them, a sentiment he called \"possibility thinking.\" People loved it. \"Evangelicalism at its best wants to be innovative and reach people,\" said Timothy Larsen, a professor of Christian thought at Wheaton College in Illinois. \"And Schuller was a master at that.\" \"What he got right is that the gospel is good news,\" Larsen continued. \"And he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope.\" Some of Schuller's favored phrases, though, struck others as cornpone Christianity. \"Turn your hurt into a halo?\" said Randall Balmer, a professor of American religious history at Dartmouth College, citing one such phrase. \"That's pretty weak tea.\" Still, Balmer gives Schuller some credit. \"It may be bad theology, but it's brilliant marketing.\" In 1970, Schuller began broadcasting \"Hour of Power,\" believed to be one of the first, if not the very first, Sunday service to be shown regularly on television. With his genial smile, priestly robes and gray hair, he looked and talked like a guy who wanted nothing more than to see his flock succeed. The show, which ran for decades, reached millions, making Schuller a televangelist before the term became tarnished by the sins of his many successors. Schuller's crowning achievement, at least architecturally, still stands in Orange County, California, though it is now owned by the Roman Catholic Church. The Crystal Cathedral, a great gleaming edifice with 10,000 glass panels, gave worshipers a look at the  clouds that house the heavens, while Schuller preached in the pulpit below. The message was clear to many: The road to the former ran through the latter. During the 1980s and 1990s, Schuller's star continued to rise, with presidents stopping by the Crystal Cathedral -- often during campaigns, it should be said -- and future megachurch pastors like Rick Warren and Bill Hybels seeking his advice. As Schuller aged, though, his family was beset by a succession scandal straight from the pages of \"King Lear.\"  He tried to install his only son, Bobby Jr., as pastor of Crystal Cathedral. But the preaching styles of father and son were too different for the congregation -- measured at times at 10,000 strong -- to countenance. Bobby Schuller Jr. left \"Hour of Power\" and the pulpit at Crystal Cathedral after a short time. As the family searched for a new successor and tussled over finances, viewers and donations to the church and its television show dropped precipitously. Crystal Cathedral Ministries filed for bankruptcy in 2010, citing debts of more than $43 million, according to The Associated Press. Schuller's empire, which once soared as high as his glassy cathedral, had fallen to dust. Eventually, Schuller's grandson, also named Bobby, took over \"Hour of Power,\" though at a different church. In a statement on Thursday, the younger Schuller recalled standing atop Crystal Cathedral's 12-story Tower of Hope with his grandfather as they surveyed the surrounding landscape. \"You could see the whole world from there,\" he said.

CNN's Stella Chan reported from Los Angeles.\n"], "model_retrieved_documents": ["Robert Harold Schuller (September 16, 1926 – April 2, 2015) was an American Christian televangelist, pastor, motivational speaker, and author. In his five decades of television, Schuller was principally known for the weekly Hour of Power television program, which he began hosting in 1970 until his retirement in 2006. His grandson, Bobby Schuller, carries on the Hour of Power now airing for over fifty years.[1] During his time as a minister, Schuller oversaw the construction of two churches in Garden Grove, CA. The first church built under his tenure was the Garden Grove Community Church chapel, which seated 500, and the second that he oversaw was the building of the much larger Crystal Cathedral, which has a seating capacity of 2,200. Schuller began broadcasting his Hour of Power program from the smaller Garden Grove chapel in 1969. He made the decision to begin his broadcast of Hour of Power shortly after he had received encouragement from longtime friend Billy Graham during a visit with the popular evangelist.[2] The Hour of Power broadcast later continued in the Crystal Cathedral.[3] Like his good friend Billy Graham, the Schuller organization never became closely associated with any major scandal. During the 90's his televised sermons were regularly viewed by an estimated audience of 20 million.[4] Schuller's weekly telecast of his sermons which began in 1969 was one of the first instances of such weekly televised church services, and was the world's most widely watched hour-long church service ever.[3] Robert Harold Schuller was born on September 16, 1926, near Alton, Iowa, the second son of Jennie (née Beltman; 1891–1970) and Anthony Schuller (1882–1964).[5] He was the youngest of five children. All of his grandparents were Dutch immigrants,[6] and he was raised on his parents' farm nearby in a small, close-knit community of Dutch-Americans, without running water.[7] In 1927 on the day of his baptism at his family’s Reformed Church in Newkirk, Iowa, the six month old Schuller was clothed in a certain \"baptismal-gown.” Years later Schuller announced that he had kept his baptismal-gown and placed it on display in his office, referring to it as his most-prized-possession. To Schuller apparently the gown had represented the day that his life had first been dedicated to God. In his later years Schuller placed an inscription beneath the gown reading: \"This is the reason my life has been a success. As a child I was dedicated to our Lord.\"[8] In 1931, just weeks before his fifth birthday a visiting uncle who was a minister had predicted that the young boy was destined to spread the word of God to many when he grew up. Schuller called the moment that he had first heard his uncle's prediction the \"single most defining moment of my early life.\"[9] After graduating from Newkirk High School in Newkirk, Iowa, in 1944,[10] Schuller continued his education at Hope College, located in Holland, Michigan. In 1950, now studying at Western Theological Seminary, Schuller received his Master of Divinity degree. The seminary teaches in the theological tradition and practice of John Calvin. He was soon ordained as a minister in the Reformed Church in America. After his ordination, he first worked at Ivanhoe Reformed Church in Riverdale, Illinois, before moving to Garden Grove, California. In Garden Grove, California in 1955 Schuller opened what would be his first church in the area, which he called the “Garden Grove Community Church.” At the time, Schuller was trying out a relatively new concept in “church service presentation” known as the “Drive-in Church Model.“[11] His new church was located in the old Orange Drive-in Movie Theater where churchgoers could enjoy their church services from the comfort of their own cars. For the benefit of those who preferred more traditional church services, he later also rented a 300-seat former Baptist church, about four miles (6 km) down the road from his new drive-in theater church. On Sunday mornings Schuller would first preside at a 9:30 service in the Baptist chapel and then he would deliver his organ to the roof of the concession stand at the old drive-in theater where he would then preside over his second Sunday service.[12] As the size of the congregations grew, Schuller purchased 10 acres (4.0 ha) of land at 12141 Lewis Street in Garden Grove for a \"walk-in, drive-in\" church, serving both congregations. Ground was broken September 10, 1958 for construction of Schuller's second church-home in the area, which was designed by international architect Richard Neutra. This second church was completed in 1961, at a cost of $3 million[13][14] (equivalent to $29 million in 2022). The dedication service was held November 5, 1961.[15] The design of the new church building enabled Schuller to preach his sermons to worshipers in 500 cars, as well as to members of the congregation inside the church.[16] Schuller's second area church was built on what was to later become a part of the campus of his future (and much larger) \"Crystal Cathedral Church.\" Seven years later in 1968 a \"Tower of Hope\" steeple structure was added onto the north side of the property. The Tower of Hope structure rose 13 stories (approximately 130 to 150 feet (40 to 46 m) into the air and was the tallest structure in Orange County at that time.[citation needed] The steeple structure was then topped by an illuminated cross which added another 90 feet (27 m) to the structure's overall height.[citation needed] Also in 1968, Schuller purchased a 10-acre (4.0 ha) walnut grove that had bordered on the north boundary of the then current Garden Grove Community Church property. This new purchase of land was to enable the construction of a future much larger Crystal Cathedral on the newly expanded property. The architectural firm of Philip Johnson/John Burgee was soon retained to draw up plans for a primarily glass church that would be able to accommodate over 2,000 church goers, which was to be built on a spot on the newly expanded church campus adjacent to the original church structure. In order to meet the needs of the church's ever expanding congregation, the architectural firm designed a reflective glass building that could seat 2,248 people.[17][18] At the time that it was built, the church was touted as \"the largest glass building in the world.\" The church was dedicated on September 14, 1980.[19] Once the newer, larger, and more noticeable \"Crystal Cathedral\" structure was completed, Schuller renamed his organization as the \"Crystal Cathedral Ministries.\" Schuller's Crystal Cathedral Church soon became the iconic backdrop from which he preached his popular Hour of Power broadcasts every Sunday morning for the next 25 years. These broadcasts regularly reached a world wide audience of 20 million.[4] Schuller emphasized what he believed are the positive aspects of the Christian faith. He deliberately avoided condemning people for sin, believing that Jesus \"met needs before touting creeds\". Once in a relationship with God, Schuller emphasized, someone who is sowing positive faith in his heart and actions will discover that the by-product is a reduction of sin. He was known to say, \"Sin is a condition before it is an action.\" Schuller encouraged Christians and non-Christians to achieve great things through God and to believe in their dreams. He wrote, \"If you can dream it, you can do it!\"[20] As the Crystal Cathedral's founding pastor, Schuller was seen and heard internationally on Sundays on the world's most widely watched hour-long church service, the Hour of Power, 1,500 of which were recorded.[3] On June 15, 1950, Schuller married Arvella De Haan (1929–2014), a church organist, who became instrumental in developing the music department at the Crystal Cathedral and was the creator and producer of the Hour of Power for over 40 years. The Schullers had five children: Sheila, Tim, Robert, Jeanne, Carol, and Gretchen.[21] On January 22, 2006, Schuller's son, Robert A. Schuller, assumed the role of senior pastor of the Crystal Cathedral. On October 25, 2008, however, he resigned. His father cited \"a lack of shared vision\" as the cause.[22] Schuller stated that \"different ideas as to the direction and the vision for this ministry\" with his son \"made it necessary ... to part ways in the Hour of Power television ministry\".[23] Schuller also said \"I love my son and am proud of my son\" and that the long-term survival of his ministry was dependent on expanding its imprint beyond the Schuller name. \"The real minister's name that we honor is Jesus, not Schuller\", he said. The ministry then opened the pulpit to a variety of notable Christian speakers.[24] On June 11, 2009, Schuller announced that the church's leadership would pass to his eldest daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman. On July 11, 2010, he announced that he was retiring as principal pastor of the Crystal Cathedral and would become chairman of the church's board of directors.[25] After a year as interim senior pastor, Sheila Schuller Coleman was elevated to senior pastor in July 2010. In the wake of Robert Schuller's retirement and after much sorting out, in 2013 Robert H. Schuller's grandson, Bobby V. Schuller moved the remaining congregation from the Crystal Cathedral building and eventually into the somewhat smaller Shepherd's Grove church building in nearby Irvine, CA. Along the way, from 2013 through 2018 the congregation also temporarily leased what had formerly been the St. Callistus Catholic church of Garden Grove for their Sunday services. During these years Schuller's grandson took over the leadership of the remaining congregation and also resumed the broadcast of his grandfather's Hour of Power weekly TV broadcast. The Crystal Cathedral building and its campus was then sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange for use as its diocesan cathedral and offices. Subsequently, the Diocese of Orange renamed the building as the Christ Cathedral. On October 18, 2010, Coleman announced that the Crystal Cathedral was seeking bankruptcy protection, in the midst of what became known as the Great Recession.[26] In May 2011, the senior Schullers, along with their daughter Carol and her husband Tim, were dismissed from the ministry at the Crystal Cathedral.[27] They filed for bankruptcy. The court would eventually allow them approximately 20 percent of what they were owed.[28] The creditors would be paid in full plus interest. In July 2011, it was reported in the Orange County Register that Schuller had been ousted from the Crystal Cathedral board.[29] In July 2011, Coleman attempted to reverse the decision that had been made in her absence, saying, \"Dad will continue to provide leadership for this ministry through me for as long as possible\" and, \"I have and will continue to defer to his wisdom and honor him for his unprecedented accomplishments.\"[30] On March 11, 2012, after months of attempting to change the attitude of the ministry's board, Coleman told the Crystal Cathedral congregation that she was leaving to start a new church because of \"a hostile work environment\".[31] The International Business Times reported that this came following \"a bitter fallout between the ministry and its founding family\".[32] According to the Religion News Service, the founders were left with little to no assets; their home was fully mortgaged.[citation needed] On January 24, 2013, the Crystal Cathedral's board of directors voted to make Bobby Schuller, Schuller's grandson (son of Robert Anthony Schuller), the new pastor for the Hour of Power[33] television program as well as a non-voting member of the board.[34] In late August 2013, Robert H. Schuller was diagnosed with esophageal cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes. A follow-up examination in September 2013 presented Schuller with the possibility of undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy that could extend his life. Schuller then agreed to receive the cancer treatments, which may have been responsible for extending his life by nearly two more years as had been predicted by his physicians.[35][36] Arvella Schuller died on February 11, 2014, aged 84.[37] The Schullers had been married for 63 years. Schuller died peacefully, early on the morning of April 2, 2015 at a nursing facility in Artesia, California, aged 88. His funeral was held at Christ Cathedral, the former campus of the Crystal Cathedral. He is interred next to his wife at the Christ Cathedral Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Garden Grove, California.[38][39][40] Schuller authored over 30 hardcover books, 6 of which made The New York Times and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists,[41][42][43] including:", "The Rev.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Crystal Cathedral founder and former televangelist the Rev. Robert H. Schuller has been diagnosed with cancer, his daughter said Thursday. Carol Schuller Milner told The Associated Press that Schuller, 86, has a fist-sized tumor in his esophagus that has spread to his lymph nodes. Schuller's oncologists said the tumor was either at or near stage 4 — the most serious cancer classification — but it has yet to reach his vital organs and he has been strong enough for treatment. Milner said her father \"doesn't have a lot of energy\" but has been \"very reflective, very peaceful and truly beautiful.\" \"He's closer to heaven than he is to this tangible world,\" Milner said. Another daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman, first revealed news that Schuller was undergoing treatment in an Aug. 25 sermon at her new church, the Hope Center of Christ. The elder Schuller decided to pursue the treatment after praying with his wife, Arvella, and other family members, Schuller Coleman said. Doctors said the televangelist had three months to live, but then said he could live for two years with radiation and chemotherapy. Schuller began preaching in 1955 from the top of a drive-in movie theater concession stand in Orange County and by 1970 had launched a TV ministry with the \"Hour of Power.\" He built the landmark cathedral in 1980. At its peak, the broadcast attracted 20 million viewers around the world but in recent years, Schuller's ministry was hamstrung by a disastrous leadership transition and a decline in viewership and donations. The once-popular televangelist resigned from the church's board in 2012, two years after the ministry filed for bankruptcy. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange bought the cathedral in bankruptcy proceedings and renamed the building Christ Cathedral.

Schuller, who attempted to integrate the teachings of John Calvin with the positive thinking of Norman Vincent Peale, and lost his famed Crystal Cathedral to bankruptcy, died Thursday at age 88, according to the Hour of Power ministry he started. He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the summer of 2013. After becoming one of the nation's best-known pastors, Schuller watched his megachurch empire — that started in a drive-in theater — crumble amid huge debt and family squabbles over leadership. In 2011, a bankruptcy proceeding reached a $57.5 million deal to permit the Catholic Diocese of Orange to purchase the iconic glass sanctuary in Garden Grove, Calif. The remaining Protestant congregation, Shepherd's Grove, moved to a Roman Catholic church building with half the seating capacity of its former home, led by Schuller's grandson, Bobby Schuller. \"I have the incredible honor of carrying on my grandfather's legacy by teaching people that they are not what they do, not what they have, and not what people say about them. They are the beloved of God,\" Bobby Schuller said in a statement. In 2012, Robert H. and Arvella Schuller resigned from the ministry they began more than 50 years before, citing differences with its board. Their only son Robert A. Schuller, onetime heir apparent, served as senior pastor for two years, resigning in 2008 after disputes about the ministry's direction. Sheila Schuller Coleman, their oldest daughter, took on the pastoral role but left in 2012 and started a church nearby. Despite the \"tragedy\" of family dissension that marked the end of Schuller's career, evangelical scholar Richard Mouw said he was \"one of the great church leaders in the 20th century. \"The very idea of the original congregation in Anaheim, of a drive-in church, was very innovative,\" said Mouw, the former president of Fuller Theological Seminary. \"It was, I think, motivated in great part by a desire to reach people who ordinarily would not come to a church.\" But as other large church leaders took megachurch ministries and religious broadcasting in new directions, Schuller had a devotion to the Protestant tradition and maintained the \"dignity of worship,\" Mouw said, wearing a clerical robe on international television and having a renowned choir and \"one of the finest organs in the world.\" The author of more than 30 books, including five New York Times best-sellers, Robert Schuller was best known for his four decades of televised Sunday services, Hour of Power. From his soaring Crystal Cathedral, Schuller's program was broadcast in five languages and 50 nations, with a worldwide audience of 20 million per week. Along the way, his popularity in America surpassed the likes of Oral Roberts and Pat Robertson. It was a distinction that Schuller wore well. Earlier in his career, he had emerged largely unscathed from the \"earthquake,\" as he called it — the Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart scandals of the late 1980s that had rocked the world of televangelism. Schuller was also one of the most touted leaders of the Reformed Church in America, which sometimes identified itself as \"the denomination of Norman Vincent Peale and Robert Schuller.\" But like Peale, Schuller had his share of critics. Some Christians were scornful of his celebration of \"possibility thinking,\" and attacked his \"theology of self-esteem,\" saying that it muted biblical warnings of sin and evil through a blend of gospel and psychology. That combination, they said, treated morality as merely a relative code of values. Schuller dismissed the charges. \"I don't think anything has been done in the name of Christ and under the banner of Christianity that has proven more destructive to human personality and, hence, counterproductive to the evangelism enterprise than the often crude, uncouth, and un-Christian strategy of attempting to make people aware of their lost and sinful condition,\" Schuller told Christianity Today. This view surfaced notably in 1998, when — at the height of then-President Clinton's sex scandal — Schuller tempered criticism of Clinton by saying \"we all share part of the shame.\" He argued that the nation's stubbornly high approval ratings of Clinton had enabled the president to avoid confronting his behavior. The year before, Schuller had been thanked by Clinton in a State of the Union address, in which Clinton credited the evangelist with advising him to read Isaiah for strength in leading America. Born in 1926, Schuller was reared in a religious Iowan family of Dutch descent. He later said he knew he wanted to be a minister. As part of his seminary studies, he wrote an index of Calvin's four-volume Institutes of the Christian Religion. In 1950, after receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree from Hope College and a Master of Divinity from Western Theological Seminary, he was ordained by the Reformed Church in America. He soon entered the pastorate at one of the denomination's churches in Chicago, which over the next five years grew from 38 to 400 members. Then in 1955, he was sent to Orange County, Calif., to establish a church. After trying unsuccessfully to rent a facility, Schuller — with his wife Arvella as organist and $500 in assets — finally settled on a drive-in theater where he held Sunday services from a snack bar's roof. While attracting worshippers, Schuller gravitated toward the teachings of Peale, pastor of New York's Marble Collegiate Church, whom he credited with fine-tuning his faith and laying the foundation for the \"possibility thinking\" that was to come. His congregation grew steadily. By the 1970s, Schuller was a widely televised preacher whose Garden Grove Community Church in Orange County became a pioneering megachurch, and in the years ahead, he solicited New York architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee to design a modern cathedral. The result, a huge sanctuary with thousands of windows of reflective glass became known as the Crystal Cathedral and opened in 1980. With the exception of Disneyland, the church — which eventually drew more than 10,000 members — became the most famous architectural work in Orange County. In the late 1980s, reports of both Bakker's and Swaggart's misdeeds caused greater media scrutiny of televangelists — and their finances. Schuller was among them. A former employee accused him of deceiving followers in a fundraising letter. Then, in 1988, Schuller announced that his church was facing money shortages stemming from the \"shock waves\" echoing through American evangelism. \"That's what happens when you become high-profile.\" Still, by decade's end, the public esteem of Schuller, along with Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell, was far less affected than that of Bakker and Swaggart. In 1997, Schuller was again publicly shamed when an airline flight attendant sued Schuller and his church for more than $2.5 million for what he claimed were injuries sustained during a flight between Los Angeles and New York. The flight attendant said Schuller grabbed his shoulder and repeatedly shook him, causing physical and psychological damage. Schuller denied trying to hurt the man, but said he was only trying to get his attention. \"My actions were inappropriate, considering the circumstances, and wherever he might be I want him to know that I apologize for any portion of my conduct which he found offensive. … I am 70 years old, but I am not too old to learn or be taught new lessons.\" In the years ahead, Schuller's congregation still grew, with a $25 million structure built on the Crystal Cathedral complex in 1989. Celebrities and politicians — from Maya Angelou to Mikhail Gorbachev — visited Schuller's church. In 2003, Schuller opened a new visitors' center, the International Center for Possibility Thinking. Thousands of individuals were shaped by his message over the years, said Mouw, now a professor of faith and public life at Fuller, who mocked Schuller's \"possibility thinking\" when he first arrived at the seminary in the mid-1980s until several students asked him to stop. \"'That's how we became Christians,'\" the students told him. \"That's why we are in seminary because we were really touched by his ministry.' … These are people who have gone on to very solid ministries but they credit their initial sense of God's very personal presence in their life and their call for ministry to the influence of Robert Schuller.\" The Rev. Wes Granberg-Michaelson, general secretary emeritus of the Reformed Church in America, said Schuller was the most widely known minister of his denomination. \"As international television broadcasting opened up new markets, the 'Hour of Power' was often there, and watched by those — including church leaders, kings, generals, and prime ministers — who now had access to satellite TV,\" he said. \"While his actual ministry eventually crumbled in tragedy, the Cathedral — now Christ Cathedral — still stands, and is a testimony to Schuller's imaginative vision.\" After dealing with bankruptcy and his resignation, Schuller made occasional appearances at his daughter's church. When Schuller read Scripture at Coleman's church on Easter Sunday 2013, she recalled how he trained her as the family read the Bible around the table after dinner. \"More often than not, I'd just get started reading and Dad would say, 'Stop. Do it again, Sheila. This time with feeling,'\" she said, imitating her father's deep voice. \"So you can blame him if you think my messages have too much feeling.\" That Easter, he read from 1 Corinthians: \"Oh death, where is your sting? Oh Hades, where is your victory? Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Schuller is survived by five children and more than a dozen grandchildren. His wife Arvella died in 2014.

A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. \"Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,\" Mellado said, according to WSU News. \"She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life.\" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, \"She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home.\" She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to \"make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!\" Any additional funds raised will be \"paid forward\" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.\n"], "model_retrieved_documents": ["April 3, 2015 11:59 AM Facebook A few months ago, Bart the Zombie Cat took the internet by a storm when, after being hit by a car and buried, he clawed his way out of a grave. Now a one-year-old pit bull, unofficially dubbed \"the Miracle Dog,\" has made an equally miraculous recovery after getting hit by a car and then surviving an attack meant to end her life. The Associated Press reported Thursday (April 2) that the stray dog, later named Theia, lived off scraps from people and roamed the streets in a town 100 miles outside Spokane, Washington. About a month ago, Theia was struck by a car and reportedly hit on the head with a hammer. (WTF?!) She was then placed in a box and left in a ditch. (Seriously, what the actual f--k?) Theia climbed out of the ditch and hobbled to a nearby farm, where she was thankfully rescued. Sara Mellado, who owns the farm, gave the pit bull her current name. Theia was initially treated by veterinarians at Washington State University's Veterinary Teaching Hospital thanks to $700 from its Good Samaritan Fund. But the dog required intensive follow-up surgeries to repair her jaw and nasal passages, so Mellado ended up raising over $21,000 for the procedures on GoFundMe. Facebook Once Theia fully recovers, Mellado's family will find her a suitable permanent home. Until then, they're chronicling her progress on Facebook. Unlike with Bart the cat, Theia was a stray before the incident, so there's unlikely to be a contentious custody battle.

What a story. The year-old stray was badly injured in February when she was hit on a highway east of Spokane, Wash. Someone then attempted what The Spokesman-Review called \"a misguided mercy killing,\" hammering her head and leaving her for dead in a ditch. Days later, battered and sick, the bully breed mix escaped her roadside grave and made her way to a nearby farm in Moses Lake, tail wagging. Enter Sara Mellado, who came to the rescue after learning of the dog's ordeal on Facebook about a week later. Just two weeks before, she had to euthanize her nine-year-old German shepherd, so she was still in mourning and \"devastated,\" she told the Spokesman-Review. But she committed to providing a temporary home and helping this gentle, friendly dog she named Theia, who was known for hanging around a local trucking business. \"She was a shop dog. She was used to having people be around her all the time,\" Mellado said, noting that Theia bonded immediately with her 1-year-old daughter. \"She's a puppy. She's outgoing, lovable, up for meeting new people.\" Mellado started Theia's recovery by taking her to the local veterinary hospital. Theia had leg injuries, a dislocated jaw, a sinus cavity that had been caved in by the hammer blows. \"I'm assuming that the person who did this meant to put her out of her misery,\" Mellado told the Associated Press. After several trips to the Moses Lake Veterinary Hospital and Washington State University's Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Pullman, Theia still needs to repair the multiple fractures of her nasal bones, which have partially blocked her nasal passage and made breathing all but impossible. To offset the cost, Mellado started an online fundraising campaign with a $10,000 goal. By Wednesday afternoon, nearly $11,400 had been pledged, and Mellado announced that Theia's surgery is scheduled for April 22. Vets predict a full life for Theia, and Mellado said she's already been deluged with offers from people who want to adopt her. \"Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,\" Mellado told AP. \"She's a true miracle dog, and she deserves a good life.\"", "Instructions: Want to discuss?

SPOKANE, Wash. – The stray dog was hit by a car, clubbed in the head and left for dead in a ditch in Washington state. Days later, the 1-year-old bully breed mix showed up sickly and covered in dirt at a nearby farm. Now, the dog that defied death is recovering with the help of good Samaritans and veterinarians at Washington State University. The dog used to roam the streets getting scraps of food from people in Moses Lake, a farm town about 100 miles west of Spokane.

Then things got worse: Someone cracked her in the head with a hammer and placed her in a box in a farm field. But the dog somehow survived and was discovered at a nearby farm with a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity. The wounds helped veterinarians piece together what happened, including the hammer blow. “I’m assuming that the person who did this meant to put her out of her misery,” said Sara Mellado, who learned about the dog’s plight on Facebook and took the animal into her Moses Lake home.

A CT scan of her skull revealed a condition that constricts the nasal passages, restricting air flow into the lungs, said veterinary resident Andrea Sundholm, who’s assisting with Theia’s treatment. It was caused by multiple nasal bone fractures. When Theia tries to draw air in through her nose, she’s forced to open her mouth to breathe instead. But with a dislocated jaw, that is challenging as well. READ MORE: Inmates care for abandoned dogs in ‘Paroled Pups’ program Theia’s jaw is healing on its own, but the nasal-bone fractures have caused lasting problems, Sundholm said.

Mellado has raised another $10,000 for the surgery through a crowdfunding website, and is planning to call WSU to schedule the procedure. The university said despite her injuries, Theia is friendly and likes to kiss people’s cheeks. Mellado said she has been deluged with calls from people seeking to help.

He is the former Foreign Minister of Iran, known for his role in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). However, Zarif recently made headlines for a different reason - the release of leaked recordings that have sparked controversy and generated widespread discussion.\n\nThe leaked recordings, which surfaced on social media, feature Zarif speaking candidly about various political issues and sharing insights into Iran's foreign policy strategy. In the recordings, Zarif criticizes the influence that the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) holds over foreign policy decisions, calling it a \"government within a government.\"\n\nThese revelations have caused a stir both domestically and internationally, with many questioning the dynamics of power within Iran's political landscape. Zarif's comments have shed light on the internal tensions and power struggles that exist within the Iranian government, raising concerns about the extent of the IRGC's influence on key policy matters.\n\nThe leaked recordings have also led to speculation about Zarif's political future and whether he will face repercussions for his remarks. Some analysts believe that the release of the recordings was part of a deliberate effort to undermine Zarif's credibility and reputation, while others see it as a reflection of the complex and often opaque nature of Iranian politics.\n\nFor his part, Zarif has defended his statements, claiming that his comments were taken out of context and manipulated for political gain. He has reiterated his commitment to serving Iran's best interests and has vowed to continue his diplomatic efforts on behalf of the country.\n\nAs the fallout from the leaked recordings continues to unfold, one thing is clear - Mohammad Javad Zarif's outspoken revelations have opened a new chapter in Iran's political landscape, exposing the inner workings of the government and prompting a reevaluation of power dynamics within the country.", "token_usage": 381, "human_written_evidences": ["Mohammad Javad Zarif has spent more time with John Kerry than any other foreign minister. He once participated in a takeover of the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco.

He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six:. In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashanah,\" referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \"Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir.\" And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \"Iran never denied it,\" Zarif tweeted back. \"The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\" The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \"due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\" That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \"born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\" Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961. So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled \"Mr. Ambassador\" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.\n"], "model_retrieved_documents": ["About this rating On 28 July 2015, the web site of Allen B. West, a former one-term congressman and conservative pundit, published an article asserting that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had hidden a close familial connection to an Iranian official with whom he had negotiated a nuclear deal. According to that article (\"You will NOT BELIEVE who was best man at John Kerry's daughter's wedding\"), John Kerry concealed the information that his son-in-law was Iranian during the U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for his position as secretary of state. Moreover, throughout the negotiations over a deal limiting Iran's development of nuclear weapons, Kerry hid the fact that he was buddy-buddy with Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister whom he negotiated the nuclear deal — so much so that the best man at the wedding of Kerry's daughter was Zarif's son: You not might be aware that in 2009, the daughter of Secretary of State John Kerry, Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerry's younger daughter by his first wife, married an Iranian-American physician named Dr. Brian (Behrooz) Vala Nahed. Of course you're not aware of it. Brian (Behrooz) Nahed is son of Nooshin and Reza Vala Nahid of Los Angeles. Brian's Persian birth name is \"Behrooz Vala Nahid\" but it is now shortened and Americanized in the media to \"Brian Nahed.\" At the time his engagement to Bradford Kerry, there was rarely any mention of Nahed's Persian/Iranian ancestry, and even the official wedding announcement in the October 2009 issue of New York Times carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)'s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college years. Gosh, I wonder why?? Gee, do you think Secretary Kerry should have recused himself from the negotiations with Iran at the very outset because of his long-standing relationship to his Iranian counter-part, Mohammad Javad Zarif? Let me explain. Zarif is the current minister of foreign affairs in the Rouhani administration and has held various significant diplomatic and cabinet posts since the 1990s. He was Kerry's chief counterpart in the nuclear deal negotiations. Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry's daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif's son. Does this bother anyone at all? Apparently Kerry only revealed his daughter's marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of State. But the subject never came up in his Senate confirmation hearing, either because Kerry never disclosed it, or because his former colleagues were \"too polite\" to bring it up. As Front Page Magazine pointed out several months ago, the nuclear talks with Iran were a tragic farce, choreographed and orchestrated by Iran. And unfortunately, we're going to have to live with the consequences. At least, I hope we live. All of this information was wrong. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerry's daughter from his previous marriage to writer Julia Stimson Thorne (from whom he was divorced in 1988), married Brian Vala Nahed on 10 October 2009. Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he is an American-born U.S. citizen who attended school at UCLA and Yale and is currently a neurosurgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital (where his wife is also a physician specializing in critical care). This information has been plainly available for years in his official workplace biography on the Massachusetts General Hospital web site: Dr. Brian Nahed is a neurosurgeon who specializes in brain tumors (glioblastoma, gliomas [low grade and high grade], metastatic brain tumors, and meningiomas) as well as Spinal Disorders. Dr. Nahed's clinic interest are in tumors of the eloquent cortex requiring awake surgery, language and motor mapping, and subcortical stimulation. Born in New York, Dr. Nahed attended UCLA where he majored in Neuroscience, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and with the department's Highest Honors. He attended the Yale School of Medicine where he was awarded the Doris Duke Clinical Research Fellowship and graduated with honors. Dr. Nahed completed his internship and neurosurgery residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital; where Dr. Nahed also completed a postdoctoral fellowship with Drs. Daniel Haber and Shyamala Maheswaran in the MGH Cancer Center. Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he was not born in Iran, he has never held Iranian citizenship, he has never worked or lived in Iran, and he has never even been to Iran. He's a natural-born U.S. citizen from New York who has lived, attended school, and worked in the United States his whole life. More important, he is not close friends with either Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif or Zarif's son: he doesn't know either of them, and Zarif's son was not the best man at his wedding (nor, as some accounts report, was Zarif's son his college roommate). Vanessa Kerry herself verified to us that Zarif's son was not at her wedding: The small piece of information here that is true is that Brian Nahed's parents were themselves born in Iran. However, they permanently left that country to immigrate to the U.S. forty years ago, well before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and now live in Los Angeles (where Brian's father also works as a physician). As for the rest of the \"facts\" presented in the Westian article, they were nothing more than a collection of supposition and innuendo, such as the claim that John Kerry \"only revealed his daughter's marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of State\" in 2013. By the article's own admission, that marriage had been very publicly covered in wedding announcement published by the New York Times in 2009, one which used the full \"Persianized\" versions of Brian's parents' names — something hardly suggestive of the notion that the media were conspiring to cover up revelation of their ancestry: The bride, who is a stepdaughter of Teresa Heinz Kerry and Richard J. Charlesworth, and the bridegroom, a son of Nooshin P. Nahed and Dr. Reza M. Nahed of Los Angeles, were married Saturday evening at Brandegee House, a Tuscan-style villa in Boston. The Right Rev. M. Thomas Shaw, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, officiated. Dr. Kerry and Dr. Nahed, both 32, are residents at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She is in her third year of a residency in internal medicine; he is in his fifth year of a residency in neurological surgery. More absurdly, the article's statement that \"even the official [New York Times] wedding announcement carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)'s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college years\" was deliberately misleading and specious, as that wedding announcement also made no mention of the bride's birthplace and started her biography from her college years (which is in fact quite common in wedding announcements, especially those of people who have achieved significant accomplishments in adulthood). And it makes no logical sense whatsoever that anyone attempting to hide Brian Nahed's familial connection to Iran would \"carefully avoid any reference\" to his \"foreign\" birthplace of New York. Finally, the unsourced statement that \"Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise.\" is (even if true) little more than out-of-context innuendo intended to suggest some kind of close pre-negotiation friendship between the two figures without providing any actual evidence of it. Both men have an extensive history of political and diplomatic service to their countries over the last thirty years: Mohammad Javad Zarif lived in and was educated (up to the PhD level) in the United States, served as a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations (a position in which he met with a number of Washington politicians), has been a headline speaker at foreign policy conferences in the U.S. (attended by prominent Washington politicians), and has been Iran's minister of foreign affairs since 2013, while John Kerry served several terms in the U.S. Senate, was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, chaired the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, and has been U.S. Secretary of State since 2013. It's hardly a \"surprise\" to anyone the least bit familiar with the political world that two men who have long held high positions in their countries' national governments and been closely involved with foreign affairs might have crossed paths at some point prior to their first negotiation as their countries' official representatives.

He stated that it was \"stolen for clear reasons\".[10] On May 2, 2021, in an Instagram post, Zarif apologized for the remarks that he made against Soleimani.[11] In the tape, Zarif said former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told him that Israel attacked Iranian assets in Syria \"at least 200 times.\" Zarif said that he was astonished by the admission.[8][12][13][14] Kerry was not recorded speaking on the tape, and the date of the recording is unknown.[13][15] A posting on Iran International's website indicated that Zarif was taken aback, that it was not the IRGC who informed him about the Israeli strikes against Iran, but Kerry.[16] NBC reported that the leaked tape \"inflamed a debate raging in Iran over the nuclear deal\" with upcoming presidential elections. Also, its effects in the US where \"Republican opponents of nuclear diplomacy with Iran have seized on Zarif's account\".[17] On September 27, 2013, Kerry met with Zarif during the P5+1 and Iran summit, which eventually led to the JCPOA nuclear agreement. It was the highest-level direct contact between the United States and Iran in the last six years, and it made Kerry the first U.S. Secretary of State to have met with his Iranian counterpart since the 1979 Iranian Revolution.[18][19][20] In April 2021, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State Ned Price stated in a press briefing that he couldn't confirm the accuracy or authenticity of the Zarif audiotape or its claims, but implied that Kerry would not have likely been disclosing confidential information if it occurred. He stated that prior press reporting of Israeli attacks on Syria would have made the suspected call contents already part of the public record, making Kerry's alleged disclosures to Zarif as not confidential.[21] As CNN noted, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed in July 2017 that Israeli airstrikes had targeted Iranian-backed Hezbollah-bound convoys in Syria \"dozens of times\",[22][21] and in August 2017, Israeli Air Force chief Maj. Gen. Amir Eshel confirmed that Israel had attacked convoys bringing arms to Hezbollah several times over the past five years.[23][21] In 2018, Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz stated that \"in the last two years Israel has taken military action [against Iran] more than 200 times within Syria itself.\"[24][21] However, it is unclear whether Kerry allegedly revealed the Israeli operations to Zarif before or after Israel itself publicly reported them in 2018.[21][25] In May 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported that then-President Donald Trump said that Kerry “should be prosecuted” for meeting privately with Iranian officials.[26] Nineteen Republican senators signed a letter[27] asking President Joe Biden to investigate the Zarif claim, writing: \"We write to convey our grave concerns over U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry’s position as a member of your administration's National Security Council and his record – both past and present – of potentially working with America’s adversaries against our national security interests and those of our allies. We ask you to investigate recent allegations that Secretary Kerry revealed sensitive information to the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, and if true, call for his removal from your national security team.\"[28] Three Republican representatives, Ann Wagner, Andy Barr, and Lee Zeldin, sent a letter to Diana Shaw, the State Department's acting inspector general, asking for a full investigation into Zarif's claims. In the letter they wrote, “Given the gravity of the security threat Iran poses to U.S. and Israeli interests, we respectfully ask that you fully investigate these allegations...Iran is a serious threat to Israel, a bulwark of democracy and stability in the Middle East. It is in our national security interest to stand by our strategic ally - not sell it out to our adversaries”. The letter also requested that Shaw make a determination if Kerry should have his security clearance revoked.[29] The lawmakers inquired what role Kerry had in formulating the Biden administration's policy on re-entering the JCPOA. They also questioned whether the state department knew of any Iranian proxy “follow-on attacks” made against Israel after Kerry allegedly met with Zarif.[29] In May 2021, Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee requested documents from the White House regarding Kerry's security clearance. In the letter, signed by all but three Republicans on the panel, they questioned \"Kerry’s fitness to serve in his current role with the National Security Council\" and whether he should maintain a security clearance.[30] In a tweet,[31] Kerry denied Zarif's account, writing: “I can tell you that this story and these allegations are unequivocally false. This never happened — either when I was Secretary of State or since.”[15] Starting on April 27, 2021, some Republicans suggested that Kerry should resign from the Biden administration's National Security Council or were highly critical of Kerry's alleged disclosures. Other Republicans expressed uncertainty about the tape's veracity. In the tape, Zarif spoke about his relationship with Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by a United States drone strike in 2020.[9] Zarif said that \"by assassinating [Soleimani] in Iraq, the United States delivered a major blow to Iran, more damaging than if it had wiped out an entire city in an attack\".[3]", "Numerous websites have been reporting that John Kerry hid a close family connection to an Iranian official that he negotiated with over the infamous nuclear deal struck under President Obama. Is what they report true? Should Kerry have recused himself from the negotiating table? Or is there a false narrative underpinning it all… The claims: Most of the meat of the story comes down to John Kerry’s daughter, who she married, and who his now son-in-law was connected to in Iran. It is then asserted that Kerry hid this Iranian connection unlawfuly. ?? PHOTO: They Just Discovered Who Was At John Kerry’s Daughter’s Wedding… It Will Give You Chills http://t.co/rdxJHao1MT — All American Girl (@AIIAmericanGirI) July 29, 2015 @foxnation Although this came out (quietly) last year, John Kerry’s son-in-law is an Iranian, with family in Teheran, a conflict of interest — Dick Nelson (@RJLNelson) July 29, 2015 Who was best man at John Kerry’s daughter’s wedding ??…The Iranian’s son who he was making a nuclear deal with..and no one brings it up — anthony zumpano (@tonyzump) July 29, 2015 It is true, John Kerry’s daughter did marry an Iranian, but only of descent; he was born and raised in America. Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry married Dr. Brian Vala Nahed in 2009. The couple met as resident doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Nahed was born in New York. According to a New York Times announcement, the bridegroom graduated magna cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, and received his medical degree cum laude from Yale. His father, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine and critical-care physician, is the chief of staff at Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills, Calif. He also runs a private practice there, which is managed by the bridegroom’s mother. Who is the Iranian in question? Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, and one of the principal negotiators in nuclear talks with the U.S. The stories allege that Zarif was the best man at Kerry’s wedding, but there is no proof that this is true. The rumour started on Allen B. West’s – a former one-term congressman and conservative pundit – website in July 2015: “Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry’s daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif’s son.” An Iranian news agency called the report a “news fabrication” and said Zarif’s son wasn’t at the wedding. According to the report: “Officials at the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday strongly rejected some US media reports alleging that Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif’s son had attended the wedding ceremony of Vanessa Kerry, the daughter of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The foreign ministry’s denial came after several American websites claimed in the last few days that Zarif’s son, Mehdi Zarif, had not only attended the wedding party of Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry and her Iranian American husband doctor Brian Vala Nahed, but also been Vala Nahed’s best man. The report seems to have appeared on the US media not to hurt the Iranian foreign minister, but to damage Kerry’s credit and reputation as the Republicans and the Israeli lobbies have started massive propaganda to torpedo a recent nuclear deal struck between the six world powers and Iran. Only the powerful Israeli lobby group, AIPAC, has declared a 20 million dollar fund for the purpose. And the Vanessa-Brian story only seems to be the beginning.” The conclusion: Not only is Brian Nahed not Iranian, he wasn’t born in Iran, has never held Iranian citizenship, and has never even been to Iran. He is a natural-born US citizen who has lived, attended school, and worked in the US his whole life. Furthermore, he is not close friends with either Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif or Zarif’s son: he doesn’t know either of them, and Zarif’s son was not the best man at his wedding (nor, as some accounts report, was Zarif’s son his college roommate). Vanessa Kerry herself verified that Zarif’s son was not at her wedding: Persian Shrug http://t.co/BtnKMzXM27 via @po_st Happy 2 verify. No wedding party when we married. No Zarif’s son. Sorry 2 disappoint. — Vanessa Kerry (@VBKerry) August 2, 2015 The only bit of truth to the story is that Naded’s parents were indeed born in Iran, but they in face permanently left the country to immigrate to the US forty years ago. Photos touted of the event as proof do not even contain Zarif! It is true, however, that Kerry has a personal relationship with Zarif that predates the nuclear talks. The diplomats’ relationship was reported in a 2012 book by author Hooman Majd. Peter is a Philosophy graduate from the University of Bristol. He is from a diplomatic background and has lived throughout Europe, and is currently based in London. Globalo is a fresh new take on digital journalism.

CONNECT WITH OUR VISION TERMS & CONDITIONS GLOBALO", "Mohammad Javad Zarif has spent more time with John Kerry than any other foreign minister He once participated in a takeover of the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco The Iranian foreign minister tweets in English If you’ve been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran – if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero’s welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. “Long live Zarif,” crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is “polished” and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, “jovial.” An Internet search for “Mohammad Javad Zarif” and “jovial” yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: Iran/P5+1 Statement: \"The EU will TERMINATE the implementation of ALL nuclear-related economic and financial sanctions\". How about this? In September 2013, Zarif tweeted “Happy Rosh Hashanah,” referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: “Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran’s Holocaust denial, sir.” And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. “Iran never denied it,” Zarif tweeted back. “The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.” The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad’s successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that “due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.” That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master’s in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was “born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.” Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. Committed to start drafting the comprehensive nuclear deal immediately. All will be served by a serious agreement based on mutual respect. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif’s name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com – which cites Zarif’s memoirs, titled “Mr. Ambassador” – was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland. © 2023 Cable News Network.

He was the foreign minister of Iran from 2013 until 2021 in the government of Hassan Rouhani. During his tenure as foreign minister, he led the Iranian negotiation with P5+1 countries which produced the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on 14 July 2015,[6] lifting the economic sanctions against Iran on 16 January 2016.[7] On 25 February 2019, Zarif resigned from his post as foreign minister.[8] His resignation was rejected by Ali Khamenei and he continued as foreign minister. Before assuming his current position, he held various significant diplomatic and cabinet posts. He is a visiting professor at the School of International Relations and University of Tehran, teaching diplomacy and international organizations. He was the Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations from 2002 to 2007.[9] He served as an advisor and senior advisor to the Foreign Minister, Deputy Foreign Minister in Legal and International affairs, member of the UN Eminent Persons Group on Dialogue Among Civilizations, Head of the UN Disarmament Commission in New York, and Vice President for International Affairs of the Islamic Azad University.[10] Zarif was born in Tehran around 1960,[11][12] although other sources have given the year of birth as 1959[13] and 1961.[14] According to The New Republic, Zarif was born to an \"affluent, religiously devout and politically conservative merchant family in Tehran\". His father was one of the most well-known businessmen of Isfahan, and his mother Efat Kashani (d. 2013)[15] was the daughter of one of the most famous businessmen of Tehran. He was educated at the Alavi School, a private religious institution.[4] Zarif was shielded from TV, radio, and newspapers by his parents as a youth. There was only an alarm clock that played the Athan during prayers. Instead, he became exposed to revolutionary ideas by reading the books of Ali Shariati and Samad Behrangi.[4] At age 17, he left Iran for the United States. Zarif attended Drew College Preparatory School, a private college-preparatory high school located in San Francisco, California.[4] He went on to study at San Francisco State University, from which he gained a B.A. in 1981 and M.A. in 1982, both in international relations.[16] Following this, Zarif continued his studies at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, University of Denver, from which he obtained a second M.A. in international relations in 1984 and a Ph.D. in international law and policy in 1988.[17][18] His thesis was titled \"Self-Defense in International Law and Policy.\"[19] Tom Rowe, a professor at the graduate school who led the committee that oversaw Zarif's dissertation, said: \"He was among the very best students that I've ever taught.\"[20] Ved Nanda, who taught and was on Zarif's dissertation committee, recalled: \"[He was] good in the classroom. At that time ... I thought he'd play an important part in his country's life.\"[21] Zarif was appointed a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations in May 1982 – largely due to his English-speaking ability and relationships in America, rather than formal diplomatic training.[4] As a junior diplomat Zarif was involved in negotiations to win the release of U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian gunmen in Lebanon, according to the memoirs of former United Nations envoy Giandomenico Picco. Even though the United States did not make a promised reciprocal goodwill gesture at the time, Zarif remained committed to improving ties.[22] In 2000, Zarif served as chairman of the Asian preparatory meeting of the World Conference on Racism and as the chairman of the United Nations Disarmament Commission. Zarif was also professor of international law at the University of Tehran. He served as the vice president of Islamic Azad University in charge of foreign affairs from 2010 to 2012 under Abdollah Jasbi.[23] He has served on the board of editors of a number of scholarly journals, including the Iranian Journal of International Affairs and Iranian Foreign Policy, and has written extensively on disarmament, human rights, international law, and regional conflicts.[24] Zarif served as Iran's representative at the United Nations from 2002 to 2007.[16] He was closely linked with developing the so-called \"Grand Bargain,\" a plan to resolve outstanding issues between the U.S. and Iran in 2003.[25] Zarif, during his time at the UN, held private meetings with a number of Washington politicians, including the then-Senators Joseph Biden and Chuck Hagel.[25] He resigned from office on 6 July 2007.[26] He was succeeded by Mohammad Khazaee in the post.[27] In 2007, Zarif was a headline speaker at an American Iranian Council conference in New Brunswick, New Jersey including Chuck Hagel, Dennis Kucinich, Nicholas Kristof, and Anders Liden to discuss Iranian-American relations, and potential ways to increase dialogue and avoid conflict.[28] On 23 July 2013, it was reported that Zarif was Rouhani's choice for minister of foreign affairs. This was not confirmed by the president-elect's office until 4 August when Rouhani officially nominated Zarif for the position to the Iranian Parliament.[29] He was confirmed by the parliament with 232 votes, replacing Ali Akbar Salehi in the position.[30] Zarif welcomed the first visit by a foreign leader to Iran since Rouhani assumed the presidency ten days after his approval as Foreign Minister with the arrival of Oman's sultan, Qaboos bin Said Al Said. Stories spread that there was a secret agenda to his meetings with Iranian officials, involving claims that he came to convey messages from the United States and then to relay Iran's response to White House officials.[31] On 5 September 2013, in an exchange prompted by his Rosh Hashanah greeting on Twitter, Zarif said that Iran does not deny the Holocaust, distancing the government from the often belligerent stances by former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.[32] Genuineness of Zarif's tweeting in English was confirmed by CNN's Christiane Amanpour.[33] On 27 September 2013, he met with United States Secretary of State John Kerry during P5+1 and Iran summit. It was the highest-level direct contact between the United States and Iran in the last six years.[34][35] After the meeting, Kerry said that \"We had a constructive meeting, and I think all of us were pleased that Foreign Minister Zarif came and made a presentation to us, which was very different in tone and very different in the vision that he held out with respect to possibilities of the future.\"[36] After the breakup of talks on 12 November, Zarif rejected Kerry's claim that Iran had been unable to accept the deal \"at that particular moment\". He said \"no amount of spinning\" could change what had happened in Geneva, but it could \"further erode confidence\". Zarif appeared to blame France for \"gutting over half\" of a US draft deal. Representatives from Iran and the so-called P5+1 – met again on 20 November.[37] Talks between senior American, Iranian and European diplomats in October 2014 produced no breakthrough agreement on curbing Iran's nuclear program, but officials said they still aimed to reach a deal by the 24 November deadline. A senior State Department official characterized each step of progress in the talks as \"chipping away\" at complex, technical differences, with virtually every sentence requiring an appendix of further explanation. \"We continue to make progress, but there is still a substantial amount of work to be done,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the difficult and secretive negotiations.[38] Zarif and Kerry conferred, ahead of a fresh round of negotiations between Iran and six world powers in Geneva, on settling their 12-year standoff over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Lower-level negotiators on both sides met at the same venue on 15 January 2015 to iron out technical details ahead of negotiations 3 days later between Iran and the \"P5+1\" powers – the US, France, Germany, Russia, China and Britain. Speaking at a Tehran news conference, Zarif said the purpose of the talks with Kerry \"is to see if we can speed up and push the negotiations forward\".[39] In February, Zarif said that Iran did not favor another extension of the talks on limiting its nuclear program and expected economic sanctions to be quickly lifted if an accord was reached. At a security conference in Munich, he said \"Sanctions are a liability; you need to get rid of them if you want a solution.\" Of the long effort to forge an agreement, he said \"This is the opportunity to do it, and we need to seize this opportunity. It may not be repeated.\" The nuclear talks have already been extended twice and face a late March deadline for working out the main outlines of an accord. The deadline for a detailed agreement is the end of June.[40] Based on the Iran nuclear deal framework, which was declared on 2 April, Iran agreed to accept significant restrictions on its nuclear program for at least a decade and submit to international inspections under a framework deal. In return, international sanctions would be lifted; whether in phases or all at once still needed to be worked out. On 21 November it was reported by Iranian negotiators that progress was being made in talks in Geneva with world powers, expressing hope to bridge differences and sign an elusive deal over Tehran's nuclear drive. In statements carried by Iranian media after a one-hour meeting with Baroness Ashton, Zarif said \"Differences of opinion remain and we are negotiating over them. God willing we will reach a result.\"[41] Three days later, the Geneva interim agreement, officially titled the Joint Plan of Action,[42] was signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in Geneva, Switzerland. It consisted of a short-term freeze of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries worked toward a long-term agreement.[6] On 29 April 2015, while appearing on The Charlie Rose Show, Zarif was asked about the detention of Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post reporter held in Iran for the past nine months. He responded, \"We do not jail people for their opinions[.]\"[43] Zarif condemned U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, saying the United States should be held \"accountable for crimes against humanity\".[44] On 11 February 2019, Zarif met with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Nasrallah thanked Zarif for Iran's support of Hezbollah's fight against 'Zionist aggression', and Zarif affirmed his country's \"firm stance that supports Lebanon and its state, people and resistance\".[45] In an interview conducted by CBS News on 25 April 2019, Zarif said that he was the one who proposed Iran's prisoner swap proposal to the U.S. government in October 2018, the proposal having been unanswered by the U.S. side up until that time. He added that the U.S. government must prove its seriousness before any negotiations.[46][47][48] Zarif condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria viewing it as a violation of Syria's sovereignty.[49] However regarding the US withdrawal from Syria Zarif commented saying the US was an \"irrelevant occupier in Syria\", and said that Iran would be willing to mediate tensions between Syria and Turkey.[50] Zarif called the peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates a betrayal against Arab and non-Arab countries in the Middle East.[51] Zarif stepped down from his post on 25 February 2019, announcing his resignation on Instagram. After greetings in honor of Iranian Women's and Mothers' day, he wrote I am apologising [to] you (wholeheartedly) for my (inability to continue my service and any) shortcomings in the past years during my time as foreign minister... I thank the Iranian nation and officials. Zarif did not elaborate or provide any further explanation.[52][53] An aide said that one of the reasons for Zarif's resignation was anger over his exclusion that day from meetings with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who was visiting Tehran. Rouhani rejected Zarif's resignation two days later. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force, also rejected Zarif's resignation, with Soleimani remarking that Zarif is the \"main person in charge of foreign policy.\"[54] In July 2019 the United States imposed sanctions on Zarif, and he was identified by the US as an \"illegitimate spokesperson for Iran\".[55][56] In response, a spokesman for European Union diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini stated, \"We regret this decision.\"[57] On 25 April 2021, The New York Times published content from a leaked audiotape of a three-hour taped conversation between economist Saeed Laylaz and Zarif. The taped conversation was connected to an oral history project, \"In the Islamic Republic the military field rules,\" that documents the work of Iran's current administration.[58][59] The tape was obtained by the London-based news channel Iran International.[60] In the tape, which the Times refers to as \"extraordinary\" moments, Zarif criticizes Qasem Soleimani and Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)[61] and alleges that former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told him that Israel attacked Iranian assets in Syria \"at least 200 times.\"[62][58][63][64] Although the tape has not been authenticated, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman did not deny its validity.[61] Zarif is married and has a daughter who is an interior decorator and a son who is a marketing consultant, both of whom were born in the United States.[32][21] He met his wife in summer 1979 through his sister. They married in Iran but moved to New York within several weeks in the midst of the Iranian revolution.[4] In addition to his native Persian, he is also fluent in English. Zarif has gained a domestic reputation and popularity among the people.[74][75] His \"Never threaten an Iranian!\" remark, during the heated nuclear negotiations, gained attention from global news agencies.[76][77][78] According to a poll conducted by Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC (iPOS) in March 2016, Zarif was the most popular political figure in Iran with 76% approval and 7% disapproval ratings.[79]", "Edited By: Ahona Sengupta PTI Last Updated: July 24, 2018, 07:28 IST Iran Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif . (Image: Reuters) Tehran: Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hit back today at threats from US President Donald Trump on Twitter, warning him to \"BE CAUTIOUS!\" Mimicking Trump's bellicose Twitter threat directed at Iran's leaders, Zarif wrote: \"UNIMPRESSED ... We've been around for millennia & seen fall of empires, incl our own, which lasted more than the life of some countries. BE CAUTIOUS!\" Zarif was responding to Trump's tweet yesterday, in which he warned: \"NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.\" That was assumed to be a response to a speech by President Hassan Rouhani earlier in the day warning Washington not to \"play with the lion's tail\" and that conflict with Iran would be the \"mother of all wars\". \"The world heard even harsher bluster a few months ago,\" Zarif said of Trump's tweet. \"And Iranians have heard them — albeit more civilised ones — for 40 yrs.\"", "Let our global subject matter experts broaden your perspective with timely insights and opinions you can’t find anywhere else.

Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif claimed in recently leaked audio that John Kerry, when he was serving as Secretary of State during the Obama administration, informed him of more than 200 Israeli operations in Syria. Kerry has previously been accused of colluding with Iranian leaders to undermine the Trump administration. Kerry is now a part of the Biden administration and has a seat on the National Security Council as the special presidential envoy for climate. Kerry shocked Zarif by revealing that Israel had attacked Iranian targets in Syria more than 200 times, according to leaked audio obtained by The New York Times and other outlets. Zarif also spoke frankly about his limited power compared to Ayatollah Ali Khameini and the blow the U.S. dealt to Iran by killing Gen. Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. IRAN’S TOP DIPLOMAT, IN LEAKED RECORDING, OFFERS BLUNT COMMENTS ABOUT RUSSIA, SOLEIMANI Kerry faced criticism on Monday over Zarif's claim. \"John Kerry was ratting out Israeli covert operations in Syria directly to the Iranian foreign minister. Let that sink in. Wow,\" Noah Pollak of the foreign policy-focused Democratic Alliance Group wrote on Twitter. Former special advisor for Iran at the State Department Gabriel Noronha weighed in on Zarif's lasting political career, despite his differences with others in Iranian governnment. \"The main reason Zarif has survived as Foreign Minister for 8 years in Iran’s cutthroat political environment is that he serves as the ‘reasonable’ storefront to the world, protecting the more empowered radical elements of the regime from Western and press scrutiny,\" Noronha said in a statement.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) \"Most of the time, Zarif’s Foreign Ministry is relegated to the job of the marketing and PR team, justifying and defending the policy choices of the IRGC and Supreme Leader Khamenei abroad,\" he continued. \"I think the leak was likely instigated by regime insiders who have long hated Zarif and tried to oust him — they oppose current efforts to rejoin the JCPOA and also want to bolster domestic opposition to President Rouhani and his allies running for office in June.\" The release of the comments by Zarif set off a firestorm within Iran, where officials carefully mind their words amid a cutthroat political environment that includes the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, ultimately overseen by the country's supreme leader. Zarif has been suggested as a possible candidate for Iran's June 18 presidential election as well.

(AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) Outside of Iran, Zarif's comments could also affect talks in Vienna aimed at finding a way for Tehran and the U.S. to both come into compliance with Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Already, sabotage targeted Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz during the talks as Tehran has begun enriching a small amount of uranium up to 60% purity, which edges the country closer to weapons-grade levels. After the leak became public, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh did not dispute the tape's authenticity. He told journalists on Monday that the recording represented just a portion of a seven-hour interview Zarif gave to a well-known economist that was to be held for posterity by a think tank associated with the Iranian presidency. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Khatibzadeh called the release of the recording \"illegal\" and described it as \"selectively\" edited, though he and others did not offer opinions on how it became public. Zarif, visiting Iraq on Monday after a trip to Qatar, took no questions from journalists after giving a brief statement in Baghdad.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.", "Iran welcomed the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan while it also scrambled to deal with the sudden influx of thousands of refugees along the 572-mile border. For months, Iran had been positioning itself for the transition by hosting a Taliban delegation in January and intra-Afghan peace talks in July. In August, Iran’s new president, Ebrahim Raisi, hailed the U.S. withdrawal as “an opportunity to restore life, security and durable peace.” But Iran also appeared to be caught off-guard by the Taliban’s sweeping takeover and the rapid collapse of the Afghan army. Iran “is concerned over the escalating violence in Afghanistan, and in light of the Taliban taking control of Herat, calls for guarantees of complete safety for its diplomatic missions and the lives of its staff,” Foreign Ministry Spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh tweeted on August 13. Iran has a strategic interest in Afghanistan, regardless of who is in power. The chaotic aftermath of the Taliban’s takeover held the potential to undermine Tehran’s long-term concerns, including stemming the flow of migrants and refugees, containing narcotics trafficking, maintaining cross-border trade, sharing water resources, ensuring the safety of the Shiite minority, and mitigating the threat from ISIS-Khorasan. Refugees and migrants: Iran has absorbed millions of refugees since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Afghans have also historically sought seasonal work in Iran. Remittance payments, primarily from undocumented Afghan men, have long been an important part of Afghanistan’s cash-strapped economy. As of 2020, Iran hosted some 950,000 documented Afghan refugees and at least 2 million more undocumented Afghans. But Iran has repeatedly tried to expel undocumented Afghans. In the first seven months of 2021, Iran deported more than 360,000 Afghans, according to the U.N. migration agency. Narcotics trafficking: Iran has blamed the Afghan government and its Western allies for failing to crack down on opium production and drug smuggling. Since 1998, Afghanistan has been the world’s top opiate producer. It supplies some 80 percent of the world’s opium, much of which is smuggled to Iran and on to Europe. Between 1979 and 2014, Iran claims to have lost some 4,000 security forces fighting heavily armed drug traffickers along its eastern border. Drug use is a growing domestic problem for Iran too. As of 2020, some 2.8 million Iranians were regular drug users in a population of 84 million. Another 1.6 million were recreational users. Cross-border trade: Since 2001, Iran has sought to increase exports to landlocked Afghanistan. Iran also views Afghanistan as a transportation route to expand economic ties with Central and South Asian countries. In 2017, Iran surpassed Pakistan as Afghanistan’s top trade partner. Trade has largely been one-way. In 2019, Iranian exports—including electricity, oil, cement, machinery, metal products, pharmaceuticals, wheat, fabrics and edible oils—totaled $1.24 billion. But Afghan exports to Iran –including fruit, nuts, carpets, cotton and wool – amounted to only $15 million. Between March and June 2021, 11 percent of Iran’s non-oil exports went to Afghanistan. Water resources: For decades, Iran and Afghanistan have disputed how to share water resources. The Helmand River flows from the mountains of the Hindu Kush through Afghanistan into southeastern Iran, where it is critical for agriculture, fishing and human consumption. The problem in modern times dates to the 1940s and 1950s, when Afghanistan built two dams—the Kajaki and the Grishk—on the Helmand River that could curtail water flow into Iran. In 1973, the two countries signed a treaty on sharing water resources, which focused heavily on distribution of water from Helmand River, but the accord was neither ratified nor implemented. Subsequent Afghan governments, including the Taliban, built, repaired or upgraded dams on the Helmand. From 1998 to 2001, the Taliban closed the sluices of the Kajaki Dam, cutting off water to Iran during a drought. In 2021, Afghanistan inaugurated another dam, the Kamal Khan, on the Helmand. Amnesty International says Taliban fighters recently tortured and killed members of an ethnic minority in Afghanistan, fueling fears that they will again impose a brutal rule. https://t.co/tSvLOITUK4 The Shiite minority: Iran has long supported the Hazaras, a historically oppressed ethnic minority who make up between 10 percent and 20 percent of Afghanistan’s population. Most Hazaras, like most Iranians, are Shiite. They also speak a dialect of Persian. When the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan, it carried out waves of mass killings of Hazaras in 1998, 2000 and 2001. After the Taliban fell, Iran cultivated influence among the Hazaras by funding cultural and religious activities as well as local media. In 2013, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) began recruiting Hazaras to fight in the new Fatemiyoun militia on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al Assad, a key ally of Iran. Over the next four years, the IRGC deployed to Syria up to 50,000 Afghans, mostly refugees who were living in Iran. The Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K): Iran has been deeply concerned about the Afghan branch of the Islamic State that emerged in 2015. ISIS-K considers Shiites apostates and has targeted them in Afghanistan. In 2020, ISIS-K gunmen allegedly killed 16 people, including infants, at a maternity hospital in a mostly Hazara neighborhood in Kabul. In December 2020, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested that the Afghan government consider regrouping Fatemiyoun fighters for the fight against ISIS-K. Iran has long supported efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. Tehran was a key player during the Bonn talks, the international diplomacy to form a new government after the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance toppled the Taliban government in 2001. The Iranian delegation, headed by then-Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, made two particularly important contributions, according to James Dobbins, the U.S. envoy. First, Iranian diplomats suggested that the Bonn agreement require the new Afghan government to commit to holding democratic elections and fighting terrorism, items that were omitted in the initial draft. Second, Zarif persuaded the Northern Alliance to give up several ministries, paving the way for the formation of Hamid Karzai’s government. Iran has also invested heavily in the economic development of its eastern neighbor, the seventh poorest country in the world. At the 2002 Afghanistan Recovery and Reconstruction Conference in Tokyo, Iran pledged $560 million over five years. Iran pledged another $100 million at the 2006 London Conference. Iran helped construct roads, railways, schools, energy and water infrastructure, especially in central and northern Afghanistan. In 2011, Iran announced that it had spent $600 million on infrastructure alone. Iran funded construction of the first railway link between the two countries, a 90-mile (140 kilometer) line from Khaf in northeastern Iran to Ghoryan in western Afghanistan. The line, inaugurated in 2020, is designed to eventually extend another 53 miles to Herat, Afghanistan’s third largest city. Much of Iran’s investment has been focused in and around Herat. For centuries, the city has been in Iran’s cultural sphere of influence. It was ruled by the Iranian Safavid dynasty from 1507 to 1716. The Iranian Qajar dynasty only relinquished its claim to Herat after losing to the British in the Anglo-Persian war of 1856-57. Iran has reprised its mediator role since Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced a road map for potential peace talks with the Taliban in November 2018. On December 26, 2018, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), visited Kabul to meet with Afghan officials. He announced that Iran had been holding talks with the Taliban in coordination with the Afghan government. Four days later, a Taliban delegation visited Tehran for talks. “Since the Islamic Republic of Iran is a powerful neighbor of Afghanistan, we should discuss the future of our country with Tehran in order to take positive steps towards strengthening friendship and peace on both sides,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told the Iranian Labour News Agency in January 2019. Iran hosted more Taliban delegations in September 2019, November 2019, January 2021 and July 2021. Iran, a predominantly Shiite country, opposed the Taliban, a Sunni movement far more rigid in its strict application of Islamic law, when it ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. In 1998, tensions between Iran and the Taliban almost escalated into war after eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist were killed by Taliban militants in northern Mazar-i-Sharif. When the Iranian nationals went missing, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the “worthless and lowly” Taliban had “no understanding of Islam or politics.” But since at least 2007, the Islamic Republic has tried to navigate a policy that includes outreach to both the elected Afghan government and the Taliban. Iran covertly armed, trained and funded the Taliban while engaging with Kabul. Tehran provided the Taliban with small arms, explosives, mortars, RPGs, heavy machine guns, and rockets, according to the Pentagon. In 2015, a Taliban delegation led by Muhammad Tayyab Agha, the head of the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, visited Tehran for talks on Afghanistan and regional issues. The Taliban acknowledged that its officials had visited Iran before. In 2016, Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour secretly visited Iran for talks; he was killed in a U.S. drone strike as he returned to Pakistan. In 2019, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessed that Tehran did not want to return the Taliban to power but aimed to “maintain influence with the group as a hedge in the event that the Taliban gains a role in a future Afghan government.” In August 2021, the Taliban took Kabul and pledged to form an inclusive government. The following is a timeline of key developments since the U.S. military withdrew from Bagram Airfield on July 2. July 7-8: In Tehran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hosted peace talks with Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the Taliban’s chief negotiator, and former Vice President Younus Qanooni, representing the Kabul government. Zarif urged them to “take difficult decisions today for the future of their country.” Iran was “ready to assist the dialogue” and to “resolve the current conflicts in the country” following the “failure of the U.S. in Afghanistan,” he said. Zarif subsequently tweeted that the meeting had been “cordial” and promised Iran would stand with Afghans on their road to peace. After further talks on July 8, the two sides released a joint statement condemning attacks on civilians and public institutions. They agreed that “war is not the solution to the Afghanistan problem.” Iran has deployed its 65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade (NOHED) in Taibad along the Afghan border amid Taliban's seizure of border crossings pic.twitter.com/9t9WfcdbCx July 9: The Taliban seized Islam Qala, a major border crossing between Iran and Afghanistan. The crossing had reportedly generated some $20 million in monthly revenue for the Afghan government. Videos circulated of Taliban fighters removing the Afghan flag from the border crossing. July 15-16: Rasoul Mousavi, the head of the west Asia department in Iran’s foreign ministry, visited Kabul for talks with senior Afghan government officials, including Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation. “Iran supports putting an end to the situation in Afghanistan and resolving the crisis through dialogue,” Mousavi told Abdullah. “Opportunities pass like clouds. The opportunity of peace must be taken today, not tomorrow, as it might be late,” Mousavi tweeted on his way back to Iran on July 17. Aug. 1: Iran’s embassy in Kabul urged Iranians outside of the capital to leave Afghanistan. “It is recommended to the nationals of the Islamic Republic of Iran who live or do business in Afghan districts and cities other than the city of Kabul to immediately leave the Afghan territory,” the embassy said in a statement following reports of Taliban attacks on an airport in Kandahar. Aug. 5: Iran reportedly allowed some Afghans with legal documents, including government officials and their families, to enter via a crossing with Afghanistan’s Nimruz province. But undocumented Afghans were reportedly turned away.

He says they’ve taken refuge in Iran and we don’t return them by force. pic.twitter.com/6FNHmlntS0 Aug. 8: Foreign Minister Zarif hosted Jean Arnault, the U.N. secretary general’s special envoy on Afghanistan, in Tehran. They agreed that intra-Afghan talks were the best way to stem the violence. “The international community must take an unequivocal stance in support of the political settlement for the crisis in Afghanistan and also condemn violence and its consequences,” Zarif said. He also blamed foreign powers for the chaos in Afghanistan. Arnault said that Iran and other countries in the region could play a key role in supporting the peace process. Iran’s special envoy for Afghanistan, Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, reiterated Tehran’s support for intra-Afghan talks during a phone call with Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation. In a video circulated on social media, Iranian border guards refused to hand over Afghan army troops to the Taliban. Aug. 9: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Khatibzadeh said that Iran was in contact with the Taliban regarding border security. “There have been occasional developments at our borders, but the borders have been calm during this period with the efforts of the border guards and the courageous Army forces, Khatibzadeh said. “We have tried to send the message that Iran’s borders must remain calm.” Aug. 10: Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar hosted Iran’s special envoy, Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, in Kabul to discuss Tehran’s role in facilitating peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. Aug. 11: Iran and Afghanistan continued cross-border trade despite the chaotic security situation, according to Iran's customs administration. “The story about a full halt to the trade with Afghanistan is a rumor,” Ruhollah Latifi, a spokesperson, said. But he conceded that exports through the Milak border crossing in Sistan and Baluchistan province had stopped. Aug. 12: State-run IRNA reported that Iran was temporarily closing its consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif amid escalating violence in the city. Foreign ministry official Rasoul Mousavi confirmed that Iranian diplomats in Herat were secure and that he had made contact after Taliban forces reportedly seized the consulate. In a tweet, he referred to the Taliban as the \"Islamic Emirate,\" the group's preferred name. Aug. 13: In a tweet, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Khatibzadeh urged the Taliban to ensure the “complete safety and health of diplomats and diplomatic facilities” in Herat. Major General Hossein Salami, the commander of the IRGC, told reporters that Iranian forces had secured the eastern border. “People should not worry at all, because the scope of our observations has gone beyond the borders and we are monitoring and controlling all the developments in the neighboring country.” Aug. 14: Former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed that a senior security official instructed him not to talk about the Taliban. The Taliban is a “serious threat to our security and the region,” he said in a video posted to social media platform Telegram. Aug. 15: Iran prepared accommodations for Afghan refugees in three border provinces -- Razavi Khorasan, South Khorasan, and Sistan and Baluchestan provinces. But Iran expected Afghan refugees to “return home when the situation improves in Afghanistan,” Hossein Ghasemi, the head of the Interior Ministry’s office of border affairs, told IRNA news agency. Foreign Minister Zarif welcomed former Afghan President Karzai’s announcement of a Coordination Council of senior Afghan leaders to meet the Taliban and manage the transition. “We hope that it can lead to dialogue,” Zarif tweeted. “Iran stands ready to continue its peacemaking efforts.” Afghans in Tehran, Mashhad, and Qom protested the Taliban takeover of Kabul. Hundreds of Afghans stood outside the Afghan embassy chanting “Death to Pakistan, Death to the Taliban.” Aug. 16: President Ebrahim Raisi said that the U.S. “military failure” in Afghanistan could pave the way for peace. “America’s military defeat and its withdrawal must become an opportunity to restore life, security, and durable peace in Afghanistan. Iran backs efforts to restore stability in Afghanistan and, as a neighboring and brother nation, Iran invites all groups in Afghanistan to reach a national agreement.” Foreign Minister Zarif was reporting directly to Raisi on developments in Afghanistan, Amwaj.media reported. The outgoing diplomat was expected to be replaced by Raisi’s nominee, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. A group of Afghan women gathered near the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh in Qom to protest the Taliban's takeover. Aug. 17: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Khatibzadeh said that Iran’s embassy in Kabul was open, although the number of staff had been reduced. He added that the consulate in Herat was also open. “Our diplomats are safe and have no problem traveling to Iran, but for safety reasons, they have preferred to remain in the mission for the time being.” A prominent Sunni cleric in Iran, Maulvi Abdul Hamid Ismailzehi released a statement congratulating the Taliban. “The great and remarkable victory of the Taliban, which was a result of jihad, martyrdom and patience in the cause of truth against the aggressor occupiers tand the failed, inefficient and corrupt government, for the Islamic Emirate,” he said on his website. “Congratulations to the honorable scholars and general public of the zealous and struggling nation of Afghanistan.” Afghans in Isfahan, a city in central Iran, demonstrated against the Taliban takeover. They called the Taliban “enemies” and criticized Afghan President Ashraf Ghani for fleeing the country. Aug. 18: Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, welcomed the U.S. departure from Afghanistan and said that Israel would eventually follow suit by withdrawing from territory claimed by Palestinians. “The end of any occupation is a humiliating dismissal. The fate that befell the United States in Vietnam, #Afghanistan and Iraq is also the inevitable fate of the occupying Zionist regime,” he tweeted. Mohammad Reza Naghdi, the IRGC’s deputy director of cultural and social affairs, also hailed the withdrawal. “The result of resisting against a great power is victory,” he told Sepah News. The U.S. withdrawal “does not require complex analysis, just as we saw the failure of the British and Soviet Union empires in Afghanistan lead to the collapse of those powers.” In a tweet, Foreign Minister Zarif criticized the 20-year involvement of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. “They invaded & occupied Afghanistan & elsewhere ONLY to pursue their own interests—but couldn't even achieve that.” The director of the Interior Ministry’s office of border affairs, Hossein Ghasemi, told local media that he had instructed border guards to turn away Afghan refugees to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Another Interior Ministry official, Mehdi Mahmoudi, the Director General of Citizens and Foreign Immigrants, said that Iran was not establishing refugee camps for Afghans. “We feel that there is no such space to come to Iran,” Mahmoudi told the Iranian Student News Agency.

Aug. 23: Iran’s Oil, Gas and Petrochemical Products Exporters Union said that it had resumed exports of gasoline and gasoil to Afghanistan in response to a Taliban request.

He was 99. “It is with profound sadness that we announce that the World’s Greatest MC who ever lived, Bob Barker has left us,\" Barker's publicist Roger Neal said in a statement. Born on December 12, 1923, in Darrington, Washington, Barker worked part-time in radio while in college and was given his own radio series in 1950, The Bob Barker Show, which ran for six years. He began his game show career in 1956, hosting Truth or Consequences. His stint lasted 19 years.

In 2006, he announced his pending retirement and officially exited The Price Is Right on June 15 2007 after 35 years. Barker did, however, return three times, once to promote his autobiography, Priceless Memories, and another in 2013 to celebrate his 90th birthday. Barker, additionally, made his first – and only – feature film role in the 1996 Adam Sandler movie Happy Gilmore. And he made the rounds on television, guest-starring as himself in comedies The Nanny, Something So Right, How I Met Your Mother and Yes, Dear, and lending his voice in the animated Futurama and Family Guy.

In 2007, he retired from hosting The Price Is Right after celebrating his 50-year career on television. In the years after his retirement, Barker continued to make occasional public appearances from 2009 to 2017. “Bob's influence on the entertainment industry is indisputable, but what mattered to him most was using his voice and prominent position to protect animals,” said PETA President Ingrid Newkirk in a statement. “Of course, everyone is familiar with his ‘spay and neuter your pets’ sign-off on The Price Is Right — a show where he refused to allow fur prizes —but he was also one of the first stars to go vegetarian, more than 30 years ago. He joined PETA in urging families to stay away from SeaWorld, demanded the closure of cruel bear pits masquerading as tourist attractions, implored Hollywood to take action to protect animals used in film and TV, and, as a Navy veteran, called for the end of military medical drills on live animals.” “His generous donation allowed PETA to open its West Coast headquarters, the Bob Barker building, in 2012, and it stands as a testament to his legacy and profound commitment to making the world a kinder place,” she added. “To us — and to so many animals around the world — Bob will always be a national animal rights treasure.” Barker was a 19-time Daytime Emmy award-winner: 14 for Outstanding Game Show Host for The Price Is Right and four “Outstanding Game Show” awards as the show’s executive producer. He has also been named in the Guinness Book of World Records as television's \"Most Durable Performer” (at 3,524 shows), and \"Most Generous Host in Television history\" (for awarding $55 million in prizes on his various shows). “We lost a beloved member of the CBS family today with the passing of Bob Barker,” said CBS in a statement. “During his 35 years as host of The Price Is Right, Bob made countless people’s dreams come true and everyone feel like a winner when they were called to ‘come on down.’ In addition to his legendary 50-year career in broadcasting, Bob will be remembered as a dedicated animal rights activist.

The silver-haired Barker, host of “The Price Is Right” from 1972 to 2007, won 19 Daytime Emmy awards, the top U.S. television honour, and also was known for a memorable comic turn playing himself in the hit 1996 film “Happy Gilmore,” beating up a character played by Adam Sandler. Barker died on Saturday morning of natural causes at his long-time Hollywood Hills, California, home, his publicist Roger Neal said. Barker gave millions of dollars to pro-animal causes, including donating $5 million for a 1,200-ton ship named the Bob Barker that was operated by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society to stop Japanese whaling ships from killing whales off Antarctica. From the archives: Bob Barker giving $50,000 to Manitoba couple to rehabilitate bears “The Price Is Right,” in which contestants tried to guess the price of various consumer products and played a slew of games to win prizes, became a U.S. pop culture institution on daytime TV with the smooth-talking Barker at the helm for 6,586 episodes. A studio announcer would bray “Come on down!” as one by one excited contestants would trot out of a studio audience down to the stage. Exuberant contestants occasionally would bear-hug and even tackle Barker.

In all, he taped more than 5,000 shows in his career. “I think TV hosts are like pies and some people like apple and some cherry and some chocolate,” Barker told the Hartford Courant in 2009. “I’m just very fortunate that they liked me well enough to invite me into their homes for 50 years.” Host Bob Barker answers questions on stage at a news conference after the taping of his final episode of the game show \"The Price Is Right\" in Los Angeles on June 6, 2007.Fred Prouser/Reuters “The Price Is Right” became the longest-running game show on U.S. television. Barker returned to the show in 2013 to mark his 90th birthday and again in 2015 for an April Fools’ Day episode. CBS said in a statement on Saturday that daytime television has lost one of its “most iconic stars.” “We lost a beloved member of the CBS family today with the passing of Bob Barker. During his 35 years as host of THE PRICE IS RIGHT, Bob made countless people’s dreams come true and everyone feel like a winner when they were called to ‘come on down.’ In addition to his legendary 50-year career in broadcasting, Bob will be remembered as a dedicated animal rights activist.” From the archives: Bob Barker, a pioneer of videotape, marks its 60th year Barker was known for pro-animal causes and campaigned for them into his 90s. He would end episodes of “The Price Is Right” by urging viewers to get their pets spayed and neutered to control the animal population and began a foundation to subsidize the practices. He also spoke out against the treatment of animals in zoos, rodeos and circuses. Barker stopped eating meat in 1979. His hair abruptly became silver when he quit using hair dye because it is tested on animals. In 1987, Barker quit as long-time host of the Miss USA and Miss Universe beauty pageants when pageant officials refused to stop draping contestants in fur coats.

Barker criticized poultry producer Foster Farms after an animal-rights group released videos showing cruel treatment of chickens.Amanda Lee Myers/The Associated Press Among his activities on behalf of animals was a $250,000 donation to Save the Chimps, the Fort Pierce, Florida-based organization said in an emailed statement Saturday. “Bob Barker’s kind spirit lives on at Save the Chimps, where we walk every day on the road named for him after his game-changing contribution,” said Save the Chimps’ CEO Ana Paula Tavares. At the time of the donation, Barker said that he hoped chimpanzees tortured “physically and mentally” for years when being used for research experiments would find “the first peace, contentment and love they have ever known at Save the Chimps.” From the archives: Bob Barker fails to sway Ontario on abandoning spring bear hunt In the film “Happy Gilmore,” Barker played himself in a memorable scene in which he was playing in a golf pro-am tournament with Sandler’s character, an excitable failed hockey player turned golfer. The two come to blows in a wild, extended comic brawl that ended with Barker thrashing Sandler. They staged another fight for a promotional video in 2015 when Barker, who studied karate with tough-guy actor Chuck Norris, was 91. In 1994, a woman who worked as a model on “The Price is Right” sued him for sexual harassment but Barker said it was a consensual intimate relationship. The suit later was dropped. Barker, born on Dec. 12, 1923, in Darrington, Washington, began his career in radio. In 1956, he was hired to host a TV version of the radio quiz show “Truth or Consequences” on NBC, and stayed with the program until 1975. Even before his stint on that show wrapped up, Barker began hosting “The Price Is Right” on CBS. In a 1996 interview with The Associated Press, Barker recalled receiving the news that he had been hired to host “Truth or Consequences”: “I know exactly where I was, I know exactly how I felt: I hung up the phone and said to my wife, ‘Dorothy Jo, I got it!’” Barker did not remarry after his wife, Dorothy, died of cancer in 1981.

Andrew Saunders, President and CEO", "“The Price is Right” is saying goodbye to the game show’s home of 51 years. “We’re about to film the very last episode of ‘The Price is Right’ at the Bob Barker Studio at Television City in California,” host Drew Carey said in a video posted to the show’s Instagram account last week. Monday’s episode will mark the CBS game show’s final spin on the storied stage before production begins at a new studio in the Northeast Los Angeles neighborhood of Glendale. “I used to tell people there was magic in the wood here because of all the good vibes that have been in this studio, all the laughs and all the fun that have been here,” Carey continued to say in the video, adding that now they have to “put our own good vibes into that new place.” Carey said that Monday’s farewell show will be historic, and announcer George Gray teased the episode would “tip our hat to this amazing stage.” History is certainly in the walls of Barker’s studio, which previously was the production home of “The Carol Burnett Show,” “Jack Benny,” and other shows. “The Price is Right” first hit the air in 1972 and has since become television’s longest-running game show. The lively program invites audience members on stage to try to win cash and prizes. Legendary television personality Barker hosted the show for 35 years before stepping down in 2007. The stage was named after him in 1998. Carey took over as host following Barker’s exit, something he said in the video that he’s “blessed” to do. “I always am grateful and thankful that I have this opportunity to have a job like this,” Carey added, later saying hosting the show is “just the best feeling in the world.” The final episode of “The Price is Right” recorded in its original studio airs Monday night on CBS. © 2023 Cable News Network.

The historic California drought hurts the rest of the nation as well, with far-reaching consequences that impact not only agriculture and water resources, but also the economy and environment.\n\nCalifornia's severe water shortage, brought on by a combination of persistent dry conditions and dwindling snowpack levels, has led to crippling effects on the state's agriculture industry. Farmers have been forced to fallow land, reduce crop production, and implement costly irrigation practices to conserve water. This has not only resulted in financial losses for farmers but has also driven up food prices across the country due to reduced supply.\n\nBeyond agriculture, the drought has also strained water resources for residents of California, leading to water restrictions, increased water bills, and concerns about the long-term sustainability of water supplies. Urban areas have been hit hard, with cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco implementing conservation measures to cope with the dwindling water reserves.\n\nThe environmental impact of the drought is also significant, with ecosystems suffering from reduced water availability and increased wildfires due to dry conditions. Wildlife habitats are at risk, and native species are facing challenges in finding adequate food and water sources.\n\nIn addition to these immediate effects, the California drought has broader implications for the nation's economy. California is a major producer of fruits, vegetables, and nuts, and the drought-related crop losses have ripple effects on the food industry and supply chain. Lower crop yields lead to higher prices for consumers and could potentially impact food security on a national level.\n\nAs climate change continues to exacerbate drought conditions in California and beyond, it is clear that the problem extends far beyond state borders.

Perhaps the only good thing is another \"great\" wine grape harvest last year.\n"], "reference_documents": ["Los Angeles (CNN)It's more than just one state's internal problem. The historic California drought hurts the rest of the union, too. That's because California is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. Here's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state, a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted Gov. Jerry Brown to announce a mandatory 25% cutback in water consumption in all cities. In 2014, one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the California drought. He was often right, according to statistics gathered by Timothy Richards, agribusiness professor at Arizona State University. Prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table:. • Berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $3.88. • Broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $1.89. • Grapes by 64 cents a pound to $3.06. • Melons by 24 cents a pound to $1.23. • Packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $2.91. • Peppers by 26 cents a pound to $2.39. Though fruits and vegetable prices fell in February, overall prices are expected to rise this year, because of inflation, U.S. Department of Agriculture economist Annemarie Kuhns said. Fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, and vegetables between 2% and 3%, close to historical average increases, Kuhns said. Whether the California drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown, thanks to a strong dollar. The greenback's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of West Coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation, Kuhns said. Moreover, the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from California to the other 49 states, she said. What economists don't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought. Those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices, she said. \"The drought in California does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter,\" Kuhns said. \"We are not sure what the exact impact will be.\" The reality is there's a major drought throughout the West and Southwest. While not as bad as California, Texas and Oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states, the U.S. Drought Monitor said this week. Overall, the Western drought affects more than 52 million people, the monitor says. As a result, consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1% for beef and veal in 2014, the USDA reports. Straining under a drought that began in 2012, ranchers in Texas and Oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures, paid more for feed, and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle. So the cattlemen began culling their herds, Kuhns said. This year's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6% at most, still higher than the 4.1% historical average, the feds project. But beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought. \"There's other areas being affected,\" Kuhns said. It's called the Golden State for the gold rush of yore, but let's face it: the rest of the nation flocks to California for vacation because of another golden reason. Its year-round sunshine. So the next time you take a holiday in California, you'll find a few changes around here, thanks to the drought. Like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant. You won't find water waiting for you on the table. Eateries now \"can only serve water to customers on request,\" the State Water Resources Control Board declared in March under expanded emergency regulations. Tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily. These requests are mandatory under the new regulations. And they'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains. Because much of the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada has alarmingly disappeared, many ski resorts shut down early this year, including at Lake Tahoe, and some are now building zip lines, mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming, the Sacramento Bee reported. \"If the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more, the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are,\" State Water Board Chair Felicia Marcus said in March. But what about those yummy California wines, you ask? Guess what. They're only getting better -- because of the drought. Yes, you read that right. The 2014 wine grape harvest was \"third in a string of great vintages this decade,\" the Wine Institute says. \"California vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage, despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south Napa in late August just as crush was getting underway,\" the institute said in a statement last year. \"A mild winter and spring caused early bud break, although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years.\" Wine grapes use relatively low water, said institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi. \"Yes, drought years tend to produce terrific quality,\" she added. \"With the record high California wine grape harvests in 2012, 2013 and 2014, there is a good supply of California wine.\" That may be the only thing to toast about this drought.\n"], "model_retrieved_documents": ["SAN FRANCISCO – California and its plentiful farm fields are soaking wet. Asparagus farmers can't get into fields to harvest the tender green stalks. Tomato growers have greenhouses bursting with seedlings but it's too wet to transplant them. The planting timeline for lettuce keeps getting moved as fields stay drenched. \"It's just too damn messy and muddy to create a quality pack. You don't want a bunch of mud on the produce,\" said Christopher Valdez, president of the Grower-Shipper Association of Central California. This sodden state is a reversal of last year's drought, California has been hit by an absurd amount of water over the winter, with more than a dozen atmospheric rivers pouring more than 78 trillion gallons of water on the state. City dwellers can reach for umbrellas but for farmers, too much rain can mean unplanted or washed out fields and unharvestable crops. Tractors could either get stuck in the mud or create ruts or compressed soil in fields that might take years to recover. There's no choice but to simply wait until things dry out. AGRICULTURE AND CLIMATE:Ancient farming practice makes a comeback as climate change puts pressure on crops CLIMATE NEWS:Climate change washed away bald eagles' food, research says. Now these eagles are becoming farm birds. That means difficulty for many of the state's 69,000 farms and the communities that depend on them. The state is an agricultural powerhouse, producing over a third of the country’s vegetables and three-quarters of its fruits and nuts. How have the drenching rains affected California's bounty? Although California is a major source of U.S.-grown fruits and vegetables in the spring and summer, the crisp greens, ripe fruit and luscious berries we eat come from across the United States and as far away as south and central America. Because of this, even though 60% of California's farmland had \"surplus\" water according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Crop Progress report for the week ending March 26, produce shelves won't be empty and prices won't be significantly higher in the coming weeks and months, said Gary Keough, director of USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service Pacific regional office in Sacramento. \"The majority of crops are continuing to mature and will be available for harvest, so there will be a plentiful supply of fresh vegetables coming from 'the salad bowl,' as California's Salinas valley is sometimes called, said Valdez. While the majority of acres are still able to produce, there are areas and crops that are being especially impacted. In the central part of the state and in the cool-weather farms around the Salinas area, head and leaf lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and strawberries have had a rough time.

Now they're in this period waiting until they can get crops in the ground,\" said Valadez. \"I don't expect there will be shortages, but there will be some gaps,\" he said. While consumers aren't likely to see big price jumps at the checkout stand, the economic pain is very real for farmers and farm workers. Many of the crops grown in California are labor intensive and if workers can't get into the fields, they can't work. \"We're talking about workers who aren't getting jobs, and their homes may also have been flooded,\" said Daniel Sumner, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of California, Davis Growers, too are hurting. Some are potentially looking at major losses, sometimes in the millions. As has long been the case in agriculture, those who succeed in the business are the ones who \"have a diversified portfolio of crops, sophisticated algorithms, a lot of experience and really cast iron nerves,\" Sumner said. California produces 90% of the nation's processed tomatoes and more than a quarter of the world's total. From late summer to fall the roads of the state's growing regions are packed with trucks filled with 50,000 pounds of tomatoes and the air is redolent of tomatoes being canned at local processing plants.

Why it likely will get worse. \"The transplants are in the greenhouses but they can only get so big before you start to worry about what you're going to do with them,\" he said. \"The greenhouses only have so much room and they need to free up space for the new incoming seeds.\" Not being able to plant now will cause problems when harvest begins. \"They like us to stagger our plantings so they can stagger the fruit coming into the canneries,\" said Yerxa. With the state's tomato growers producing two million pounds of tomatoes a week at the height of harvest, this year that's likely to get backed up. California leads the nation in the production of figs, table grapes, kiwis, nectarines, peaches, persimmons, plums and pluots. The cold, wet weather has slowed things down. \"The bees did not work as hard as we would have liked them to this year,\" said Ian LeMay, president of the California Fresh Fruit Association. \"We're seeing a later harvest period this year, probably by 7 to 10 days.\" That doesn't mean the nation's fruit bowls will be empty, he said. \"For consumers throughout the United States, grocery shelves will still be full and they'll be able to access most of the fruits and vegetables they're used to.\" But as with tomatoes, the meticulous planning of different varieties will be off. Fruit growers plant a careful selection of varieties so they're harvesting a given varietal for a week or two at a time. \"The beginning and early fruit might be late and then if the spring warms up you could have varieties catching up on each other,\" LeMay said. \"It creates some harvesting challenges,\" he said. \"But we can't control how Mother Nature influences when a piece of fruit is ready.\"", "Snow, torrential rains, massive floods. Extreme weather has battered the U.S. this year, and shoppers likely will feel the lingering effects at the grocery store heading into summer. Good weather, especially in the spring when planting season starts, is vital to growing a bountiful crop of fruits, nuts and vegetables. But the extreme swings this year have left many growers behind schedule, especially in California, which produces nearly half of U.S. fruits, nuts and \"salad bowl\" vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes, spinach and kale, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Although farmers are optimistic they can recover from delayed planting timelines, it may take a few months. In the meantime, consumers may see smaller selections, lower supplies and higher prices, experts say. “This year is extreme,” said Brad Rubin, sector manager for specialty crops within Wells Fargo’s Agri-Food Institute. “The amount of wet weather and a cold spring delayed plantings in major areas of California.” Flooded with problems:California's vast farms are soaked.

Try baking this chicken pot pie recipe. Berries, lettuce and other green leafy vegetables and tomatoes are among the major crops that will suffer from the flooding in California. Intense rainfall breached a levee and flooded the central California communities of Watsonville and Salinas, which produce about one-third of the state’s strawberries. The overflow left about one-fifth of the fields underwater. Floods in the Salinas Valley, the nation's “salad bowl” that grows more than 60% of its lettuce, also hampered planting. Not only did farmers have to wait for the water to subside, but they also had to make sure the soil wasn’t contaminated with bacteria that could cause foodborne illness. In late February, the Monterey County agricultural commissioner’s office in California estimated the value of crops lost and projected future losses at $324.1 million. Salinas and Salinas Valley are part of Monterey County, and Watsonville is part of Santa Cruz County. Crops hit the hardest included romaine lettuce, strawberries, wine grapes, celery, carrots, broccoli and garlic, it said. “What we have seen at local farmers markets is an increase in price,” Wells Fargo’s Rubin said. “At retail stores, some supply imported from Mexico has helped keep prices down, but the organic and locally grown has been more expensive.” Climate hits our food:Weird weather hit cattle ranchers and citrus growers in 2022. Why it likely will get worse. Lost grains:Global rice shortage possible in 2023, prices are expected to remain high, analysts say The extreme cold, windy and wet weather across the country has prevented bees from pollinating as usual. “Bees do not fly in hard rain or high winds,” said Charlotte Anderson, South Carolina’s first female master beekeeper, in her blog. “Hard rain could break their wings, and in windy weather, the effort often outweighs the rewards.” As a result, crops that depend on pollination could feel the effects of bee disruption. “No one will know until May or June, but everyone is speculating almonds will be light this year based on the lack of bee flight during pollinations,” Rubin said. Bees are moved around the country to help pollinate crops, especially California almonds between February and March each year. “Without bees, there would be no almonds,” the Almond Board of California says. Almonds are the seventh-most valuable crop in the United States, and are all grown in California, which also supplies 80% of the world’s production. It also represents the largest pollination service market for honeybees. After almonds service, beekeepers bring their honeybees to different locations across the United States, pollinating more than 90 other crops and making honey. Almond prices are already reflecting expectations of a smaller crop. In March, prices soared 33% from February, marking the largest monthly increase since November 2014, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. On an annual basis, almond prices jumped nearly 58% in March to post the biggest increase since 1995, it said.

After several years of drought in California, reservoirs are full, helping eliminate water restrictions from the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, Rubin said. The act was passed in 2014 to help protect groundwater resources over the long term. With reservoirs full, farmers didn’t have to irrigate and won’t have to pay additional fees for water to the Sustainable Groundwater Management board, he said. The biggest winners? Wineries. Everyone’s predicting a good wine crop, Rubin said. Because the rain came early while the vines were dormant, or not yet primed for growth, vines weren’t damaged, and the soil got refreshed. The water also washed away any toxic salt deposits from previous years. Weather effects:Climate change is coming for your wine.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said last month that an El Niño event was 62% likely from May through July and more than 80% probable by fall. An El Niño is a warming of sea surface temperature in the eastern Pacific Ocean that can affect global weather and increase the risk of natural disasters, such as floods in some areas and droughts in others. How strong a possible El Niño could be remains unclear, NOAA said. “The main implication could be higher food prices and stresses in emerging market countries vulnerable to such a shock,” said Deutsche Bank economist Jim Reid.

The landmark rules are required by two laws that former Gov. Jerry Brown signed in 2018 after a severe five-year drought. Environmentalists and some water districts support them, saying they are critical as the state grapples with climate change and more severe droughts. But some water agencies have been strongly opposed, saying Sacramento is beginning a new era of micro-managing how local communities use water. Under the new rules, roughly 400 of the California’s largest cities and water districts are required to come up with a water-use budget every year beginning Jan. 1, 2025. They could eventually face fines of up to $1,000 a day — and $10,000 a day during drought emergencies — for failing to set and meet appropriate targets. In general, the Central Valley and Southern California’s inland communities could face the biggest cuts, while places where water conservation levels already are higher, including the Bay Area and much of coastal Southern California, would have far fewer or no required reductions in the first few years. “We see conservation as one tool in the toolbox to address the water supply challenges that are going to result from climate change and a hotter, drier future,” said Eric Oppenheimer, chief deputy director of the State Water Resources Control Board. The new laws make it likely that water agencies will need to take such actions as offering more rebates for home owners and business owners who replace lawns with drought-tolerant plants and who purchase water-efficient appliances. The agencies could also limit the hours and days of lawn watering to meet their targets, even when droughts are not occurring. The targets will vary by community. They are based on a formula made up of three main factors: a standard of 47 gallons per person per day for indoor water use — dropping to 42 gallons by 2030; an amount for outdoor residential use that varies by community depending on regional climates; and a standard for water loss due to rates of leaks in water system pipes. This week, state water officials made public the first detailed look of how the new rules could affect each city. The first threshold, in 2025, would spare a total of 228 cities and water agencies that serve 73% of California’s urban population, including nearly all of the Bay Area. They already use water efficiently enough to meet the new state standards, the State Water Resources Control Board estimated. Those include most of the state’s major water providers, among them the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, the East Bay Municipal Utility District, San Jose Water Company, city of San Diego and others. But 80 water agencies representing 15% of the population would need to reduce use by up to 10% starting in 2025, the board estimated. Those include Livermore, Hollister, Newport Beach and Ukiah. Another 51 water agencies representing 8% of California’s urban population would need to reduce their water use by 10% to 20% starting in 2025, the state board estimated. Those include Tracy, Martinez, Fresno, Modesto and Beverly Hills. Finally, another 37 water agencies representing 4% of the state’s urban population would have to cut water use by 20% or more starting in 2025, the state board estimated. Those include Los Banos, Bakersfield, Merced and the Desert Water Agency in Palm Springs. State water board officials say that the initial targets are their best estimate. The targets could still change because cities and water agencies will be allowed to get credit under the law if they use recycled water or have significant population changes, among other factors. But the new state estimates clearly show that by the end of this decade, most major water providers could have to reduce their use. By 2030, the state water board estimated, only 97 agencies representing 28% of the state’s urban population would escape additional conservation requirements. Another 88 with 18% of the state’s urban population would see cutbacks of 10% to 20%, and 134 representing 19% of the state’s urban population would see required cutbacks of 20% or more. Environmental groups say the rules are common sense. Water that cities save can be used to reduce the severity of mandatory rationing during droughts, said Tracy Quinn, CEO of Heal the Bay, a Los Angeles environmental group.

We want to set California up for a successful water-efficiency future.” Some independent analysts say the rules could spark a major controversy as the state water board imposes them over the next year. “Why would the state want to get into this business?” said Jay Lund, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at UC Davis. “Most of the urban water agencies are doing a pretty good job. They understand that droughts are getting worse, and seem to be preparing for that in their own ways.” Public hearings on the draft rules begin in October. A final vote by the state water board is expected next summer.

In Napa, Stu Smith, founder at Smith-Madrone, credited a cold and wet winter, followed by a persistent ‘June gloom’ to this year’s harvest delay, which he predicts to be around three weeks behind average. Winemaker Paul Hobbs added: ‘Heat units expressed in growing degree days (GDD) year-to-date were down 200-300 degrees by late June, making this one of the coolest growing seasons since Paul Hobbs Winery began keeping records.’ Paul Hobbs among the vines at the Katherine Lindsay Estate. Credit: Paul Hobbs Winery Napa’s Maya Dalla Valle of Dalla Valle Vineyards agrees. ‘We are about three weeks behind compared to last year, and growing degree day wise, we are sitting at 1977 compared to 2294 at this time in 2021, and 2204 in 2018. So this is the coolest year we have seen in quite a few vintages,’ she said. She noted that by this time in 2022, veraison had already finished, whereas today, it hasn’t even begun for her Cabernet Franc. Elsewhere in Napa, Ehlers Estate winemaker Laura Díaz Muñoz also cited a potential three-week harvest delay. At Massican, winemaker Dan Petroski described this year’s conditions as similar to pre-2013 days, ‘when we still considered August summer vacation’. Drought and warm conditions of the past 10 years have continued to push harvest earlier and earlier. This year reminds Petroski of what harvest was like seven to 10 years ago. ‘No one can say the last few years were normal. It might be the “new normal”, but this year is feeling like the good old days,’ he said. Petroski added that he is about two weeks behind last year in most instances. Over in Sonoma, Aperture Cellars’ winemaker Jesse Katz has seen similar conditions. ‘The rain and cold weather pushed back our bud break by about three weeks, and the vines woke up to cool, wet soils and very cool temperatures,’ he said. Katz described this past spring as one of the coolest on record. ‘The vines were slow to start, but as they developed, our canopies looked very happy, and cluster count looked good,’ he affirmed. Most northern California winemakers agree that the excessive rains of 2023 have provided much-needed relief to the vines. ‘After several years of severe drought, this winter’s 70 inches of rain was a gift from heaven,’ said Smith, describing a complete groundwater replenishment and the vigorous response to the water. Hobbs added: ‘The rain refilled most reservoirs and lakes to full capacity and also helped resupply aquifers.’ Dalla Valle shared that due to the replenishing effects of rain, her team had to do very little to no irrigation this year. ‘This, combined with cool weather, has slowed growth and increased canopy vigour,’ she said. Winemaker Maya Dalla Valle. Credit: Jimmy Hayes Although most effects of the excessive rain have been positive in northern California, a few small concerns remain. Katz cited having to do a bit more canopy work than in previous years due to the vigour. He also noted a bit of ‘shatter’ due to cool weather during flowering, though he still described the crop load as ‘above average’. In addition to canopy management, Díaz Muñoz shared that larger canopies and rapid growth have caused some nutrition deficiency in certain vines. However, it’s nothing to be too worried about. ‘This is not exactly a big concern, but it adds an extra layer of vineyard management and yield adjustments this year,’ she said. Díaz Muñoz highlighted that delayed harvest increases the risk of fires, as producers must wait for the right time to pick. According to all winemakers interviewed, things are looking good across the board. Hobbs noted that temperatures rebounded in July, and canopies look healthy despite overcast conditions during bloom. ‘Nevertheless, veraison is still weeks away as the fruit is still sizing,’ he said. ‘We are now finally seeing some heat, and the vines look incredible,’ said Katz, stating that even with the heat and favourable weather, he still predicts that harvest will begin three weeks later than last year – and go well into October, or even potentially November, should Mother Nature allow it. Aperture is just starting to see veraison in some of its earlier-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon sites, three weeks behind last year. Sonoma’s Stonestreet Estate Vineyards. Credit: Clive Pursehouse Petroski predicts that his picking will begin at the end of August and finish during the first week of October (Massican works with 15 different vineyard sites planted to 12 varieties across Napa, Sonoma and Lodi, hence the varied maturity times). Although Dalla Valle typically begins during the first two weeks of September, she foresees beginning around 25 September this year (similar to 2018 and 2019). With regards to quality, the vintage looks bright. ‘I think we are set for a brilliant harvest with a vintage that has more overall acidity and lower sugars than normal,’ said Katz, noting that there is still much more of the season to unfold. Smith said that despite the set not being uniform, the overall crop load looks good, although potentially lower in some sites due to years of severe drought. Dalla Valle added that although a lot can happen between now and harvest, this year’s conditions thus far remind her most of 2010, a great vintage marked by concentration and balanced acidity. Hobbs forecasts a fine harvest of typical yields, though seeing as vintage will go well into October, there’s much unpredictability between now and then. ‘Still, as we have seen in other late years, the added hang time and protracted late season ripening often plays to our favour, provided mother nature doesn’t strike with a nasty curveball,’ he said. Díaz Muñoz concluded, ‘I feel positive about both quantity and quality of the fruit. I can only pray for minimum and short heat events now.’", "Logging you in. Logging you out. Updating your account.

Due to cooler temperatures this spring and summer, which have allowed grapes to mature slowly and gradually, timing is anywhere from a week or two behind normal to nearly a month late. While it is still early in the harvest, California vintners are looking forward to a high-quality 2023 vintage. Twomey Cellars in Napa Valley for example began picking Sauvignon Blanc grapes on Aug. 28, a week to 10 days later than normal. “It was just a drop in the bucket as far as volume, but it's a start nonetheless,” noted Silver Oak Managing Director Nate Weis, who manages winemaking teams at Silver Oak, Twomey, OVID Napa Valley and Timeless Napa Valley. “This reminds me of when I started in this business — a more typical schedule.” Winter brought an unusual amount of rain in the Napa and Sonoma regions, he said, along with cool weather and wet soils that delayed and then extended the bloom period. Veraison began around late July and has proceeded slowly. Weis said the winery will likely start harvesting red varieties in approximately three weeks. “Phenology is kind of all over the place,” he said. “Pinot Noir seems to be very slow to finish veraison, so I think Bordeaux reds may start before Pinot in a lot of cases.” Although rain is always a concern with later-starting harvests, Weis noted that the slower development for Pinot Noir may be beneficial. “That could be a really good thing for quality as long as the weather holds.” Though the season’s humidity increased disease pressure, Weis hasn’t seen much mildew in the vineyards. “Because of the cool summer, everything’s looking pretty darn good,” he said. “I’m optimistic about that for sure.” At LangeTwins Family Winery and Vineyards in Lodi, harvest kicked off on Aug. 11 with grapes for sparkling wine. Co-founder Randy Lange estimated that vineyards are running two to three weeks behind the normal start of harvest, which typically begins in late July. “We had very cool weather all the way through spring,” Lange said. In response to the later start, he noted that LangeTwins’ vineyard crews dropped fruit for some late-ripening varieties that are unlikely to finish maturing before the season ends. Aaron Lange, vice president of vineyard operations, said heavy winter rains brought much-needed moisture to the vines after years of drought, yet the precipitation also increased the potential for mildew. “We’ve been working hard to mitigate those challenges and create the ideal ripening environment through shoot thinning, leaf removal and careful crop thinning,” he said. Aaron Lange estimated that Cabernet Sauvignon will be ready for picking around the first or second week of October rather than the typical timing of late September. “Overall, 2023 is shaping up to be a superior vintage,” he said. “We’re in a position to create one of the best crops ever in Lodi.” The situation appears similar in Paso Robles. As of late August, vintners in the region had not yet begun harvesting. “It’s been a slow-development year, despite some end of July and August heat. We are behind in our growing degree-day accumulation by two to three weeks,” said Stasi Seay, director of vineyards at Hope Family Wines. “What is clear is that harvest will be delayed as we move into a late veraison period.” Winter storms brought both benefits and challenges to the region, she added, from pushing down salts that had built up in the soils after years of drought to flooding in vineyards located near creeks and riverbeds. While wet and windy conditions during the spring bloom period caused some shatter and increased mildew pressure, berry growth has been good. “Overall, the increase in vine health from a wet winter is yielding more typically sized clusters in many varietals, which is great,” said Seay. “Late harvests can be tricky and nerve-wracking, but that said, they can also provide the much-needed hang time for natural maturation of berries, provided the fall weather is warm and steady. This will absolutely increase quality in red varietals.” For end-of-season details about the 2023 California winegrape harvest across the state, look for Wine Institute’s comprehensive annual report this fall.

For the full press release, visit NOAA.gov. Significant flooding is ongoing in the western U.S., especially in California, following another series of strong Pacific storms that battered the region and piled on to an already historic snowpack. According to NOAA’s U.S. Spring Outlook, the abnormally wet winter will further improve drought across much of the western U.S. as the snowpack melts in the coming months. Conditions across most of the western United States were either abnormally dry (yellow) or in some level of drought (peach=moderate, orange=severe, red=extreme, dark red=exceptional) as of March 14, 2023. Explore past conditions at Drought.gov. Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from the U.S. Drought Monitor project. Moderate to exceptional drought coverage across the U.S. is at its lowest since August 2020 and is likely to continue improving, or end entirely, across much of California and the Great Basin. The spring wet season is expected to improve drought conditions across parts of the northern and central Plains. Current drought conditions in Florida are expected to improve or go away during the next three months. Projected changes in drought through spring 2023 across the United States. After more than a year of drought, significant parts of the West are expected to see drought conditions improve (light brown) or end (green). Parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Southern Plains are likely to see drought develop (yellow), continue, or worsen (dark brown). Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center. Areas of extreme to exceptional drought across parts of the southern High Plains are likely to persist through the spring season, with drought also expected to develop into parts of New Mexico. Across parts of the Northwest U.S. and northern Rockies, drought conditions are also expected to continue. Drought may develop into parts of Washington state. There is a risk for flooding in most of the eastern half of the continental United States, including most of the Mississippi River Basin. Forecasters with the National Water Center, in concert with NWS River Forecast Centers, predict moderate to major flooding along the Mississippi River from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to St. Louis, Missouri. A large portion of the eastern United States is at risk of minor flooding (yellow) in spring 2023. Moderate flooding (light red) is likely in several Upper Mississippi watersheds as well as in central California. The risk of major flooding (purple) is confined to portions of the Upper Mississippi. Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from the National Water Center. An above normal to record snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains, combined with elevated soil moisture, increases the threat of spring flooding due to snowmelt, especially at high elevations. Spring snowmelt will bring welcomed water supply benefits to much of California and the Great Basin. Reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin, such as Lake Powell and Lake Mead, are currently at record low water levels following years of drought. Above-average temperatures are favored for much of the southern and eastern half of the U.S. For April through June, the greatest chance for above-average temperatures exists from the southern High Plains eastward to Florida, and northward along the East Coast. Above-average temperatures are also likely for Hawaii and northern parts of Alaska. Below-average temperatures are predicted for the central Great Basin and the northern Plains. A much warmer than average spring is slightly favored (light orange) for much of the East in spring 2023. The odds are even higher (red) along the Gulf Coast, the Eastern Seaboard, and northwest Hawaii. A much cooler than average spring is slightly favored (light blue) in the northernmost Great Plains and a small pocket of the Intermountain West. White areas show where forecasters have concluded that the chances of a warm spring, a cool spring, or an average spring are all equal. Map by NOAA Climate.gov, based on data from the Climate Prediction Center. NOAA forecasters predict above-average precipitation this spring across the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and into parts of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Below-average precipitation is most likely for the Southwest and parts of the Pacific Northwest. A much wetter than average spring is slightly favored (light green) for the Great Lakes region in spring 2023. A much drier than average spring is slightly favored (light brown) in the Southwest and a corner of the Pacific Northwest. For most of the country, forecasters have concluded that the chances of a wet spring, a dry spring, or an average spring are all equal (white).

Drought in California and Nevada is a common occurrence that can last for multiple years. The regional climate is characterized by a distinct dry season (approximately May to September) and wet season (approximately October to April) defined by a few large precipitation events, though additional peaks in precipitation can occur. Topography within the region creates a diverse set of climate conditions, from the snowy peaks of the Sierra Nevada Range to the Mojave Desert, to the mountains and valleys of the Basin and Range. Given the extreme variability, both spatially and temporally, efficiently using and effectively managing finite water resources is a high priority.To support drought early warning capacity and resilience to drought events in both California and Nevada, NOAA’s National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) launched the California-Nevada Drought Early Warning System (DEWS). The California-Nevada DEWS is a network of regional and national partners that share information and coordinate actions to help communities in the region prepare for and cope with droughtReach out to Amanda Sheffield, the Regional Drought Coordinator for this region, for more information, or sign up for the California-Nevada DEWS newsletter.

Drought is a normal climate pattern that has occurred in varying degrees of length, severity, and size throughout history. Below, you can look back at past drought conditions for California according to 3 historical drought indices. The U.S. Drought Monitor is a weekly map that shows the location and intensity of drought across the country since 2000. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a monthly depiction of drought based on precipitation (with data going back to 1895). And the paleoclimate data uses tree-ring reconstructions to estimate drought conditions before we had widespread instrumental records, going back to the year 0 for some parts of the U.S. View more historical conditions. Abnormally Dry (D0) indicates a region that is going into or coming out of drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. View typical impacts by state. Moderate Drought (D1) is the first of four drought categories (D1–D4), according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. View typical impacts by state. Severe Drought (D2) is the second of four drought categories (D1–D4), according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. View typical impacts by state. Extreme Drought (D3) is the third of four drought categories (D1–D4), according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. View typical impacts by state. Exceptional Drought (D4) is the most intense drought category, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. View typical impacts by state. The U.S. Drought Monitor (2000–present) depicts the location and intensity of drought across the country. Every Thursday, authors from NOAA, USDA, and the National Drought Mitigation Center produce a new map based on their assessments of the best available data and input from local observers. The map uses five categories: Abnormally Dry (D0), showing areas that may be going into or are coming out of drought, and four levels of drought (D1–D4). Learn more.

Drought results from an imbalance between water supply and water demand. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) measures water supply, specifically precipitation. SPI captures how observed precipitation (rain, hail, snow) deviates from the climatological average over a given time period—in this case, over the 9 months leading up to the selected date. Red hues indicate drier conditions, while blue hues indicate wetter conditions. Data are available monthly from 1895–present.

We'd love to hear about your experience using Drought.gov!", "", "More than half of California is drought-free after what was anything but a dry February. After unrelenting storms brought rain and snow last month, only 49 percent of the state remains in the moderate drought category, according to this week's U.S. Drought Monitor report. That figure stood at 99 percent in October at the start of California's water year. \"January was a very wet month for us, and February is going down in the record books,\" said NBC4 forecaster Belen De Leon. \"When we started the water year, we had exceptional, extreme drought conditions all across the state. \"Today, things are looking much better. This is a result of all the rain, all the snow.\" Moderate drought is the least severe of four categories in the weekly report. The most severe drought categories were wiped off the map earlier this winter. DROUGHT UPDATE: It's been a stormy start to the year and the recent rain and snow has really helped our drought. Look at where we are today vs. start of the water year. Ventura County is drought free with the rest of SoCal under abnormal drought conditions. @NBCLA pic.twitter.com/AXf3JWXfI0 About 25 percent of the state remains in severe drought, a significant improvement from the start of the water year when 94 percent of California was in that category. Drought conditions were eliminated this week along portions of the California coast, including Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, and part of Los Angeles County. \"When we look at the rain surplus, not only are we on pace, we're ahead of pace when it comes to our seasonal average,\" said De Leon. The central Sierra Nevada Mountains and foothills also are out of the drought categories for the first time since January 2020. “The rain has improved California soil moisture and streamflow levels, while the snow has increased mountain snowpack to much above-normal levels,” according to the Monitor. “Most California reservoirs have refilled with water levels near or above average, but groundwater levels remain low and may take months to recover.” The U.S. Drought Monitor is a joint project of the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Drought Monitor report released Thursday includes information available up to Feb. 28. California has spent most of the last 15 years in drought. The current dry spell included one of the driest late winters on record. The state's normal wet season runs from late fall to the end of winter, but dismal precipitation left about 95 percent of California in severe drought at the start of spring. By September, nearly all of California was in drought. Much of California’s water comes from melting snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. In an ideal scenario, storms blanket the mountains with snow during winter, building up the natural reservoir. That snow then melts in late spring and early summer, replenishing the state's water system. Snowpack was far below normal in Spring 2022. California's statewide snowpack level was more than 200 percent above normal in mid-December after powerful December storms blanketed the Sierra Nevada Mountains with snow. That total has improved after February storms brought several more feet of snow. The water content of the Sierra snowpack, which provides about a third of California's water, is more than 160% of the historical average on April 1, when it is normally at its peak, according to the state Department of Water Resources.", "", "Times of San Diego Local News and Opinion for San Diego A lack of rain and snow in central California and restricted water supplies from the Colorado River in the southernmost part of the state have withered summer crops like tomatoes and onions and threatened leafy greens grown in the winter. That has added pressure to grocery prices, putting a squeeze on wallets with no end in sight. The rise in food prices this year has helped drive U.S. inflation to its highest levels in 40 years. California’s drought conditions, on top of Hurricane Ian ravaging citrus and tomato crops in Florida, are likely to push food costs even higher. Drought in an area known as the U.S. salad bowl has not only impacted fresh produce, but also pantry staples like pasta sauce and premade dinners. “There’s just not enough water to grow everything that we normally grow,” said Don Cameron, president of the State Board of Food and Agriculture. Cameron also grows processing tomatoes, onions, garlic and more than a dozen other crops near Fresno, California. The most recent drought in California began in 2020, worsening when California’s Central Valley faced its driest January and February in recorded history. Snowpack, supplying surface water for much of the Central Valley, reached just 38% of its historic average by April, according to the Sierra Nevada Conservancy, a state agency focused on conservation efforts. Near Firebaugh, Aaron Barcellos planted just a quarter of the 2,000 acres of his family’s fourth generation farm. This summer, he harvested tomatoes two weeks early to prevent further drought damage. “I don’t think farming in California has ever been more complex and more challenging, and the drought is a large part of that,” said Barcellos.

California produces about 30% of the world’s processing tomatoes, but in August the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its 2022 forecast to 10.5 million tonnes, down 10% from its 12.2 million tonne estimate earlier in the year. Because of the shortfall, farmers this year negotiated higher prices for tomatoes, as well as onions and garlic used for spices in countless boxed meals and other grocery store staples, Cameron said. “What you’re seeing harvested this summer, that really hasn’t even hit the grocery shelf, is a 25% increase in the cost of the product to the processors – the canners, the buyers downstream,” he said. “The onions and garlic have already been negotiated for 2023, with another 25% increase in price.” Cameron said tomato prices face a similar hike, resulting in a 50% increase in cost to canners and processors from 2021 to 2023. Ketchup and other tomato-based pasta sauce maker Kraft Heinz Co said it’s sourcing tomatoes from other regions to make up for California’s shortfall. A company spokesperson said Kraft could guarantee tomato supplies in grocery stores, but did not rule out price increases. In southern California, Imperial Valley farmers are planting hundreds of acres of leafy greens to harvest this winter. The region faces water restrictions due to record low levels on the Colorado River, the source of water for both Imperial and Coachella Valley, the largest producer of dates in the U.S. Jack Vessey grows lettuce, cabbage and leafy greens on more than 500 acres near Holtville, California, along the Mexico and Arizona borders. He currently has enough water for his crops, but worries that further cuts could leave his crops withering in the field. Vessey normally plants alfalfa for livestock feed or durum wheat for pasta in January, but said he may fallow the land to save his Colorado River water allotment for higher value crops. “That’s our only water source. It’s not just about agriculture,” said Vessey. “You’d be killing a community.” With the generous support of readers like you, Times of San Diego publishes timely and accurate news coverage for a better-informed community.

In a phone call with CNBC.com, Richards added that the price increases would also include foods including berries, broccoli, grapes, melons, tomatoes, peppers and packaged salads. The higher rises should be felt in the next two to three months, he said. Read MoreRising food prices pinching consumers To come up with his figures, Richards used retail-sales data from the Nielsen Perishables Group, an industry analytics and consulting firm, to estimate how much the prices might vary for the fruit and vegetable crops most likely to be affected by the drought. Those most vulnerable are crops that use the most water or those sensitive to reductions in irrigation, according to Richards. Industry estimates range from a half-million to 1 million acres of agricultural land in California likely to be affected by the current drought, said Richards. The state's governor, Jerry Brown, declared a state of emergency in January due to the lack of water. The Golden State grows more than 200 different crops, some grown nowhere else in the U.S. California produces almost all of the country's almonds, apricots, dates, figs, kiwi fruit, nectarines, olives, pistachios, prunes, and walnuts. It leads in the production of avocados, grapes, lemons, melons, peaches, plums, and strawberries. Only Florida produces more oranges. Richards said he believes between 10 and 20 percent of the supply of certain crops from the state could be lost. Richards estimates the following price increases: Avocados likely to go up by 17 to 35 cents to as much as $1.60 each. Berries likely to rise by 21 to 43 cents to as much as $3.46 per clamshell container.Broccoli likely to go up by 20 to 40 cents to a possible $2.18 per pound.Grapes likely to rise by 26 to 50 cents to a possible $2.93 per pound.Lettuce likely to rise by 31 to 62 cents to as much as $2.44 per head.Packaged salad likely to go up by 17 to 34 cents to a possible $3.03 per bag.Peppers likely to go up by 18 to 35 cents to a possible $2.48 per pound.Tomatoes likely to rise by 22 to 45 cents to a possible $2.84 per pound. Richards said that even if the drought ended today, it would take months for his projected price increases to reverse, due to severely low snow pack in the California mountains. When it melts, that runoff helps feed the state's water supply. He explained that even with the rising prices, consumers will likely be more wiling to pay them for the items he's researched. But Sherry Fey, vice president of Nielsen Perishables Group, is not so sure. Read MoreInsurers offer new incentives to eat healthy \"We've identified certain consumers who will be more heavily affected by the price increases,\" she said in an email. \"For example, younger consumers of avocados would be affected and likely not buy them.\" Fey also said that non-produce snacking categories, such as chips and crackers that are often consumed with foods like avocados, could be negatively affected with lower sales. Richards also said that retailers will start looking elsewhere for produce, and that includes importing more items from countries like Chile and Mexico. That could be an issue for some consumers who want only domestic fruits and vegetables. Imports could help contain price increases but may create possible health concerns, according to Richards. Read More \"We have border inspections of course but things that go wrong with crops usually happen at the growing source, \" Richards explained. \"So there could be some added risk.\" Besides the California drought, Richards said a shortage of labor in agriculture is aggravating price increases. \"It's like a perfect storm,\" he said. \"We don't have enough water or enough workers to pick crops. So much food is left in the fields. It's just adding to the woes.\" Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Data also provided by", "Jump to A megadrought in California is threatening to push food prices even higher. The state is already facing its worst water shortage in four years and the its driest season has only just begun, according to data from the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS). As water levels continue to fall, farmers and ranchers will be unable to maintain key crops and feed livestock. As of Tuesday, nearly 75% of California was classified as in \"extreme drought,\" meaning the land does not have adequate water supplies to sustain agriculture and wildlife, according to the NIDIS. While farmers have come to expect and prepare for droughts, this year has already been much hotter and drier than previous ones. Scorching California weather is drying up reservoirs, as well as the Sierra Nevada snowpack that helps supply them. The reservoirs are 50% lower than they should be in June, Jay Lund, co-director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California-Davis, told Associated Press. The farmer's plight could make products like almonds, avocados, and milk more expensive for shoppers as farmers struggle to produce crops of the state's top exports. California produces over 25% of the nation's food supply. California agriculture is a nearly $50 billion industry and is known for producing over 400 key commodities, according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Dave Kranz, a California Farm Bureau spokesperson, told Insider it's too soon to tell whether the drought will have a significant impact on grocery prices, but it is sure to be a \"catastrophic\" year for farmers. He said he's already seen several farmers scaling back their crops and prioritizing ones that rely less on water supplies. \"A lot of factors play into the prices people see at stores,\" Kranz said. \"The payment that farmers receive for their crops is a very small portion of the price shoppers pay. Most of it comes from transportation, packaging, and marketing.\" The last time the state faced a drought of this magnitude, experts said shoppers could expect prices to rise about 3% and predicted the Californian agriculture industry could be handicapped for years, Gannett reported. During the 2014 drought, experts told CNBC prices for top California exports like avocados, berries, broccoli, grapes, and lettuce could rise anywhere from 17 to 62 cents, depending on the product. Any potential price increases do not occur immediately or all at once. They are often felt long after the drought has already wreaked havoc on local farm crops, Annemarie Kuhns, a member of the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service, told the Des Moines Register in 2015. \"It takes time before the effects are seen at the retail level,\" Kuhns said. \"Once you see drought conditions start to improve you'll see these effects further down the road.\" Droughts are nothing new for California farmers, who use conservation practices that reduce water runoff and allow moisture to enter the soil. Farmers also focus on crops that require less water, though about 40% of the 24.6 million acres of farmland in California require irrigation, Reuters reported. Many farmers told the publication that they are planning to leave large portions of their land unseeded due to this year's drought. The farms are allocated some water from the state, but this year the California Department of Water Resources reduced farmers and growers to 5% of their expected water allocation in March. Last month, Chris Scheuring, California Farm Bureau senior counsel, said it appears the state will soon not be able to deliver even at the 5% level. \"It's one of those existential years in California, when we've got an extreme drought and farmers are going to be hurting all over the place,\" Scheuring said. \"Some folks may be able to default to groundwater, but it's going to be a very, very tough year for farmers.\" Farmers can purchase supplemental water if they can find it, but it comes at a hefty price. Supplemental water was priced at $1,500 to $2,000 per acre-foot in mid-May, according to a report from California Farm Bureau. During the state's last drought, which ended in 2016, the agriculture industry lost roughly $3.8 billion, according to National Geographic. NIDIS analysts said in their last report that the outlook for this year is \"grim.\" The California water shortage and potential for a dip in food exports from the state pile onto a growing supply chain crisis precipitated by COVID-19 shutdowns. California dairy products, almonds, grapes, lettuce, and avocados won't be the only products in short supply in the coming months. Imported goods like olive oil and cheese are also facing shortages, while meats, including hot dogs, bacon, and chicken have become increasingly valuable. Read next", "Because of dwindling supplies, California Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened to impose mandatory water restrictions in Southern California with heavy fines if residents don’t use less on their own as the drought drags on and the hotter summer months approach. New water restrictions posted in May/2023 for businesses and residents are nearly identical to the ones put in place on June 1st, 2022. What are the new California lawn watering restrictions for 2023? Over the past few years, California has experienced the worst drought in recorded history. People here in this region know firsthand the challenges families and farmers face when water becomes scarce. Access to safe, clean, and reliable water is the lifeblood of the Central Valley’s booming agricultural economy, and ensuring access to water is imperative to everyday life. Table of Contents More than 6 million California residents in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Ventura counties are limited to watering outdoor plants once a week and are under new water restrictions as of today the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California made an urgent demand for a 35% reduction in the use of water throughout the state. The entire state of California is suffering from a severe drought. Water Reservoirs are currently at half of their historical averages and the normal precipitation that happens at the beginning of the year was less than predicted. Officials of the Water District say that because of Climate Change in the last decade across the region water supplies have dwindled. The snowpack from the Sierra Mountains that the region has relied on for years is gone. This, along with an existing drought for the last 3 years that they say is the worst ever on record contributes to this critical situation. Up to 80% of the population depends on groundwater for their water needs. In some communities in Southern California, people depend on 100% for groundwater. Officials are asking everyone to limit the amount of use to help get them through this summer. Reducing irrigations of lawns and accounting for every drop will be needed in not just the coming months but to the end of the year to get through what they call a dire situation. The Southern California Water District declared a water shortage last month in April and said that the Drought is the worst in 1200 years. Water agencies could be fined up to $10,000 per day if they didn’t comply. The State Water Board has imposed some statewide restrictions such as banning people from watering their lawns for 48 hours after rainstorms and sprinklers from running onto sidewalks. People can be fined $500 per day for violations. During a typical year, about 40 percent of the state’s total water supply comes from groundwater. The supply decreases and the demand of course increases in the summer months when there is less rain and snowmelt available. Experts predict increased temperatures, less snow, earlier snowmelt and a rise in sea level could have major implications in the future for water supply, flood management, and ecosystem health. So the plan is to conserve and plan for new developments in water conservation like Recycling Wastewater and Flood Management in South Western states like Nevada, Arizona, and California. On average, 75 % of California’s annual precipitation is made up of rain, snow, and hail falling in November and March. The bulk of this precipitation occurs in just three months December, January, and February when California tends to get a small number of large winter storms called atmospheric rivers. A handful of atmospheric rivers or lack thereof during the winter season can determine if the year will be wet or dry. The state of California works diligently to balance the needs of multiple interests, climate change, and relentless population growth that is expected to grow to 45 million by 2035. Californians, too, are paying close attention to their water resources and have passed bond measures to help maintain the system. Change is not coming anytime soon. Groundwater is a vital resource in California. It sustains their ecosystems, supports our agriculture, fuels our economy, quenches our thirst, and reduces the impacts of drought and our changing climate. Groundwater accounts for 40 percent of the State’s total annual water supply in normal years and almost 60 percent in drought years. This is why the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) this precious resource is measured daily by sites like California’s Groundwater Live in conjunction with the public release of information that is constantly changing. Measurements of Domestic, Irrigation and Public Supply Wells along with Dry Wells are recorded and monitored 24/7. The information and data are shared statewide, collected, and kept by the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), which was born in 2014. Real-time information and data are also collected by the California Department of Water Resources on updated statistics on weather, rivers, Reservoirs Data, and Dams throughout the state that is online and instantly available. The Current conditions of Major Public Wells. Lower-than-normal water levels in reservoirs mean that California will produce just half the hydroelectric power of a typical year, the Energy Department warned on Wednesday. There is the risk of power outages and blackouts across the southwest along with the coastal fires that California is unfortunately accustomed to that seem to go hand in hand with dry heat throughout the region. Local agencies that fail to meet the state’s reduction goals are fined up to $2,000 per acre-foot of water. An acre-foot is about 326,00 gallons. The district will monitor water usage, and if the restrictions don’t work it could order a total ban on outdoor watering in the affected areas as soon as September. California receives 75 percent of its rain and snow in the watersheds north of Sacramento. However, 80 percent of California’s water demand comes from the southern 2/3 of the state. California has been called the most hydraulically altered landmass on the planet and for good reasons. Where deserts and plains were once prevalent now reservoirs store water to move it to the arid land. This whole region in the Southwest works like a critical balance between a desert and a thriving developed area. The state of California has two sources of water: surface water and groundwater. The water that runs into rivers, lakes, and reservoirs is called surface water. The Groundwater that is found beneath the earth’s surface in the pores and spaces between rocks and soil underground are called aquifers. Most of California’s precipitation falls as snow in the higher elevation of the northern part of the state during the winter. The snow acts as a natural reservoir, storing water until the spring runoff. After initial evaporation, percolation into the ground, and transpiration, the water flows into streams and rivers and makes its way toward the ocean or into salt sinks. Most of the precipitation falls in the winter as rain and snow. Although the climate is variable, the state receives about 200 million acre-feet of precipitation per year on average. An acre-foot of water equals about 326,000 gallons or enough water to cover an acre of land (the size of a football field) 1 foot deep. One acre-foot is enough water to meet the annual indoor and outdoor needs of two households. Despite the geographic and hydrologic challenges, California has more irrigated acreage than any other state, thanks to massive water projects that include dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, and canals to deliver water to users, especially in the central and southern portions of the state. Northern California receives 100 inches or more of precipitation per year, the state’s southern, drier areas receive less precipitation, just a few inches of rain annually, and depend mostly on the northern precipitation to bring the water to them.

Everyone from Apple CEO Tim Cook to the head of the NCAA slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week, warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. But it was the opposition from Walmart, the ubiquitous retailer that dots the American landscape, that perhaps resonated most deeply, providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland. Walmart's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of Arkansas came after the company said in February it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage. Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals. And some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who famously called on the GOP to \"be the party of Sam's Club, not just the country club,\" told CNN that Walmart's actions \"foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move.\" \"The Republican Party will have to better stand for\" ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry. The party's leaders must be \"willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians.\" Walmart, which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas, emerged victorious on Wednesday. Hours after the company's CEO, Doug McMillon, called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed. Walmart's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support. In 2004, the Walmart PAC gave around $2 million to Republicans versus less than $500,000 to Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. That gap has grown less pronounced in recent years. In 2014, the PAC spent about $1.3 million to support Republicans and around $970,000 for Democrats. It has been a gradual transformation for Walmart. In 2011, the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity. Two years later, the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014. Retail experts say Walmart's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base, as well as a recognition of the country's increasingly progressive views of gay equality (support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59%, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll). \"It's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position,\" said Dwight Hill, a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. \"But in the world of the largest retailer in the world, that's very different.\" Hill added: Same-sex marriage, \"while divisive, it's becoming more common place here within the U.S., and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer.\" The backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality. After Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, signed his state's religious freedom bill into law, CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state. The resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions, including Bill Oesterle, CEO of the business-rating website Angie's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state's passage of the religious freedom act. NASCAR, scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer, also spoke out against the Indiana law. \"What we're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business,\" said Jason Rahlan, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign. The debate has reached presidential politics. National Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination. Likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush initially backed Indiana's religious freedom law and Pence, but moderated his tone a few days later. The former Florida governor said Wednesday that Indiana could have taken a \"better\" and \"more consensus-oriented approach.\" \"By the end of the week, Indiana will be in the right place,\" Bush said, a reference to Pence's promise this week to fix his state's law in light of the widespread backlash. Others in the GOP field are digging in. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate, said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law. \"I think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda,\" Cruz said. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who previously served on Walmart's board of directors, called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill, saying it would \"permit unfair discrimination\" against the LGBT community. Jay Chesshir, CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas, welcomed Hutchinson's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state's bill. He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies. \"When it comes to culture and quality of life, businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that's its people,\" Chesshir said. \"Therefore, when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things, then the business community will again speak and speak loudly.\"\n"], "model_retrieved_documents": ["Walmart CEO Doug McMillon responds to Arkansas senate's approval of the bill. — -- Walmart CEO Doug McMillon is asking Arkansas Gov.

On Tuesday, Arkansas lawmakers passed the Republican-backed Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which says \"governments should not substantially burden the free exercise of religion without compelling justification.\" Technology company Acxiom (ACXM), a major employer in Arkansas, has joined Walmart (WMT) and Apple (AAPL) in opposing the measure, which now heads to Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has said he will sign it into law. A spokesperson for Hutchinson said the governor would comment on the measure on Wednesday. Proponents say a business should not be required to cater same-sex weddings, for instance, if it violates the owner's religious views; critics say it would let businesses deny service or otherwise discriminate against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered community. In a statement, Little Rock-based Acxiom called on Hutchinson to veto the measure, it a \"deliberate vehicle for enabling discrimination.\" Telling CBS MoneyWatch that the issue is a matter of \"human rights,\" Acxiom's chief legal and ethics officer, Jerry Jones, noted that the measure is being considered in a state that was the scene for some of the biggest battles during the Civil Rights era. Acxiom's opposition follows criticism of the proposal by Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart. The measure \"sends the wrong message about Arkansas, as well as the diverse environment which exists in the state,\" Walmart spokesman Lorenzo Lopez wrote Tuesday in an email. \"[T]he whole thing very much hinges on the governor's popular appeal,\" Janine Parry, a professor at the University of Arkansas and director of the Arkansas Poll, said in an email. \"The economic argument -- especially coming from inside his own house -- is opponents' best shot at giving him enough cover to somehow soft-peddle the matter, a la the Indiana governor.\" In a nationally televised news conference Tuesday, Mike Pence, Indiana's Republican governor, argued that opponents had overstate the legislation's impact, but called on his legislature to \"fix\" the law to make it clear that it remained illegal to discriminate against anyone. The measure is based on a federal law of the same name and that other states have passed similar bills without incident, Larry Page of the conservative Arkansas Faith & Ethics Council, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding: \"Where are the horror stories?\" Gay rights groups in Arkansas gotten support from other members of the business community and have compiled a list of more than 100 firms that have pledged to serve everyone equally. Some were at a rally Monday at the state capital in Little Rock protesting the bill. \"We hope that our elected officials seriously weigh possible consequences, both intended and unintended, of their decisions regarding this matter,\" Jennifer Pierce, the head of Arkansas Pride, wrote in an email. Randy Zook, the head of the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce and the Associated Industries of Arkansas said there was a \"wide range of opinions\" among his members. \"We are trying to be as constructive as possible,\" Zook said. \"At this point, we don't have a statement to make.\" The University of Arkansas System, another major employer in the state, declined comment on the bill. Dillard's (DDS), a retailer based in Little Rock, did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment and Union Pacific (UNP), which also has a large presence in the state, said it had no position on the legislation.

Legal Statement.", "The state’s and country’s largest private employer is one of several Arkansas-based companies to pressure Governor Asa Hutchinson to not sign bill into law Walmart, the US’s largest private employer, came out swinging on Tuesday against state legislation legalising discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, calling the move against its “core basic beliefs”. The retail giant is headquartered in Arkansas which on Monday followed Indiana in passing a bill – HB1228 – that allows individuals to discriminate against LGBT people if they feel doing so would “substantially burden” their religious freedom. “Every day, in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve. It all starts with the core basic belief of respect for the individual. And that means understanding and respecting differences and being inclusive of all people. While HB1228 will not change how we treat our associates and operate our business, we feel this legislation is counter to this core basic belief and sends the wrong message about Arkansas, as well as the diverse environment which exists in the state,” Walmart senior director of communication Lorenzo Lopez said. The company employs 1.3 million people across the US and is the largest private employer in Arkansas, where the chain was founded in 1962. Walmart had voiced its concerns about the legislation ahead of Tuesday’s vote. The statement will increase pressure on Governor Asa Hutchinson not to sign the bill into law. On Monday, Scott Howe, the CEO of Acxiom, a big data company also based in the state and one of its largest employers, wrote to Hutchinson: “Simply stated, this bill inflicts pain on some of our citizens and disgrace upon us all.” The bill has also condemned the legislation, as has the mayor of Little Rock, the state’s capital. “Any piece of legislation that is so divisive cannot possibly be good for the state of Arkansas and its people. With these kind of ‘wedge issues’, no one is a winner on either side,” Mark Stodola, the Democratic mayor of the state’s biggest city, wrote to Hutchinson, a Republican, Tuesday. Walmart joins Apple, Eli Lilly, Gap, Levi’s, Yelp and other companies in condemning the spread of legislation they argue undermines the rights of their employees. Last week Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted: “Apple is open for everyone. We are deeply disappointed in Indiana’s new law and calling on Arkansas Gov. to veto the similar #HB1228.” In a Washington Post editorial, Cook said there was “something very dangerous happening in states across the country” and decried a “wave of legislation, introduced in more than two dozen states, [that] would allow people to discriminate against their neighbors”.

Critics say the law, similar to the one enacted by the Indiana Legislature and signed by Gov. Mike Pence, would allow for discrimination against gays and lesbians. Also on POLITICO KATIE GLUECK and ADAM B. LERNER The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company says the legislation “threatens to undermine” the state’s inclusive spirit and does not reflect the company’s values. “Every day in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve,” Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillan said in a statement posted to Twitter. “It all starts with our core basic belief of respect for the individual. Today’s passage of HB1228 threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold.” Others objecting to Arkansas’ House Bill 1228 include the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce and the Little Rock Conventions and Visitors Bureau, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Numerous businesses and prominent figures have also expressed concern with Indiana’s religious freedom law, including the National Football League, NASCAR, National Basketball Association, Women’s National Basketball Association and the NCAA, which hosts the men’s Final Four at Indianapolis’ Lucas Oil Stadium on Saturday. Also on POLITICO KENDALL BREITMAN Pence said Tuesday that he expects clarifications to the law on his desk by the end of the week. “I’ve come to the conclusion that it would be helpful to move legislation this week that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses the right to discriminate against anyone,” he said. Unlike the Indiana law, the Arkansas bill’s sponsors rejected exemptions to the law that would have explicitly banned discrimination against gays and lesbians.

But the nonprofit group Partners in Health said the patient was one of their staffers. \"A Partners In Health clinician working in Sierra Leone has tested positive for the Ebola virus. Our colleague remains in good spirits and has been transferred to the United States for treatment,\" the group said on its website. CDC said Friday that another American who was in close contact with the patient would be evacuated and monitored for the 21-day incubation period for Ebola near Emory University Hospital, which has a special isolation unit. Now there are more. “Currently, none of these individuals have been identified as having Ebola virus disease.\" “As a result of CDC's ongoing investigation, CDC and the State Department are facilitating the return of additional American citizens who had potential exposure to the index patient or exposures similar to those that resulted in the infection of the index patient,” the agency said in a statement. “Currently, none of these individuals have been identified as having Ebola virus disease,” it added. They’ll go for quarantine near one of three specially outfitted isolation units where Ebola patients have been treated. “Individuals will be transported to the U.S. by non-commercial air transport and will be near the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the National Institutes of Health, or Emory University Hospital,” CDC said. Nebraska Medical Center said it was preparing to receive four people. \"These people have been exposed to the virus but they aren't sick and aren't contagious,\" Dr. Phil Smith, who directs the center's bicontainment unit, said in a statement. \"In the unlikely instance that one of them does develop symptoms, we would take them to the Biocontainment Unit immediate for evaluation and treatment.\" Doctors who have treated Ebola patients say the quicker they get medical care, the more likely they are to survive. “Individuals will follow CDC’s recommended monitoring and movement guidelines, including direct active monitoring and, as appropriate, voluntary self isolation during the 21-day incubation period.

Ebola’s killed more than 10,000 people in West Africa since the epidemic started a year ago, and infected 24,000. CDC teams have been in Sierra Leone helping to set up a trial of a vaccine to prevent Ebola. They’ve been in West Africa for months helping local health officials work to control the epidemic. Partners in Health said it has 2,000 employees working in West Africa, including 600 Ebola survivors and 100 expatriate clinicians.

Hospitals in 27 states alerted the CDC of the possible Ebola cases out of an abundance of caution amid the growing outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Fifty-eight cases were deemed false alarms after CDC officials spoke with medical professions about patient exposures and symptoms, but blood samples for the remaining 10 were sent to the CDC for testing, the agency told ABC News today. Seven of the samples tested negative for the virus and results for the remaining three are pending, the agency said. Once a hospital or state lab notifies the CDC of a possible Ebola case based on travel history and symptoms, CDC officials talk to someone familiar with the suspected patient’s history to determine whether blood testing for the virus is necessary, said CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund. They discuss symptoms and determine whether the patient may have been exposed to the virus. Exposure can happen if the patient is a health care worker, has buried someone with Ebola, has lived in a house with someone who had Ebola or has lived in a place where Ebola is spreading. “If somebody had traveled to Guinea and came back and had a fever and has never been to a place where Ebola is transmitted, there’s no reason to suspect there’s Ebola just because Ebola is circulating in Guinea,” Nordlund said, explaining that the CDC takes suspected cases seriously but has to narrow them down.

She is currently in isolation and awaiting test results from the CDC, according to the department. Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, Johns Hopkins Medicine in Maryland and an undisclosed hospital in Ohio have also tested patients for Ebola over the past several weeks. The CDC has urged health care providers to ask patients about their travel history to help identify potential Ebola cases.

Three more exposed workers are due to arrive back in the United States on Monday. The returning workers are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group. They all had contact with a colleague who’s been diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. While in West Africa, the workers “came to the aid of their ailing colleague,” according to a Partners in Health statement. As the CDC investigates who else might have had contact with the Ebola patient, more workers might be flown back to the United States, according to Skinner. The workers are being housed near hospitals that specialize in treating Ebola patients, and if they show signs of the disease, they’ll be admitted as patients – as was the case with one worker in Nebraska. Nurse who contracted Ebola sues hospital company Four of the clinicians arrived Saturday to housing on the campus of the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, according to spokesman Taylor Wilson. The workers have voluntarily agreed not to leave their housing. “They will be monitored so they’ll stay there,” Wilson said. Another aid worker was flown to Atlanta over the weekend and is being housed near Emory University Hospital, and three more workers are scheduled to arrive in Atlanta on Monday, according to Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Health. As in Nebraska, the workers in Georgia must stay in their housing for 21 days after the date of their exposure to Ebola. “Twice a day, we’ll have visual monitoring either face to face or we’ll Skype with them, or do FaceTime,” Nydam said. “And if it’s Skype or FaceTIme, they’ll have to be in a place where we can clearly identify that they are where they’re supposed to be.” Three more exposed workers arrived Saturday at the National Institute of Health in Maryland. These workers “will remain restricted from public places” and have “limited movement, including no mass transportation,” according to a statement from Christopher Garrett, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Health. The heath care worker with Ebola was in serious condition Friday, the NIH said. Details about the patient’s identity weren’t released.

McLaughlin contributed to this report. © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.", "Discover Thomson Reuters By Umaru Fofana 6 Min Read FREETOWN (Reuters) - A woman who died of Ebola this week in Sierra Leone potentially exposed dozens of other people to the disease, according to an aid agency report on Friday, raising the risk of more cases just as the deadliest outbreak on record appeared to be ending. Just a day earlier, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared that “all known chains of transmission have been stopped in West Africa” after Liberia joined Sierra Leone and Guinea in going six weeks with no reported new cases. The three countries had borne the brunt of a two-year epidemic that killed more than 11,300 people. The WHO warned of the potential for more flare-ups, as survivors can carry the virus for months. But the new case in Sierra Leone is especially disquieting because authorities failed to follow basic health protocols, according to the report seen by Reuters. Compiled by a humanitarian agency that asked not to be named, the document said the victim, Mariatu Jalloh, had come into contact with at least 27 people, including 22 in the house where she died and five who were involved in washing her corpse. But its account suggested others could also be at risk. Jalloh, 22, began showing symptoms at the beginning of the year, though the exact date is unknown, the report states. A student in Port Loko, the largest town in Sierra Leone’s Northern Province, she traveled to Bamoi Luma near the border with Guinea in late December. Sierra Leone’s northern border area, a maze of waterways, was one of the country’s last Ebola hot spots before it was declared Ebola-free on Nov. 7, and contact tracing was sometimes bedeviled by access problems. By the time she traveled back to her parents’ home in Tonkolili district, east of the capital Freetown, using three different taxis, Jalloh had diarrhea and was vomiting, the report said. She sought treatment at the local Magburaka Government Hospital on Jan. 8 where a health worker, who did not wear protective clothing, took a blood sample. It was not immediately clear whether the sample was tested for Ebola. She was treated as an outpatient and returned home, where she died on Jan. 12. Health workers took a swab test of Jalloh’s body following her death, which tested positive for Ebola. “The sample was tested for the first time on Thursday morning – around the same time as the WHO declared the Ebola outbreak over”, said Tim Brooks of Public Health England, the British agency that tested the sample at its lab in Sierra Leone. The missed diagnosis has led to anger in some quarters. Dozens of young people gathered outside the hospital on Friday in a noisy demonstration, some holding placards accusing the health department of negligence. “We are demonstrating because we want the authorities to explain to us why the woman was discharged and allowed to go home, where she died, and her corpse was given to her family to bury. We are now concerned that some family members may have been infected,” said local youth leader Mahmud Tarawally. Asked about apparent errors in handling the case, Sierra Leone health ministry spokesman Sidi Yahya Tunis said that the patient had been tested for the virus and had received treatment in a government hospital. He did not give further details. Information campaigns calling upon residents of Ebola-affected countries to respect government health directives have been largely credited with turning the tide of the epidemic. However, safety measures, particularly a ban on traditional burial ceremonies, have faced stiff resistance at times. The report stated that five people who were not part of Jalloh’s parents’ household were involved in washing her corpse, a practice that is considered one of the chief modes of Ebola transmission. Almost all the victims of the regional epidemic, which originated in the forests of Guinea in 2013, were in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. As of Thursday’s WHO announcement that Liberia had gone 42 days with no new cases, all three nations were apparently Ebola-free. But Liberia had twice been given the all-clear last year, only for a fresh cluster of cases to emerge. And the case in Sierra Leone adds further uncertainty. “It is really important that people don’t understand this 42-day announcement as the sign that we should all just pack up and go home,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said on Friday. “We should stay there and be ready to respond to these possible cases.” Ben Neuman, an Ebola expert and lecturer in virology at Britain’s University of Reading, said: “A hospital in Sierra Leone completely misdiagnosing a case of Ebola, apparently without sending a sample to one of the many testing labs that are being kept open for just this reason is ridiculous -completely unacceptable.” He said Ebola was hard to distinguish from many other diseases that cause pain, fever, diarrhea and vomiting. “The only way to know for sure is by testing whether pieces of the Ebola virus are present in the blood,” Neuman added. “People still make better doctors and nurses than computers, but people will always make mistakes. Unfortunately this mistake is a big one.” Ebola is passed on through blood and bodily fluids, and kills about 40 percent of those who contract the virus. While the WHO has said that another major outbreak is unlikely, it says the risk of flare-ups remains because of the way the virus can persist in those who survive it. Research on survivors has located it in semen, breast milk, vaginal secretions, spinal fluid and fluids around the eyes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning Thursday for clinicians and public health departments in the United States to be on the lookout for cases of a rare Ebola-like virus. The warning is in response to outbreaks of Marburg virus disease, one in Equatorial Guinea and the other in Tanzania -- with neither country reporting outbreaks before this year. So far, no cases have been reported in the U.S. nor have any other outbreaks been reported, but the CDC says the warning \"provides information about these outbreaks to increase awareness of the risk of imported cases in the United States.\" In a press conference on March 21, Tanzania's health minister announced an outbreak among a group of fishermen. Of the eight cases, five were fatal. Meanwhile, in Equatorial Guinea, there have been 14 confirmed cases since Feb. 7, with 10 of the patients dying, according to the CDC. Currently there is no evidence that the outbreaks in the two countries are related, and they appear to be independent clusters in which the virus spilled over from animals to humans, the federal health agency said. Marburg virus disease is a rare illness caused by the Marburg virus, which is a so-called cousin of Ebola virus. The first cases were identified in European laboratory workers who were handling African green monkeys imported from Uganda. The virus can spread either from animals to humans or via person-to-person contact either through contact with infected blood or other fluids or objects contaminated with those fluids. According to the CDC, the incubation period -- the time between infection and onset of symptoms -- can last anywhere from two to 21 days. A person is not contagious until symptoms appear, which can include sudden fever, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, loss of appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms, or unexplained bleeding. The CDC says doctors should screen for the disease if someone has symptoms and may have been exposed to the virus while in an affected area -- such as if they attended a funeral or visited a healthcare facility. The disease can cause serious complications include internal bleeding and organ damage. \"Clinical diagnosis of Marburg virus disease be difficult,\" the CDC said. \"Many of the signs and symptoms of MVD are similar to other infectious diseases (such as malaria or typhoid fever) or viral hemorrhagic fevers that may be endemic in the area (such as Lassa fever or Ebola). This is especially true if only a single case is involved.\" There is currently no known treatment for the disease with therapies focused on supportive measures such as balancing fluids, maintaining oxygen levels and blood pressure. According to the World Health Organization, past outbreaks have had case fatality rates of between 24% and 88% with an average rate of 50%. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"], "facts": [{"Question": "How many Americans were monitored for three weeks at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital?", "Answer": "Five Americans were monitored for three weeks at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital."}, {"Question": "Where were the five Americans exposed to Ebola?", "Answer": "The five Americans were exposed to Ebola in West Africa."}, {"Question": "What was the purpose of monitoring the five Americans at the Nebraska Medical Center?", "Answer": "The five Americans were under observation at the Nebraska Medical Center as a precautionary measure following their potential exposure while working in locations where Ebola is endemic."}, {"Question": "What is the name of the hospital where the five Americans were monitored?", "Answer": "The hospital is the Nebraska Medical Center."}, {"Question": "What is the name of the medical director of the biocontainment unit at the Nebraska Medical Center?", "Answer": "The medical director's name is Dr. Angela Hewlett."}, {"Question": "How long did the five Americans stay at the hospital?", "Answer": "The five Americans stayed at the hospital for three weeks."}, {"Question": "Did the five Americans show any signs of Ebola?", "Answer": "No, the five Americans did not show any signs of Ebola."}, {"Question": "What did Dr. Hewlett praise the patients for?", "Answer": "Dr. Hewlett praised the patients for their cooperation during the monitoring period."}, {"Question": "What did Dr. Hewlett state about the patients' stay?", "Answer": "Dr. Hewlett stated that all of them remained asymptomatic throughout their stay."}, {"Question": "What is the significance of the five individuals not developing Ebola?", "Answer": "The fact that none of these individuals developed Ebola is a testament to their commitment to following the strict infection control protocols in place."}, {"Question": "What will the five individuals be able to do now?", "Answer": "The five individuals will now be able to return to their daily lives, relieved of the fear of having contracted the virus."}, {"Question": "What is the risk of transmission in a situation like this?", "Answer": "The risk of transmission was low due to the diligent monitoring and isolation procedures in place."}, {"Question": "What is the ongoing threat in certain parts of the world?", "Answer": "The ongoing threat is Ebola in certain parts of the world."}, {"Question": "What do health officials continue to emphasize?", "Answer": "Health officials continue to emphasize the importance of preparedness and early detection in dealing with outbreaks of infectious diseases."}, {"Question": "What does the successful monitoring of these individuals highlight?", "Answer": "The successful monitoring of these individuals highlights the effectiveness of established protocols in preventing the spread of deadly pathogens."}, {"Question": "What does the experience in Omaha serve as?", "Answer": "The experience in Omaha serves as a valuable lesson in the containment and management of infectious diseases."}, {"Question": "What does the experience in Omaha underscore?", "Answer": "The experience in Omaha underscores the need for continued vigilance and collaboration in tackling global health challenges to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals worldwide."}]}

Gordon Getty is the San Francisco billionaire scion of the late J. Paul Getty, whose oil fortune made his family among the richest in U.S. history. Andrew Getty's death appeared to be from natural causes, Los Angeles County coroner's Assistant Chief Ed Winter said, but it has been initially called an accident because of medication found at the scene. He said coroner's officials need to wait for the results of further examination and toxicology tests, which could take up to 10 weeks to process. \"The tentative information that we do have is that he was not feeling good for the last couple months,\" Winter said Tuesday night, \"and he supposedly had an appointment tomorrow with a personal physician.\" A woman called to report someone had died and sent officers to the gated, century-old home in the hills popular with the film industry elite shortly after 2:15 p.m. They found a man dead in a bathroom, police spokesman Jack Richter said. The caller was cooperating with the investigation, but Richter said he did not know her identity. She was not arrested. Sources told CBS News the woman was a former girlfriend of Getty, but police wouldn't confirm that detail. \"She's the individual that reported the death investigation to us and is a friend of the decedent,\" Los Angeles Police Capt. William Hayes told reporters. \"At this point in time I can't say that there's even a criminal nexus to this investigation.\" Getty is one of four sons of Gordon Getty, who is one of five sons of J. Paul Getty, founder of the Getty Oil Co. who died in 1976 at age 82. J. Paul Getty was an avid collector of art and antiquities, and the Getty name is perhaps best known in the Los Angeles area for the museum that houses much of it, along with many other high-priced artworks bought since his death. Another Getty grandson, J. Paul Getty III, lost an ear in a grisly kidnapping in Rome when he was a teenager. The family reportedly stalled on paying a ransom, and the kidnappers cut off part of his ear, sending the severed organ to a newspaper to prove they had taken him captive. The oil heir, then 16, was freed after five months in captivity and a payment of $2.7 million. He died in 2011 at age 54. First published on April 1, 2015 / 10:24 AM EDT © 2015 CBS Interactive Inc.

At the time, attending paramedics found Getty bleeding from a ‘traumatic injury to the rectal area’ and suffering from blunt-force trauma. Andrew Getty was a cokehead says source. Pictures: Lanessa Grace. Is Andrew Getty’s girlfriend a suspect? Andrew Getty, oil heir dead. Who caused his rectal injuries? In deeming the cause of death, the Los Angeles County Coroner’s office concluded the cause of Andrew Getty’s death was the result of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, with excessive meth use as a contributing factor. The heir’s autopsy revealed at the time of his death, the billionaire had toxic levels of the drug in his system as he lay in a pool or his own blood emanating from his rectum. According to officials, Getty’s ex-girlfriend Lanessa DeJonge (also known by her stage name, Lanessa Grace) was at Getty’s home when he collapsed. She would in turn tell cops the 47-year-old oil heir was a meth addict and had an eight ball a day habit. The coroner’s report obtained by TMZ also showed that Getty had a stockpile of controlled substances at his home, including the ADHD drugs Adderall and Concerta, the painkiller Norco, as well as anabolic steroids Dainabol and Trenabol. Adding intrigue is at the time of Getty’s death, cops recovered two suspicious text messages from his cellphone from a person named Robby. Read one of the messages: ‘ Lemme know if you need something. Imma grabbing the good stuff in a minute.’ The second message declared: ‘It’s a good batch, my man.’ Investigators have not publicly identified the author of the two messages. Prior to the oil heir’s death, Lanessa DeJonge’s mother claimed that Getty had been diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and had not been eating or sleeping well in the days before his collapse. Sources would also reveal that the oil heir having a rapacious drinking and cocaine habit Told the source at the time via the UK’s dailymail: ‘I’ve seen him twice in the last three months. Last month, we were all out on a boys night and ended up late at Andrew’s house, the one on the hill. ‘It was a hard party, I’m not going to lie to you. Rails and rails of coke and drinking to excess. [Other friends] were with me. It was a do-it-till-dawn kind of night. ‘We went to school together and sometimes get together to go excessive,’ said the friend who wished to remain nameless, but is the son of a Hollywood bigwig. ‘Then about three months ago we went to Vegas to play Sports Book. He’s friends with [Steve] Wynn who gave him a suite that took up half a floor at Encore. We never left it, except to gamble our winnings. ‘Andrew was a great guy but massive partier and that’s well known. He took drugs to such an excess that I wouldn’t be surprised if his heart just gave out. He was having stomach problems, but it was bowel problems. ‘The blow [cocaine] was giving him irritable bowls so he’d go from painful constipation to bloody diarrhea. He was complaining about blood in his stool, so he’d had that for a while. ‘He blamed it on the coke use, actually. But Andrew mixed drugs so often and so much that I’m not sure how he can sort out which drug was doing which bit of damage to his body,’ said the friend. ‘He never really worked. He did whatever he liked. His whole family, all the kids, partied their lives away. All of them. Just too much money and too much time and no real focus or desire or ambition like their fathers and grandfather.’ Whilst Getty would be found by De Jonge at the time of his death, Getty had taken out a restraining order two weeks prior against the 32-year-old actress, whom he dated for four years. Prior to the man’s death, the woman had been arguing with the man, insisting he see a doctor regarding ‘painful bowel movements.’ According to details from the court order against her, the restraint order asserted that the actress was putting Getty at ‘grave risk‘ because his serious medical condition could be ‘aggravated by extreme stress.’ At the same time, a source told TMZ that the actress, aware of Getty’s health concerns, was extorting him for money. Reiterated a source, an old school friend of the heir: ‘All I know is that the fights, when they were high, were long and painful to him. That’s all he really said. ‘He seemed exhausted by it all. Exhausted with this girl but she wouldn’t give him up, so that caused him stress. That’s all I know.’ Corroborating tensions between the couple, the LAPD revealed being called to Getty’s Mulholland Drive home more than 30 times in the past, mostly for domestic disturbances. Nevertheless, assistant Chief Ed Winter, of the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office would dismiss any foul play as questions were initially asked as to why DeJonge came to be at the heir’s house despite a restraint order. That said, public records reveal the former actress/model being arrested in Beverly Hills on October 22, 2014, for trespassing, obstruction and battery on a peace officer/emergency personnel. Records also revealed the woman having numerous arrests for harassment and disorderly conduct.", "Watch CBS News June 17, 2015 / 11:12 AM EDT / AP LOS ANGELES - Andrew Getty, an heir to the Getty oil fortune, died from an ulcer-related hemorrhage but he also had a toxic level of methamphetamine in his body, according to an autopsy report obtained Tuesday. Getty, 47, was found dead on the bathroom floor of a bedroom in his Studio City hillside home on March 31, several days after he was last seen alive. His body and the area were bloody but investigators said there were no signs of foul play. Getty's personal assistant told investigators that Getty had complained of stomach pain for the past two months and the assistant had scheduled a doctor's appointment for him on April 1 - one day after his body was discovered. The death was ruled accidental by the Los Angeles County coroner's office. An April 2 autopsy report concluded that Getty died from a gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to duodenal ulcers but \"acute methamphetamine intoxication\" and atherosclerotic heart disease - hardening of heart arteries - were contributing factors. Getty's on-again, off-again girlfriend, who found his body, told authorities that he took methamphetamine daily and the coroner's report said testing found the level of methamphetamine in his blood was in the \"toxic range.\" \"Methamphetamine is a known cardiac central nervous stimulant,\" said the report, which was made final on June 12 and obtained by The Associated Press on Tuesday. It was first reported Tuesday by TMZ.com. Methamphetamine, prescription drugs and drug paraphernalia were found in the home. The reclusive Getty had said in recent court documents that he was battling a \"serious medical condition\" that could endanger his life. He obtained a restraining order earlier this year against his girlfriend, Lanessa DeJonge, noting her behavior and arguments between them, and expressing concern that \"heated arguments can cause my blood pressure to rise dangerously.\" Getty wasn't the first heir of the oil tycoon to die in middle age. His cousin, J. Paul Getty III, was kidnapped in Italy in 1973 and the kidnappers cut off the 16-year-old's ear. The oil baron eventually paid a ransom reported to be $3 million. Once released, the teenager resumed a jet-set lifestyle of abusing drugs and consorting with rock stars until he suffered a debilitating stroke in his 20s. He died in 2011 at age 54. His stepmother, actress Talitha Pol, who had lived her own jet-set life, died of a heroin overdose in 1971. \"The story of the famed Getty family is one of the most obvious examples that money, cold hard cash, doesn't buy happiness,\" Forbes Magazine reported in a profile last year when it listed the combined family fortune at $5 billion - 54th highest on its list of America's most wealthy.

His personal assistant told investigators Getty had been complaining of stomach pains and was booked to see a doctor the following day. The Los Angeles County coroner's report ruled Getty's death an accident as a result of the hemmorhage due to duodenal ulcers. A \"toxic\" level of meth and heart disease were contributing factors, according to the report.

The story ticked off items on Pence's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed Koch brothers, as well as other right-wing lobbying groups. Last August the Indiana governor was in Dallas for an Americans for Prosperity event; the group is backed by the conservative Koch brothers, and supported Gov. Pence's tax-slashing budget. Now, Pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians.  Why would Pence ignore the pleas of Indiana's Chamber of Commerce as well as the Republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill? Because there's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was Pence's way of shoring up his street cred. It is also the reason why Republican Jeb Bush, Pence's fellow White House hopeful, who is viewed as a little light in that category, was first to rush in to defend Pence and the law. One lesson here: Just because more than 70% of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70% of the country is happy about it. Backlash aside, the fact is Pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives. And while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump, the very public debate that now embroils him — and Arkansas Gov.  Asa Hutchinson, and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire Republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped. Pence: 'Was I expecting this kind of backlash? Heavens no.' For there is no way a Republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing LGBT rights, which unfortunately will turn numerous Americans into single-issue voters. I foolishly hoped the issue of LGBT rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election, overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy. Instead it looks like it's going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan's \"cultural war\" speech, during which he told the 1992 Republican National Convention: \"We stand with (George H.W. Bush) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women\" and later followed with \"There is a religious war going on in this country. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War itself. For this war is for the soul of America.\" Progressives may enjoy watching Pence's temporary fall from grace, but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the GOP table. And even if you think neither Pence nor Bush nor Cruz will win the nomination, someone has to. In light of that, listen to conservative former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a potential 2016 candidate describing  conservatives' discomfort with same-sex marriage: \"It's like asking someone who's Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli.\" Or Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal: \"I certainly will support Ted Cruz and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage.\" Or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has a long history of fighting against same-sex marriage and civil unions. And Ben Carson said jail turns people gay, so there's that. Remember: Pence didn't act alone. He only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials. In fact, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, \"the Indiana RFRA [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate. Numerous other bills specifically single out the LGBT community for unequal treatment.\" Who supports, denounces Indiana law? Gallup Polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly, but the trend on the state level tells a different story. Perhaps we're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases. Or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated. Former Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the first member of Congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office, said he believes Republicans want the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the GOP primary. \"We're winning,\" he told a crowd in Chicago recently while promoting his latest book. I guess if you look at where the country was on LGBT issues 10 years ago, we definitely are. That's assuming you are part of the \"we\" who believe LGBT people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. But as the situation in Indiana has shown, \"winning\" should not be mistaken for having \"won.\" For it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called \"religious freedom\" bills snaking through red-state legislatures. Or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop, especially with Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate. Pence, and to a lesser extent, Jeb Bush, may be toxic now but America has a short attention span. More importantly, they are not alone. Frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets, and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls. If that holds true in 2016, \"winning\" is going to feel very strange.\n"], "model_retrieved_documents": ["Five new Indiana laws focused on transgender issues and other LGBTQ concerns will all be in effect by July 1.

LZ: Barney Frank may say LGBT rights 'winning,' but Indiana law pushing them back, and other states' anti-LGBT moves, a bad sign Cruz, Huckabee, Jindal, Carson, Walker and some state judges rulings, feel like 2016 reviving culture wars, he says Barney Frank, to say the least, knows his way around politics. In a Chicago appearance recently, the retired congressman had the sold-out crowd at the Center on Halsted well entertained as he detailed his 45-year journey in public service. Frank, you’ll recall, was the first member of Congress to marry someone of the same-sex while in office, and among other things, he had some choice words for closeted politicians who vote against LGBT rights. And when someone in the audience asked his thoughts about a current ballot proposal in California that would legalize killing gay people, he said he wasn’t aware of the measure but told the young man not to “worry yourself about the crazy people.” “We’re winning,” he said before joking that the name of the California proposal – “The Sodomite Suppression Act” – sounded like a porno. “We’re winning” is a phrase I’ve heard a lot recently as it pertains to LGBT rights. And I guess if you look at where the country was 10 years ago, we definitely are. That’s assuming you are part of the “we” that believes LGBT people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. Or at least not “be put to death by bullets to the head or by any other convenient method” as the California proposal suggests. (It’s unclear whether Matt McLaughlin, the Huntington Beach lawyer who submitted the proposal, is being sincere or just an ass, but the fact remains that if he collects enough signatures there appears to be no legal way of stopping it from going on the ballot.) Frank’s “we’re winning” declaration was oddly timed, too. Less than 24 hours after his talk, the governor in the next state over signed an anti-LGBT “religious freedom” bill into the law – one that allows businesses to challenge in court local laws that forbid discriminating against customers based on sexual orientation. “Many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action,” Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said. Not to be outdone, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he would sign a similar bill that is expected to reach his desk shortly. So we have: A fledgling proposal to kill the gays out West, laws to deny us goods and services in the heartland, and if the rhetoric of 2016 hopeful Ted Cruz is a barometer, a federal ban on same-sex marriage still on the GOP table. Like others, I had foolishly hoped the upcoming general election would be one defined by bold ideas. Instead, it looks like it’s going to be dragged down to a replay of Pat Buchanan’s “cultural war” speech, during which he told the 1992 Republican National Convention: “We stand with (George H.W. Bush) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women” and later followed with “There is a religious war going on in this country. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War itself. For this war is for the soul of America.” Progressives enjoyed poking fun at Cruz, the tea party darling when he announced his presidential bid, but according to the American Civil Liberties Union, “the Indiana RFRA [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate. Numerous other bills specifically single out the LGBT community for unequal treatment.” Alabama judge: This is about sexual preference It’s not just lawmakers. Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore made headlines for telling state officials and judges to disregard a federal court ruling that overturned the state’s ban on same-sex marriage. And this week. a federal judge in Cruz’s home state of Texas blocked a federal rule that would have granted married, same-sex couples access to the Family and Medical Leave Act, a law that helps employees stay home to take care of a severely ill spouse. It seems clear that even if Cruz doesn’t capture the GOP nomination, whoever does will undoubtedly make some concessions to appease LGBT rights backlash currently underway in conservative states. That could include one of Cruz’s agenda items: a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, usurping whatever ruling comes out of the Supreme Court in June, when the court is expected to rule on whether such marriage is constitutionally protected. And the NCAA can issue strongly worded statements, as it did over Indiana’s new anti-LGBT law, and – along with others in corporate America – can threaten financial repercussions for discriminatory laws. But at the end of the day, it’s about votes. Frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets, and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls. If that holds true in 2016, “winning” is going to feel very strange. Indeed, most 2016 hopefuls on the right have been reluctant to express support for same-sex marriage. According to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, “it’s like asking someone who’s Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli.” Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said, “I certainly will support Ted Cruz and others that are talking about making … a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage.” Ben Carson apologizes for comments on gay people Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has a long history of fighting against same sex marriage and civil unions. And Ben Carson said jail turns people gay, so there’s that. (He later apologized) Gallup polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly, but the trend on the state level tells a different story. Perhaps we’re witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases. Or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated. Barney Frank said he believes Republicans want the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the GOP primary. That may be true, but it’s doubtful that will allow a candidate to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called “religious freedom” bills currently snaking through red-state legislatures. Or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it’s raised in a debate or at a campaign stop – especially with Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate. Once again, our democracy is vexed by a woefully inadequate two-party system. Socially liberal, fiscally conservative independent voters may want to consider the full depth of a candidate’s policies before making a decision, but ultimately it may come down to a single-question: to discriminate against LGBT people or not. Unfortunately, the pending 2016 “cultural war” does not allow for much wiggle room beyond that. I know Frank and others have said “we’re winning” but sitting here, watching the life being sucked out of democracy year in and year out feels more like a defeat than a victory.

Arleigh Rodgers, Associated Press Arleigh Rodgers, Associated Press Leave your feedback INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana House Republicans on Monday approved a bill that would ban all gender-affirming care for minors in the state, sending the measure to Indiana’s Republican governor amid a wave of anti-LGBTQ legislation across the U.S. The House advanced the ban 65-30 after contentious hearings that primarily featured testimony from vocal opponents. The bill would prohibit transgender youth under 18 from accessing hormone therapies, puberty blockers and surgeries in the state. “This is good public policy to protect our children from irreversible, harmful, life-altering procedures,” said bill sponsor Indiana Rep. Joanna King of Middlebury. In many U.S. states, lawmakers are approving or considering laws that target transgender health care and limit competitions open to trans athletes. At least nine states have enacted laws restricting or banning some forms of gender-affirming healthcare for minors: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi, Tennessee, Utah and South Dakota. A proposed ban is pending before West Virginia’s governor, while federal judges have blocked enforcement of laws in Alabama and Arkansas. Opponents of the Indiana bill said the most commonly used treatments banned in the legislation — hormone therapies and puberty blockers — are often life-saving for trans kids. “When I started hormone therapy, it made me feel so much better about myself,” said Jessica Wayner, 16, at a House public health committee hearing earlier this month. READ MORE: How Utah’s new ban on gender-affirming care for minors is affecting trans teens in the state Supporters of the bill voiced concerns about those treatments. Xandra Roberts testified at the public health committee hearing that she detransitioned after living for 10 years as a man. Roberts says she feels lingering effects of testosterone, like facial hair growth. “Too many kids are losing body parts and causing irreversible harm to their bodies and minds,” said Roberts, who was 26 when she began testosterone. Hospital representatives testified that the treatments available to minors are safe and reversible, while surgical procedures that are harder to undo aren’t currently offered to minors anyway. Now the bill goes to Gov. Eric Holcomb, who hasn’t said if he’ll sign or veto it. When asked about the bill on March 17, Holcomb said, “In general, parents not only have a right to their children’s health and well-being, they, in fact, have the responsibility of it.” Last year, Holcomb vetoed a bill banning transgender students from competing in girls school sports that has since become law after Republican legislators voted to override his action. The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana sued to overturn the law but dropped the case when the lead plaintiff, a 10-year-old transgender girl, transferred to a charter school. On Monday, the ACLU of Indiana urged Holcomb to veto the healthcare legislation and promised legal action if it becomes law. “Politicians harm us all when they ignore medical judgment and block access to standard care in favor of discriminatory fearmongering,” said ACLU spokesperson Katie Blair. Republican Reps. Ed Clere of New Albany and Jerry Torr of Carmel joined all 28 Democrats present in voting against the bill. Associated Press writer Tom Davies contributed to this report.

Just a few days ago, Maysak gained super typhoon status thanks to its sustained 150 mph winds. It has since lost a lot of steam as it has spun west in the Pacific Ocean. It's now classified as a tropical storm, according to the Philippine national weather service, which calls it a different name, Chedeng. It boasts steady winds of more than 70 mph (115 kph) and gusts up to 90 mph as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Saturday. Still, that doesn't mean Maysak won't pack a wallop. Authorities took preemptive steps to keep people safe such as barring outdoor activities like swimming, surfing, diving and boating in some locales, as well as a number of precautionary evacuations. Gabriel Llave, a disaster official, told PNA that tourists who arrive Saturday in and around the coastal town of Aurora \"will not be accepted by the owners of hotels, resorts, inns and the like ... and will be advised to return to their respective places.\" Aldczar Aurelio, a meteorologist with the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), said the storm was centered 200 miles southwest of Aurora province as of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) and heading west at a 12.5 mph clip. It's expected to make landfall Sunday morning on the southeastern coast of Isabela province and be out of the Philippines by Monday. Ahead of the storm. Isabela Gov. Faustino Dry III warned Saturday that residents should act as if this will be \"no ordinary typhoon.\" Dry told PNA, \"We do not know what the impact will be once it will make landfall.\"\n"], "model_retrieved_documents": ["Typhoon Maysak, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Julian, was a deadly, damaging and powerful tropical cyclone that struck the Ryukyu Islands and the Korean Peninsula in September 2020. The third typhoon of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season, Maysak formed from a tropical disturbance. The disturbance gradually organized, receiving the name Julian from PAGASA as it became a tropical depression. As the depression strengthened, the JMA subsequently named the system Maysak. Maysak rapidly intensified into a strong typhoon before weakening and making landfall in South Korea. Maysak was the second of three typhoons to affect the Korean Peninsula within two weeks, the others being Bavi and Haishen. It was also responsible for the loss of a livestock carrier Gulf Livestock 1, that sank 100 nautical miles West off from Amami Ōshima, Japan on September 2, 2020, taking 41 out of the 43 crew members on board. Following the impacts of Typhoon Bavi on the Korean peninsula in August 2020, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) began to anticipate the development of a new tropical cyclone with the potential to be stronger and more damaging for the region than Bavi.[1] The KMA assessed a high probability of the storm's development, but noted that its future impacts were uncertain;[2] the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also determined that there was a high likelihood of a \"significant tropical cyclone\" developing.[3] Maysak's precursor disturbance was an area of low pressure over the western Pacific east of the Philippines.[4] At 06:00 UTC on August 27, the Japan Meteorological Agency determined that a nearly stationary tropical depression had formed near 15°N, 132°E.[5] The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system around the same time.[6] The newly formed system was located in an environment conducive to storm development, including warm sea surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear.[7] Clusters of atmospheric convection emerged around the storm's center, comprising formative rainbands wrapping into the developing circulation.[8][9] Early on August 28, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assessed the system as a tropical depression with the local name Julian.[10] At 06:00 UTC, the JMA assessed the tropical depression to have strengthened into a tropical storm, assigning it with the name Maysak. By this time, outflow had become established and curvature of the Maysak's rainbands became apparent on satellite imagery.[11] The storm's cloud tops cooled substantially, indicative of further consolidation of its circulation.[12] Maysak became a severe tropical storm twelve hours later.[13] Maysak became a typhoon by 12:00 UTC on August 29 according to the JMA after developing an eye. The storm also began to move towards the north in response to a nearby subtropical ridge.[14][15][16] On August 30, Maysak's structure became indicative of an impending phase of rapid intensification according to the JTWC.[17] The typhoon developed a central dense overcast that day with an eye embedded within.[18] An approaching trough over eastern China and western Japan caused Maysak to accelerate towards the north as it continued to traverse energetic ocean waters.[19] The typhoon's eye became symmetric and spanned 55 km (34 mi) across.[20] By 21:00 UTC, the eye had contracted to a diameter of 19 km (12 mi). Around that time, the JTWC assessed the typhoon as having one-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (134 mph).[21] At 00:00 UTC on September 1, the JMA determined that Maysak had ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (180 km/h) with gusts of up to 250 km/h (160 mph). The associated barometric pressure was estimated at 935 hPa (mbar; 27.61 inHg).[22][23] Maysak held this intensity as it began to move into a less conducive environment for storm development within the East China Sea.[24] Soon, Maysak began to weaken steadily as it passed the East China Sea, slowing back down to a Category 3 storm. The storm then made landfall near Busan, South Korea at 02:20 KST on September 3 (17:20 UTC on September 2), with 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 155 km/h (96 mph) and the central pressure at 950 hPa[25] equivalent into a Category 2 typhoon. After that, it crossed the Sea of Japan and hitting North Korea into Jilin in northeast China. Soon after, Typhoon Maysak transitioned into an extratropical low in northeast China.[26] The storm affected the eastern parts of South Korea, North Korea, China, and Russia, along with the Ryukyu Islands, causing at least 32 deaths and damage to more than 9,200 houses. Total combined economic losses were anticipated to surpass US$100 million.[27] The JMA urged residents of Okinawa to evacuate in anticipation of a potentially \"major disaster\" from Maysak; 560 people ultimately evacuated.[28][29] The agency also warned of the possibility of tornadoes in the region.[30] Schools, stores, and public offices throughout the prefecture closed. As many as 266 flights linking to Okinawa were cancelled, affecting roughly 9,200 travelers.[28][31][32] The Naha Airport closed its passenger terminal in advance of Maysak.[32] The cancellation of flights at Okinawa also led to the cancellation of 10 percent of departures from Haneda Airport.[33] Kadena Air Force Base was placed on Tropical Cyclone Conditions of Readiness level 1 (TCCOR 1), denoting the onset of destructive winds. Okinawa was buffeted by wind gusts generally ranging between 100 and 130 km/h (62 and 81 mph). A peak gust of 163 km/h (101 mph) was measured in Nanjō.[34] Wind gusts reached 195 km/h (121 mph) at Kumejima Airport.[35] Power outages affected 1,580 electricity customers in Nago, Naha, and Nakijin.[29] Agricultural damage across the prefecture were at JP¥236.4 million (US$2.23 million).[36] Officials in Kyushu warned of strong winds and mudslides. Maysak caused powerful winds and drenching rainfall to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan as it passed through, also causing some power outages.[37] Agricultural damage in Saga Prefecture were calculated to be JP¥609 million (US$5.74 million).[38] On 2 September 2020, Panamanian-flagged cargo ship Gulf Livestock 1 with 43 crew members, including 39 seamen from the Philippines, two from New Zealand and two from Australia, and thousands of cattle onboard was reported missing in the East China Sea. The Japan Coast Guard said it has found one person drifting in rough waters in a lifejacket. A distress signal was sent from the ship shortly before disappearing.[39] The body of a person was found two days later.[40] By October, the remaining 41 seamen were declared dead.[27] In South Korea, 2,200 people were evacuated into shelters in preparation for Maysak. Maysak resulted in two deaths,[41] caused over 120,000 power outages, and damaged over 5,100 hectares of farmland as well as a further 800 structures.[42] South Korea's Ministry of Interior and Safety cited notable damage to nearly 2,000 buildings.[27] Maysak brought heavy rainfall to eastern North Korea peaking at 15.157 inches (385.0 mm) in Wonsan. Photos showed streets and buildings being flooded in the area.[43] North Korea's state television network once more broadcast live storm reports overnight from State Hydro-Meteorological Administration and outside as they had done with Typhoon Bavi just a week previous to Maysak.[44][45] The extratropical remnants of Maysak moved into Jilin, bringing heavy rains to the province. Damage was amounted to be CN¥6.18 million (US$903 thousand).[46] Maysak struck the Primorsky Krai as an extratropical cyclone, which killed three people and led to ₽200 million (US$2.65 million) in losses.[47]", "Tropical Storm Maysak made landfall in the Philippines Sunday after killing at least five people and causing extensive damage in Micronesia. Interior secretary Manuel Roxas II ordered preemptive evacuations Saturday for tourists visiting the northeastern coast of the country, as well as those living in low-lying areas, The Philippine Star reported. The Associated Press repots that over Friday and Saturday, three men drowned in northern Cagayan province, but officials have not decided whether the deaths were related to the approaching storm. \"It's nice to say zero casualties, but it's too early to tell,\" disaster response agency head Alexander Pama told reporters. The most crucial hours of planning occurred Saturday night. As Pama told the Associated Press, \"The critical hours will be in the evening Saturday. We need to double up the preparations because it is harder to move around in the dark.\" (MORE: Here's Where Typhoon Maysak Is Headed Next) Retired army Gen. Jovie Narcise told The Straits Times before Maysak made landfall, fishing boats were drawn from the sea and stored at least 30 meters away from shore to avoid being lost. Multiple people were expected to travel to the country during the Easter holiday weekend, according to the International Red Cross in a CNN.com report. During a press conference, Philippines Social Welfare undersecretary Vilma Cabrera said over 10,000 tourists were warned to avoid the beaches in Aurora province Friday, The Straits Times reported. Other relief agencies have also begun to move supplies into Philippine islands that are expected to be hit hardest. \"UNICEF is ready to support the government with pre-positioned emergency supplies from our local warehouses in Manila, Tacloban, and Cotabato once the emergency hits,\" said UNICEF Philippines representative Lotta Sylwander. Maysak struck Micronesia's Chuuk State on Sunday evening, killing at least five people and demolishing up to 95 percent of tin houses on the island, according to Guampdn.com. Communications systems on the island, which has a population around 50,000, were down this weekend, and the full extent of the damage caused by Maysak's battering winds and rain is still unknown. Kembo Mida Jr., a Chuuk State resident and owner of the L5 hotel, witnessed the storm's destruction first-hand and spoke to Marianas Variety. (PHOTOS: Maysak Commands Respect, Even From Space) \"Yap must prepare. Chuuk was devastated. L5 also suffered damage from wind and flooding throughout the building. Houses were blown away and trees snapped in half. It was very dangerous and scary,\" Mida said. Guampdn.com reports that the Ayuda Foundation is already working to provide aid to Chuuk by filling up a 40-foot container with food and building materials for the island's residents. In a radio broadcast, Federated States of Micronesia public information officer Marz Akapito said that boats would arrive on Chuuk with water bottles and medical supplies. After Maysak passes Yap, other boats will conduct more thorough damage assessments. (INTERACTIVE: Current Satellite Loop of Maysak) Chuuk locals use mango, banana and cocounut trees, many of which were pulverized by Maysak's winds, as a main source of food. \"I was lucky I have a concrete house, unfortunately I (can) not say the same for many of my fellow Chuukese. Ships have sunk. Homes destroyed. Breadfruits, mangoes, bananas and coconuts our local source of food... trimmed down to just stems and branches,\" resident Hiroyuki Mori said.

Maysak, which began as a super typhoon in the Pacific Ocean, reached the northeast coast of the main island of Luzon at 8am with winds of 55km/h. \"As of now, most of our fears have melted away,\" said chief state weather forecaster Esperanza Cayanan shortly after the depression reached Dinapigue, a remote town on Luzon's northeast coast, about 250km from Manila. The government had evacuated more than 25,000 people from coastal villages in the region, while police drove away thousands of tourists from beaches on nearby Aurora province as a precaution against potential tsunami-like waves known as storm surges. The tourists, many of whom had come from Manila and nearby areas to enjoy the long Easter holidays, breathed a sigh of relief and dived back into the still choppy waters on Easter Sunday. \"We made a calculated risk [that Maysak would dissipate] and we got lucky. Prayers also helped,\" Manila-based television producer Rona Agtay, 39, said. State weather forecaster Shelly Ignacio said the super typhoon met unfavourable atmospheric conditions as it approached land, causing the storm system to dissipate dramatically overnight on Saturday. At its current strength, Maysak can break tree branches and may take the roofs off houses made of light materials, while sea travel remains risky for small boats, the state weather service said in its latest bulletin. \"We expect this system to melt away as it crosses the mountains, although there is a small possibility it could survive by the time it hits the water [South China Sea] tomorrow,\" Ignacio said.", ""], "facts": [{"Question": "What warning are Filipinos being given?", "Answer": "Filipinos are being warned to be on guard for flash floods and landslides."}, {"Question": "What is approaching the Asian island nation?", "Answer": "Tropical storm Maysak is approaching the Asian island nation."}, {"Question": "What is the local name for Maysak?", "Answer": "Maysak is known locally as \"Butchoy\"."}, {"Question": "Who issued the alert for the approaching storm?", "Answer": "The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issued the alert."}, {"Question": "What is the storm expected to bring to the region?", "Answer": "The storm is expected to bring heavy rains and strong winds to the region."}, {"Question": "What is the risk of flooding and landslides in vulnerable areas?", "Answer": "The storm poses a significant risk of flooding and landslides in vulnerable areas."}, {"Question": "What have local authorities advised residents to do?", "Answer": "Local authorities have advised residents to take precautionary measures and follow safety protocols to ensure their well-being during the inclement weather."}, {"Question": "What have disaster response teams been placed on standby for?", "Answer": "Disaster response teams have been placed on standby for the approaching storm."}, {"Question": "What are emergency supplies and equipment prepared for?", "Answer": "Emergency supplies and equipment are prepared for deployment in affected areas."}, {"Question": "What are evacuation plans in place for?", "Answer": "Evacuation plans are in place to ensure the safety of residents living in high-risk zones."}, {"Question": "What is the Philippine government urging the public to do?", "Answer": "The Philippine government is urging the public to stay informed through official channels and to heed warnings from local authorities."}, {"Question": "Why is it essential for everyone to be vigilant and proactive in protecting themselves and their communities?", "Answer": "It is essential for everyone to be vigilant and proactive in protecting themselves and their communities from potential harm."}, {"Question": "What should Filipinos do as tropical storm Maysak continues to advance towards the Philippines?", "Answer": "Filipinos should remain vigilant and prepared for any adverse weather conditions that may arise."}, {"Question": "How can individuals help mitigate the impact of the storm and ensure their safety?", "Answer": "Individuals can help mitigate the impact of the storm and ensure their safety by staying alert and taking necessary precautions."}]}

Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. \"He was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition,\" Capt. Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday. That man, Louis Jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He'd been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. \"It took so long,\" Jordan said.  \"It moved so slowly.\" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. His father, Frank Jordan, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. \"He looked good. Hadn't lost too much weight. He wasn't badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be,\" he said. Lost at sea for 66 days. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing. The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. \"I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,\" Jordan said.  \"The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. \"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.\" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jordan came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital about 7:30 p.m. Coast Guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt Jordan's incredible story. They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing. Frank Jordan addressed the skepticism about his son's appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. His son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. Frank Jordan said it was obvious when the Jordans met at the hospital Friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal. \"I know he went through what he went through,\" Frank Jordan said. Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway. He had free rent and free food in the river, he said. But when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. \"He's got a very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,\" Frank Jordan said. \"And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.\" Rescue swimmer Kyle McCollum was the first to care for Jordan on the flight back to land. \"You would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him,\" he said. \"But for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing.\" Grenz was also surprised by Jordan's condition, physically and mentally. The rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days. Jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry. \"We took him to a rescue boat,\" the container ship captain said. \"He was given water and pea soup to gain some power again.\" Derriel Morris, a neighbor at the Bucksport Plantation Marina & RV Resort called Jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat, named \"Angel.\" Morris said: \"It was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. I mean it looked like a brand new sailboat.\" Morris told CNN affiliate WPDE that one day in January he was going to the store and Jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. But when he returned to the marina, Jordan had slipped away. \"There was no shore line, no hose; it was like he was never there,\" Morris told the station. After he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony. The marina's manager, Jeff Weeks, told WPDE that Jordan is expected to be back at Buscksport next week.

Louis Jordan, 36, was reported missing by his father on Jan. 29. He had set sail about a week earlier on the 1950s-era, single-masted sailboat Angel from Bucksport Plantation Marina in Conway, South Carolina. He was found floating on the overturned hull of his vessel by a German cargo ship, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. A Jayhawk helicopter later transported Jordan to Sentara Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia. He was able to stand up and walk without assistance and was later released. Jordan told Coast Guard officials he survived through a combination of rationing the food he had already packed for the journey, drinking rain water and catching fish with a net. He added that his mast broke and his communication gear was damaged in a rough storm. In an emotional telephone call Thursday, Louis Jordan spoke to his father, Frank Jordan, for the first time in more than two months. \"I haven’t heard you in so long,\" Louis Jordan told his father in an audio recording of the conversation released by the Coast Guard. \"Oh man, it’s nice to hear your voice,\" Frank Jordan replied. \"People have been praying for you.\" Missing, now rescued, sailor Louis Jordan walks into Sentara Norfolk. Missing more than 60 days off coast. @WAVY_News pic.twitter.com/ssA7ctvseh Louis Jordan seemed to lament the loss of his 35-foot-vessel, saying to his father: \"I couldn't fix it, I couldn't sail back with my boat — I’m so sorry, it’s such a huge loss.\" Frank Jordan replied: \"Hey Louis, you’re fine, son, I’m so glad that you’re alive. We prayed and prayed and we hoped that you were still alive. So, that’s all that matters.\" Chief Petty Officer Ryan Doss told The Associated Press that \"Angel\" had lost its mast and capsized. The German container ship's crew said it found Jordan sitting on the hull. Doss added it was not known where or how long the boat had capsized. However, Jordan was located some 200 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Jordan had been living on his docked sailboat at the Bucksport Plantation Marina in Conway, South Carolina, until January, when he told his family he was \"going into the open water to sail and do some fishing,\" according to his mother, Norma Davis, of Jacksonville, North Carolina. He set sail on Jan. 23, heading north. The family had not heard from him since, Davis said. \"We expected him to come back and he did not return,\" his mother said in a telephone interview with the AP. \"We knew something happened. To us it's just a miracle. We're just so thrilled that he was found alive.\" Coast Guard Lt. Krysten Pecora said at a news conference outside Sentara Norfolk General Hospital that Jordan’s family was elated and visiting him in the hospital. \"Obviously his family is overjoyed to see him after such a long time out there. I just attribute that to his strength and willingness to live and keep on going,\" Pecora added. \"It’s pretty remarkable.\" Marilyn Fajardo, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard's 7th District, said officials in Miami were notified by Frank Jordan on Jan. 29 that he hadn't seen or heard from his son in a week. One week later, Davis confirmed their son was still missing. Fajardo said alerts were issued from New Jersey to Miami to be on the lookout for Jordan and his sailboat. A search was launched on Feb. 8, but Fajardo said the Coast Guard abandoned its efforts after 10 days. The Coast Guard said Jordan didn't file a \"float plan,\" the nautical equivalent of a flight plan, to determine his route or destination, and Fajardo said there wasn't enough information to narrow down his whereabouts. Officials also searched financial data to determine whether Jordan actually had come ashore without being noticed, but found no indication that he had, Fajardo added.

And then, finally, he was rescued. After Louis Jordan embarked on a fishing trip from South Carolina in January, he said, his sailboat capsized. Jordan said he broke his collarbone and his boat drifted away from the coast. On Thursday, after 66 days at sea, Jordan was picked up by the Coast Guard 200 miles off the North Carolina coast. Jordan was hospitalized with a shoulder injury and dehydration, but he refused treatment and was released early Friday morning, according to the Associated Press, citing the hospital. So how did the 37-year-old survive? When his boat flipped over, Jordan lost most of his equipment, including his captain's log, GPS devices and rice, he said in an interview with ABC News. \"We don't know where he capsized,\" said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Ryan Doss, according to the AP, adding that the Coast Guard will need to talk to him at length to learn more. For Jordan, a key to survival was pancakes. He made two or three of the breakfast staple each day with flour fried in oil. He also caught fish. To drink, Jordan relied on rainwater, which he said tasted like coconut milk. Jordan claimed to have rationed his water to about one pint per day, the AP reported. His father, Frank Jordan, told CNN Thursday he wasn't too worried about his son going without food because he had fasted before. However, he told reporters today, \"Sometimes I cried so much that I thought there just wasn't anything left. \"After about two months I just ... started to think, 'It's over, I lost my son,'\" he added. Jordan said he regularly prayed and read his Bible while at sea. \"He told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time,\" Frank Jordan said to CNN. \"I believe that sustained him.\" The ordeal gave him perspective, Jordan said, adding that he'd like to have children one day. Jordan said he was more worried about his family and friends than himself. \"Their poor hurt feelings: If I’m ever going to show up again or not, not knowing if I abandoned them, that’s really worrying,\" he said.

But Walker's death in November 2013 at the age of 40 sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry and fans worldwide. The fast and furious star tragically passed away in a car accident while filming Furious 7, leaving the film's production in limbo and his co-stars and crew members devastated.\n\nWalker's sudden death shed light on the risks and dangers that actors often face while working on film and television projects. While most on-set accidents are minor or infrequent, there have been other instances where actors have lost their lives during production.\n\nOne of the most notable cases is that of Brandon Lee, the son of legendary martial artist Bruce Lee. Brandon died tragically at the age of 28 while filming the movie \"The Crow\" in 1993. He was accidentally shot on set with a defective prop gun during a scene, highlighting the potential hazards of using weapons in movie productions.\n\nAnother tragic incident occurred during the filming of the World War II drama \"Von Ryan's Express\" in 1965, when actor Edward Mulhare's stunt double, Bill Hickman, was killed in a jeep crash during a chase scene. The loss of a crew member serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in creating high-intensity action sequences for the big screen.\n\nDespite the safety protocols and precautions taken on film sets, accidents can still happen, and the deaths of actors like Paul Walker serve as a sobering reminder of the unpredictable nature of the industry. As fans continue to mourn the loss of their favorite stars, it is crucial for filmmakers and productions to prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone involved in the creative process. Paul Walker's legacy lives on through his work on screen, but his untimely death also serves as a cautionary tale for the entertainment industry to always prioritize safety above all else.", "token_usage": 378, "human_written_evidences": ["\"Furious 7\" pays tribute to star Paul Walker, who died during filming.

But Walker's death in November 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash was especially eerie given his rise to fame in the \"Fast and Furious\" film franchise. The release of \"Furious 7\" on Friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in Hollywood. \"He was a person of humility, integrity, and compassion,\" military veteran Kyle Upham said in an email to CNN. Walker secretly paid for the engagement ring Upham shopped for with his bride. \"We didn't know him personally but this was apparent in the short time we spent with him. I know that we will never forget him and he will always be someone very special to us,\" said Upham. The actor was on break from filming \"Furious 7\" at the time of the fiery accident, which also claimed the life of the car's driver, Roger Rodas. Producers said early on that they would not kill off Walker's character, Brian O'Connor, a former cop turned road racer. Instead, the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes, with Walker's brothers, Cody and Caleb, serving as body doubles. There are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending, in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to Walker while \"retiring\" his character. At the premiere Wednesday night in Hollywood, Walker's co-star and close friend Vin Diesel gave a tearful speech before the screening, saying \"This movie is more than a movie.\" \"You'll feel it when you see it,\" Diesel said. \"There's something emotional that happens to you, where you walk out of this movie and you appreciate everyone you love because you just never know when the last day is you're gonna see them.\" There have been multiple tributes to Walker leading up to the release. Diesel revealed in an interview with the \"Today\" show that he had named his newborn daughter after Walker. Social media has also been paying homage to the late actor. A week after Walker's death, about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in Los Angeles. Most had never met him. Marcus Coleman told CNN he spent almost $1,000 to truck in a banner from Bakersfield for people to sign at the memorial. \"It's like losing a friend or a really close family member ... even though he is an actor and we never really met face to face,\" Coleman said. \"Sitting there, bringing his movies into your house or watching on TV, it's like getting to know somebody. It really, really hurts.\" Walker's younger brother Cody told People magazine that he was initially nervous about how \"Furious 7\" would turn out, but he is happy with the film. \"It's bittersweet, but I think Paul would be proud,\" he said. CNN's Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.\n"], "model_retrieved_documents": ["Furious 7 (also known as Fast & Furious 7) is a 2015 action film directed by James Wan and written by Chris Morgan. It is the sequel to Fast & Furious 6 (2013) and The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), and the seventh installment in the Fast & Furious franchise. The film stars an ensemble cast including Vin Diesel, Paul Walker (in his final film role), Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Tony Jaa, Ronda Rousey, Nathalie Emmanuel, Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham. In the film, Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Walker), and their team are recruited by covert ops leader Mr. Nobody (Russell) to prevent terrorist Mose Jakande (Hounsou) from obtaining a hacking program. Meanwhile, Deckard Shaw (Statham), a former special forces soldier seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother, puts the team in danger once again. Plans for a seventh installment were first announced in February 2012 when Johnson stated that production on the film would begin after the completion of Fast & Furious 6. In April 2013, Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced to direct the film. Casting showed the returns of Diesel and Walker that same month. Principal photography began that September in Atlanta, but was indefinitely suspended in November after Walker died in a car crash; filming resumed in April 2014 and ended in July, with Walker's brothers Caleb and Cody standing-in to complete his remaining scenes, causing delay to its 2015 release date, with other filming locations including Los Angeles, Colorado, Abu Dhabi, and Tokyo. Brian Tyler, who had last composed the score for Fast Five (2011), returned to compose the seventh installment. With an estimated production budget of up to $250 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made. Furious 7 premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on April 1, 2015, and was released in the United States on April 3, by Universal Pictures. The film was a box office success and it received positive reviews from critics for its action sequences and emotional tribute to Walker, with many considering it to be one of the best films in the franchise. It grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, making it the third-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of release. It also set a record for the second-highest opening weekend of its time, grossing $397.6 million worldwide. It was the highest grossing film of 2015 internationally and became the highest-grossing film of the franchise in the first twelve days of its theatrical release. A sequel, The Fate of the Furious, was released in April 2017. After defeating Owen Shaw and securing pardons for their past crimes,[a] Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner and the team have returned to the US to live normal lives. Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory, while Brian accustoms himself to life as a father. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the hospital where the comatose Owen is held in London and vows to take revenge. Deckard breaks into the DSS field office in Los Angeles to extract profiles of Dom's crew, and fights DSS Agent Luke Hobbs before he escapes, detonating a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister, Mia, that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a letter bomb sent by Deckard, who has apparently killed Han Lue in Tokyo,[a] explodes and destroys the Toretto house. Dom meets Hobbs and learns about Deckard before he travels to Tokyo to retrieve Han's body and acquires the objects found at the crash site from Sean Boswell.[b] As Dom, Brian, Tej Parker, and Roman Pearce mourn Han and Gisele Yashar at Han's funeral in Los Angeles, Dom spots Deckard spying on them and confronts him in an underground tunnel, but Deckard flees when a covert ops team, led by government agent Mr. Nobody, arrives and opens fire. Mr. Nobody tells Dom that he will help them in stopping Deckard if he helps him retrieve God's Eye, a computer program capable of tracking a specific individual using anything on a digital network, and save its creator Ramsey from Nigerian terrorist Mose Jakande. The team airdrops their off-road modified cars over the Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakande's convoy, and rescue Ramsey. They leave for the Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi and steal the flash drive containing the God's Eye chip from a billionaire hidden in a Lykan HyperSport. With God's Eye secure, Dom, Brian, Nobody, and his team use it to hunt Deckard down to an abandoned factory but are ambushed by Jakande and his henchmen, who have allied with Deckard, and are forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. As Mr. Nobody is medically extracted, the team returns to Los Angeles where Dom plans to fight Deckard alone, while Letty, Brian, Tej, and Roman resolve to protect Ramsey from Jakande. Later, Brian promises Mia that he will fully dedicate himself to their family after he defeats Deckard and Jakande, and is motivated to come home after Mia reveals her pregnancy. As Jakande pursues Brian and the rest of the team with a stealth helicopter and an aerial drone, Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye. Discovering the situation, Hobbs leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance. After battling and killing Jakande's henchman Kiet, Brian hijacks a signal repeater tower that allows Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Enraged, Jakande decides to kill Dom. Meanwhile, Dom and Deckard engage in a brawl on top of a public parking garage. Jakande intervenes and attacks them both; Dom uses the distraction to defeat Deckard by causing part of the parking garage to collapse beneath him. Dom attempts to crash his Dodge Charger onto Jakande's helicopter; he leaves a bag of grenades on the helicopter and crashes on the rubble of the garage. Hobbs shoots the grenades, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. After Brian and Hobbs help Letty bring out Dom's unconscious body, she cradles him and tells him that she has fully regained her memories and has remembered their wedding, after which Dom regains consciousness. Deckard is arrested by Hobbs and the CIA, being locked up in a black site prison. The rest of the team relaxes on a tropical beach. Brian and Mia play with their son Jack while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey look on, acknowledging that Brian is happily retired with his family. Dom drives away and Brian catches up with him. As Dom recalls his memories with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions.

Both would be written by Chris Morgan and directed by Justin Lin, who had been the franchise's writer and director, respectively, since The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).[22] On December 20, 2011, following the release of Fast Five (2011), Vin Diesel stated that Fast Six would be split into two parts, with writing for the two films occurring simultaneously. On the decision, Diesel said:[23] We have to pay off this story, we have to service all of these character relationships, and when we started mapping all that out it just went beyond 110 pages ... The studio said, 'You can't fit all that story in one damn movie!'[23] However, in an interview on February 15, 2012, Dwayne Johnson stated that the two intended sequels would no longer be filmed simultaneously because of weather issues in filming locations, and that production on Fast Seven would only begin after the completion of Fast Six.[24] In April 2013, during the post-production of the retitled Fast & Furious 6, Lin announced that he would not return to direct the seventh film, as the studio wanted to produce the film on an accelerated scheduled for release in summer 2014. This would have required Lin to begin pre-production on the sequel while performing post-production on Fast & Furious 6, which he considered would affect the quality of the final product. Despite the usual two-year gap between the previous installments, Universal chose to pursue a sequel quicker due to having fewer reliable franchises than its competitor studios.[25] However, subsequent interviews with Lin have suggested that the sixth film was always intended to be the final installment under his direction.[26] In April 2013, Australian director James Wan, predominantly known for horror films, was announced as the sequel's director, with Neal H. Moritz and Michael Fottrell returning to produce and Morgan returning to write the script, his fifth in the franchise. On April 16, 2013, Diesel announced that the sequel would be released on July 11, 2014.[27] In May 2013, Diesel said that the sequel would feature Los Angeles, Tokyo, and the Middle East as locations.[28][29] Principal photography began in early September 2013 in Atlanta, with a casting call issued.[30][31] Abu Dhabi was also a filming location;[32] the production crew chose it over Dubai, as they would benefit from the Emirate's 30% rebate scheme.[33] Pikes Peak Highway in Colorado was closed in September to film some driving sequences.[34] On September 16, the production filmed with Paul Walker and the Kimsey twins, playing his son, Jack,[35] in front of an Atlanta elementary school.[36] Han's funeral scene was filmed at Oakland Cemetery,[37] with extras needed for the scene being \"hot, hip and trendy cool types of all ethnicities between the ages of 18 and 45\".[38] On the evening of September 19, Lucas Black joined the production[39] for his sole scene with Diesel, in an Atlanta parking garage. Separate scenes with Walker also shot in the same location on the same night,[40] including one half of a phone conversation between his character and Jordana Brewster's. On October 24, over a month into the film's production, Johnson tweeted he had started shooting for the film after wrapping up on Hercules.[41] Five days later, Diesel posted the first photo of Johnson on the set, in the hospital scene.[42] On November 30, Walker, who portrayed Brian O'Conner, died in a single-vehicle accident.[43][44] The next day, Universal announced that production would continue after a delay that would allow the filmmakers to rework the film.[45] On December 4, Universal put production on hold indefinitely.[45] Wan later confirmed that the film had not been cancelled.[46] On December 22, Diesel announced that the film would be released on April 10, 2015.[47] On February 27, 2014, The Hollywood Reporter reported that filming would resume on April 1, and that the cast and crew had headed to Atlanta to prepare for about eight more weeks of shooting.[48] Principal photography ended on July 10.[49] The \"airdrop\" sequence was conceived by stunt coordinator, Spiro Razatos, who also supervised on the franchise's two previous installments; Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6.[53][54] Razatos told Business Insider that he wanted to rely more on real stunts rather than CGI because he wanted the whole sequence to \"feel real\" and fulfill audience's expectations.[53] The stunt took months of prep-solving problems. Cameras needed to be mounted onto cars in a way that they would not be destroyed when the cars landed, and the crew had to figure out a safe way to get the cars out of the plane. They performed a dry run with a single car falling out of a plane[53] and did this six times.[54] Cars were dropped from a Lockheed C-130 Hercules high above the Arizona desert, but close up shots that show the cars landing on a mountain road were filmed in Colorado.[54] There were two airplanes, flying at a height of 12,000 feet, each dropping two cars apiece.[53] BRS parachutes enabled with GPS were secured to each of the cars before dropping off the C-130 plane. At about 5,000 feet, the parachutes deployed.[54] Over 10 cameras were used for the sequence. In addition to cameras on the ground, there were cameras remotely operated inside the plane and another three mounted outside each car. Additional cameras were on a helicopter, where Razatos was stationed watching monitors. Three skydivers used in the shoot wore helmet cameras to help shoot the sequence from multiple angles. Sky divers would either jump out before cars or after them.[53] While all the cars landed on their drop zones, 70% landed perfectly and 30% did not.[54] For the close-up scenes which show the actors inside their cars, a giant gimbal with a 360-degree range of movement were attached to each of the cars and was filmed against a green screen to reproduce their tumble through the sky.[55] The last part of the scene, which shows the cars hitting the road was shot separately. To get that right, the team set up a pulley system that had cars six to ten feet above the ground. When they were dropped from the cranes, the stuntmen who were sitting in the driver's seats raced their engines at about 35 to 40 miles per hour and slid to the ground at full speed. Those cranes were then later removed from the film with computers.[54][55] Razatos claims, therefore, that the air drop sequence was \"all real\" and that it would be \"hard to top\".[53][54] The scene featuring Brian jumping off a bus off a cliff was performed by a stuntman and was all done without any computer graphics.[56] The shooting for this particular sequence along with the scene in which Dom and his team are pursuing to rescue Ramsey almost did not happen due to the absence of tax break in Colorado.[56] The studio originally wanted to shoot the sequence in Georgia which provides tax breaks for film productions, and then add woods in the background later in post-production to which Razatos denied saying, \"the audience is going to know [it's CGI] and aren't going to feel good about it.\"[56] Shooting finally took place in Colorado.[56] A total of 340 cars were used in the film,[55] and more than 230 cars were destroyed in the making of the film, including several black Mercedes-Benzes, a Ford Crown Victoria, and a Mitsubishi Montero.[57] The film featured the on-screen destruction of a Lykan HyperSport by W Motors, valued at $3.4 million,[58] though the actual car destroyed was a less expensive model made for the film rather than one of the seven actual production HyperSports.[59] The mountain-highway chase scene on Colorado's Monarch Pass proved to be the most damaging sequence with over 40 vehicles being destroyed.[57][60] Only 10 percent of the action sequences in the film were computer-generated, and even then, much of the CGI was employed simply to erase the wires and other contraptions that were used to film real cars and drivers or to add a background.[55] It took more than 3,500 man-days to complete the various stunts of the film.[55] When I first heard the news, I was shell-shocked like everyone, and it took me days to come to terms with it. And then after that, heartbreaks started sinking in and we realized that Paul [Walker] wasn't going to be around with us anymore moving forward, and it was a really hard one. And finishing the movie was the last thing on my mind at that point. It was more the idea of ... picking up the pieces, going back on set, rallying the team, the cast, and the crew, and as the director, having to put on the brave face and champion and push everyone along. The idea of that was very daunting for me, but it became very apparent to all of us that we needed to finish this movie to honour Paul's legacy and to basically honour his memories ... it was about making this movie for Paul. —James Wan, director of Furious 7[61] In January 2014, Time reported that Walker's character, Brian O'Conner, would be retired instead of killed, and that new scenes would be developed in order to allow the franchise to continue without him.[62] To recreate Walker's likeness, the filmmakers hired Peter Jackson's Weta Digital visual effects house (which had previously produced the imagery of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings franchise and Caesar in the Planet of the Apes franchise).[63] Initially, what Weta could do was severely constrained by the quality of the reference materials available for Walker's physical appearance. In April 2014, it was reported that Walker's brothers Caleb and Cody had been hired as stand-ins.[64] Their strong resemblance to their late brother meant the filmmakers could use scans of their bodies instead of recreating Walker's entire body from scratch. The final film showed Walker's face superimposed over the bodies of his brothers or actor John Brotherton in 350 visual effects shots. 260 used a computer-generated face, while 90 repurposed actual footage of Walker's face borrowed from outtakes or older footage.[63][65][66] The musical score was composed by Brian Tyler, who scored the third, fourth and fifth installments of the series.[67] \"There's an emotional component to Fast & Furious 7 that is unique\", said Tyler about his experience scoring. \"I think people are really going to be amazed by it.\"[68] A soundtrack album to the film was released by Atlantic Records on March 17, 2015,[69] while Tyler's score was released by Back Lot Music on March 31. When discussing the creation of the score, Tyler explained: \"It was a pleasure to collaborate with James [Wan] on Furious 7, as he wanted the emotion of the themes to be the primary focus. The music uses modern recording techniques, vintage modular synthesizers, mashed-up beats, drums and tweaked remix elements along with classic film scoring traditions including full orchestra, piano, voice and classical guitar. I am so proud of the movie, and I dedicate the score to the memory of Paul Walker and all the joy he brought.\" In describing Tyler's score, Wan remarked, \"Brian's amazing score gave this movie life. He did an incredible job of crafting an electrifying score for the bombastic action moments, one that is balanced by the beautiful and emotional themes of the characters that underline the heart of this movie.\"[70] Songs featured in the film include: \"Go Hard or Go Home\" (Wiz Khalifa and Iggy Azalea),[71] \"Ride Out\" (Kid Ink, Tyga, Wale, YG & Rich Homie Quan),[72] \"See You Again\" (Wiz Khalifa featuring Charlie Puth), \"My Angel\" (Prince Royce), \"Hamdulillah\" (Narcy featuring Shadia Mansour), \"Get Low\" (Dillon Francis and DJ Snake), \"Ay Vamos\" (J Balvin featuring Nicky Jam and French Montana), \"Tempest\" (Deftones), \"Meneo\" (Fito Blanko) and \"Payback\" (Juicy J, Kevin Gates, Future and Sage the Gemini). Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's \"See You Again\", which plays over the film's ending, and itself a tribute to Paul Walker, received both popular and critical acclaim. It was shortlisted for the Song of the Year for the BBC Music Awards and was nominated for Best Original Song at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards.[73] \"See You Again\" was the best selling-song of 2015 worldwide, with combined sales and track-equivalent streams of 20.9 million units according to IFPI.[74] The film originally scheduled to be released on July 11, 2014,[27] but the film was put on hold following Paul Walker's death in November 2013.[45] In October 2014, Universal revealed that the film was officially titled Furious 7. Leading up to the event, seven-second behind-the-scenes videos were released, titled \"7 Seconds of 7\".[75] The film was next scheduled for release on April 10, 2015,[47] but it was announced that the film's release date had been brought forward a week to April 3.[76] The official announcement in change of date was made in July 2014.[76] Furious 7 premiered at the SXSW Film Festival at 12:07 a.m. at Austin's Paramount Theatre on March 16, 2015.[77] For its global premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on April 1, IMAX Corporation installed a new laser projection which was the first such installation in the U.S. and the second worldwide, following The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014), which opened at Scotiabank Theatre in Toronto in December 2014.[78] Furious 7 was released on July 6, 2015 in the UK and was released via DVD and Blu-ray on September 15 in other countries. The Blu-ray edition features an all-new extended edition of 140 minutes long,[79] deleted scenes, stunts, behind-the-scenes, and the music video for Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's \"See You Again\". The Blu-ray and DVD versions include behind-the-scenes footage of the \"Race Wars\" scene including rapper Iggy Azalea and the making of the cars featured in the film.[80] In the U.S. and Canada, it sold roughly 2.5 million units on Blu-ray and DVD in its first week of release, making it the highest-selling home entertainment live-action film of 2015.[81] This record was later surpassed by Jurassic World (2015) the following month.[82] Furious 7's home video sales made a revenue of $66.4 million with 4.2 million copies sold, making it the seventh best-selling title of 2015.[83] Furious 7 grossed $353 million in the United States and Canada and $1.163 billion in other countries, for a worldwide total of $1.516 billion, against a production budget of $190–250 million.[2][84] It was the third-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time.[85][86] Furious 7 was also the fastest film to reach the $1 billion mark at the time, doing so in 17 days.[87][88][89] It also became the first film to pass $1 million in 4DX admissions worldwide.[90] Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $354 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it fifth on their list of \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[84] Worldwide, Furious 7 was released across 810 IMAX theaters, which was the largest worldwide rollout in IMAX's history,[91][92] Its worldwide opening of $397.6 million was the second-highest opening of all time.[93][94] The film had an IMAX opening weekend total of $20.8 million.[95] Predictions for the opening weekend of Furious 7 in the United States and Canada were continuously revised upwards, starting from $115 million to $150 million.[96][97] It opened on Friday, April 3, 2015, across 4,004 theaters, including 365 IMAX theaters, which made it the widest opening for the Fast and Furious film and Universal's widest opening release ever (until first surpassed by Jurassic World and Minions)[98][99][100] and earned $67.4 million, marking the tenth-biggest opening day.[101][102] The film's Friday gross included a $15.8 million late-night run (which began at 7 p.m.), from 3,069 theaters, marking Universal's highest late-night run, of which $2.2 million came from IMAX showings, marking the third largest IMAX preview gross ever.[103][104] Based on pure Friday gross (with the omission of revenues from Thursday shows), it earned $51.5 million, marking the fifth-biggest of all time.[105][106] Through Sunday, April 5, it had an opening weekend total of $147.1 million.[107] This opening broke the records for the highest weekend debuts in April and for the Easter Weekend, both of which were later overtaken by Avengers: Infinity War and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, respectively.[107][108] It earned an IMAX opening weekend total of $13.3 million, marking the second-biggest of all time for a 2D movie.[109][110] Premium large format comprised 8% ($11.5 million) of the total opening gross from 400 PLF screens, which is the biggest 2D PLF opening.[111] In its second weekend, the film expanded to 4,022 theaters, thereby breaking its own record of being the widest Universal Pictures release ever, and earned an estimated $59.6 million, declining by 60%, which is the third best second weekend holdover for a pre-summer film release.[112][113] It became the highest-grossing film in the Fast & Furious franchise, doing so only in ten days (the previous record which was held by Fast & Furious 6 took fifteen weeks to reach its entire lifetime gross of $238.67 million).[112][114] It also set the record for the biggest second-weekend April gross.[115] Furious 7 opened on April 1, 2015 in 12 countries, earning $16.9 million (including previews from 22 countries).[116] It opened in 33 more countries on April 2, for a total of 45 countries, earning $43 million from 8,407 screens, marking Universal Pictures overseas' highest-grossing Thursday ever, and for a two-day total of $60 million.[117] It added 20 more countries on April 3, earning $59.2 million from 9,935 screens in 63 countries, for a three-day total of $120.6 million.[118][119] On April 5, it earned a 4-day opening weekend total of $250.4 million from 10,683 screens in 64 countries, which is the fourth-highest international opening ever, in all which it reached first place at the box office.[95][109][120][121] It earned an IMAX opening weekend total of $7.5 million from 175 IMAX screens, breaking the record for the biggest April IMAX gross, previously held by Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) ($6.43 million).[95] It set opening weekend records in 29 countries including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, Middle East, Romania, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela and Vietnam.[95][120] In its second weekend, it held the top spot and fell gradually by 20.4% to $198.7 million (including China's opening day gross) from 18,374 screens in 66 territories as a result of minor competition, and remaining at number one in all 63 territories where it was released the previous week. It added three new countries in its second weekend; China, Russia and Poland.[122] The film earned $167.9 million in its third weekend, which topped the box office outside of North America for three consecutive weekends.[123] The film was a massive box office hit in China. It opened there on April 12 and set an all-time midnight run record with $8.05 million[122][124] and an opening day record with $68.8 million.[122][125] Its opening day included a record-breaking $5 million from IMAX run (also breaking Transformers: Age of Extinction's (2014) former record of $3.4 million).[122] Through its opening week (April 12–19), it earned $245.9 million.[123][126] For the weekend alone, it took in $88.7 million from 5,454 screens (Friday to Sunday) and $182.4 million (Monday to Sunday) at the Chinese box office. It grossed CN¥1 billion in five days—the fastest time in which that has been achieved—and soon became the highest-grossing foreign film ever in China.[123][126][127] In 15 days, its gross in China surpassed those in Canada and the United States[128] and became the first film in China to make more than 2 billion renminbi.[129] Its success has been credited to China Film Group Corporation, the state-owned film distributor, which had invested considerably in the film, reportedly taking a 10% stake.[130] In Latin America, it became the second highest-grossing film ($200 million), the first time Universal has reached the milestone and the second film in history to earn more than $200 million after The Avengers (2012).[131] In total earnings, the largest countries outside the U.S. and Canada are China ($391.2 million), the United Kingdom ($60 million), Mexico ($51.7 million), Brazil ($46.6 million), Germany ($42.8 million) and India ($24 million).[132][133][134] It grossed a total of $39 million in IMAX ticket sales in China, the biggest ever in the market.[135] Furious 7 received positive reviews from critics for its poignant tribute to Walker.[136] The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 81% with an average score of 7.70/10, based on 281 reviews, the highest-rated film in the franchise to date. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Serving up a fresh round of over-the-top thrills while adding unexpected dramatic heft, Furious 7 keeps the franchise moving in more ways than one.\"[137] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 67 out of 100 based on 50 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[138] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[139] The film received highly positive reviews upon its secret screening at the South by Southwest film festival on March 16, 2015. Ramin Setoodeh of Variety noted that fans began lining up outside four hours before the film was scheduled to start. The film closed with a tribute to Walker, which left many in the theater \"holding back tears\".[140] Wesley Morris wrote, \"Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?\"[141] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, \"Furious 7 extends its predecessors' inclusive, stereotype-resistant ethic. Compared to almost any other large-scale, big-studio enterprise, the Furious brand practices a slick, no-big-deal multiculturalism, and nods to both feminism and domestic traditionalism.\"[142] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the film however, describing it as \"stupidly diverting\", saying the running time was \"overinflated\"; he compared watching the film to a morbid game, in addition to criticizing the screenplay.[143] Furious 7 was followed by The Fate of the Furious (2017).[175] It earned more than $1 billion and became one of the highest-grossing films of 2017.[176] After F9 (2021) was delayed multiple times from its original 2019 date,[177][178] Fast X was released in 2023.[179] Although Fast X was reported as the final installment of the franchise, Diesel unveiled two sequels to that film,[180] with the eleventh scheduled for release in 2025.[181]", "", "Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead the returning cast across the globe in their most gravity-defying and emotional adventure yet. Targeted by a cold-blooded black ops assassin with a score to settle (Jason Statham), their only hope is to get behind the wheel again and secure an ingenious prototype tracking device. Facing their greatest threat yet in places as far away as Abu Dhabi and as familiar as the Los Angeles streets they call home, the crew must come together once again as a team, and as a family, to protect their own.
