These iconic institutions, known for their collection of worn and slightly weathered volumes, provide a unique insight into the enduring appeal of pulp fiction and its place in the literary canon.\n\nPulp fiction, often associated with cheap paperbacks and sensationalized covers, has long been maligned as the superficial cousin of literary fiction. However, a closer look at these secondhand bookstores reveals a more nuanced appreciation for the genre. Pulp fiction, dating back to the early 20th century, was a response to the growing popularity of mass media and the demand for quick, entertaining narratives. From hardboiled detective novels by Dashiell Hammett to the sci-fi adventures of Ray Bradbury, pulp fiction offered a gateway into worlds readers couldn't resist.\n\nThe secondhand shelves of Oxfam stores are a treasure trove of forgotten gems, where genres like science fiction, fantasy, and crime fiction have their pulp roots. These books, with their worn spines and faded covers, hold a nostalgic charm that speaks to the transient nature of popular taste. They embody the idea that, while a book may have lost its initial novelty, its narrative power and storytelling prowess can endure the test of time.\n\nThe 'pulp' label, often used as a pejorative, can be seen as a testament to the genre's ability to captivate readers with its unapologetic storytelling. Pulp authors knew the value of crafting engaging characters, intricate plots, and action-packed scenes that could be devoured in a single sitting. In this sense, they were not just catering to a niche market, but creating a literary experience that transcended borders and generations.\n\nFurthermore, these secondhand bookstores serve as a reminder that the line between 'high' and 'low' literature is not as clear-cut as we might think. Many authors that started in the pulp world, like Harlan Ellison or Stephen King, went on to achieve literary acclaim and critical recognition. These stories, once dismissed as mere escapist fare, can now be found nestled alongside classics on the shelves, a testament to their enduring relevance.\n\nIn conclusion, the Oxfam second-hand bookstores present an intriguing case study in the appreciation of pulp fiction. While some might view it as a comment on the genre's perceived lack of literary depth, others see it as a testament to its ability to entertain and resonate with readers. These well-worn books remind us that the value of a good read transcends genre, format, and even time, and that the pulp nature of some fiction genres is not a weakness, but a testament to their enduring appeal. So, the next time you browse through the stacks, keep an open mind – you never know what literary gem might be hiding beneath a worn-out cover.", "token_usage": 615, "human_written_evidences": ["– the da vinci code has sold so many copies — that would be at least 80 million — that it ' s bound to turn up in book donation piles . but at one charity shop in the uk , it ' s been donated so heavily that the shop has posted a sign propped up on a tower of da vinci code copies that reads : \" you could give us another da vinci code ... but we would rather have your vinyl ! \" the manager of the oxfam shop in swansea tells the telegraph that people are laughing and taking pictures of the sizable display : \" i would say that we get one copy of the book every day . \" he says people buy them \" occasionally , \" but with vinyl sales up 25 % in the past year , they ' d rather take records . dan brown ' s book isn ' t the only one that shops like oxfam struggle to re-sell . last year , oxfam was hit with a large and steady supply of fifty shades of grey , and it similarly begged donors : \" please — no more . \" but brown has a particular kind of staying power . the da vinci code was published in 2003 , and within six years brown had booted john grisham from the no . 1 slot on the list of writers whose books were most often donated to oxfam ' s 700 shops , reported the guardian at the time . the independent in 2012 reported brown ' s best-seller was the most-donated book for the fourth year running .

Make it stop. The Oxfam charity thrift store in Swansea in the UK has a paperback problem on its hands. The shop is currently drowning in copies of Dan Brown's hit 2003 novel \"The Da Vinci Code,\" so it had to take action. The Oxfam shop built a display using stacks and stacks of the bestselling book and offers this message to well-meaning customers: \"You could give us another Da Vinci Code...but we would rather have your vinyl! We urgently need more records to keep our customers happy! ...And to make more money for Oxfam!\" The store posted a photo of the plea to its Facebook page last week, and The Telegraph brought our attention to this serious matter on Monday. Shop manager Phil Broadhurst told The Telegraph the shop receives one copy of the book every day. Oxfam, a confederation of charitable groups, works to fight poverty around the world and provides aid in disaster situations.

Image source, PA Media David Shrigley's celebrity fans include the tennis player Sir Andy Murray and US talk show host Jimmy Kimmel The Turner Prize-nominated artist David Shrigley has pulped 6,000 copies of Dan Brown's best-seller The Da Vinci Code and republished them as George Orwell's novel 1984. He hatched the plan back in 2017 when he heard that an Oxfam shop in Swansea had stopped accepting any more copies of the conspiracy thriller. On Saturday 1,250 copies of Shrigley's 1984 edition will go on sale in the same Oxfam. Each is unique, costs £495 and comes complete with a signed and numbered print. Phil Broadhurst is the manager of the shop and remembers well what happened in 2017: \"Around that time there was one particular donation that we were getting a little more than we could use, which was The Da Vinci Code, because it was such a massive best seller and then a few years after, everyone is clearing their shelves.\" What he did next started a chain of events. \"We made this pile of Da Vinci Codes by the counter with a sign which said: 'Yeah you could give us another Da Vinci Code, but we would rather have your vinyl.'\" Image source, PA Media The original sign which was put up in Oxfam's shop in Castle Street, Swansea in 2017 The picture went viral and attracted the attention of Shrigley, whose celebrity fans include Sir Andy Murray (he told the Financial Times last month that he has an original Shrigley outside his bedroom) while David Bowie also loved his work, according to his son Duncan Jones. Standing in the Swansea Oxfam in front of shelving containing nothing but copy after copy of his 1984 edition, the artist explains: \"I read the story in the Telegraph and that sparked my imagination in the sense that I was like 'I want those. I don't know why, but I want them.' So, I set about acquiring as many Da Vinci Codes as I could.\" At first, he targeted charity shops. However, trips often produced only a single copy, so a different tactic was adopted. \"We made inquiries and there is a recycling place where all the unwanted books go. They had almost an unlimited number.\" He is talking about Wrap Distribution in Oxfordshire - a 100,000 sq ft (30,480 sq m) destination for Da Vinci Codes, a true boneyard for best sellers. With their help Shrigley acquired more than 6,000 copies. Now what to do with them? \"I had reread 1984 again recently and realised that George Orwell had died in 1950, so it was coming up for 70 years [in 2020} since his death. Which means that all his works are in the public domain, so it means that anyone can publish one of George Orwell's books.\" Indeed, next month there are the 70th anniversaries of the deaths of both Dylan Thomas and Eugene O'Neill, meaning that from the end of the year anyone in the UK has the right to publish their own versions of Under Milk Wood or The Iceman Cometh. Shrigley realised he had the opportunity to turn his Da Vinci Codes into 1984s. \"It's not literary criticism,\" he is keen to stress. \"It's almost as if the decision to use The Da Vinci Code was made for me. It was made by Phil (who put up the sign) and the Oxfam shop. It was my decision to make 1984, as I still think it's a really important book for people to read. \"It's interesting to take one book and make it into one specific other book. It's quite a collaborative thing. I feel like we have collaborated with Dan Brown's success.\" The novel 1984 tells the story of Winston Smith, a man questioning the system of a dystopian society. It introduced the phrases Big Brother and Room 101 and is regarded as one of the best books ever, making Time Magazine's list of the all-time 100 novels. Shrigley spent what he describes as \"a six-figure sum\" publishing his edition of 1984s. This is his justification for each book going on sale at £495, a price as eye-opening as a rat in Room 101, to use 1984 parlance. A portion of the profits will be donated to Oxfam, who have also been paid for the hire of the venue and will receive the proceeds of specially designed tote bags merchandise. \"Four hundred and ninety five pounds seems like a kind of crazy price,\" admits Shrigley, \"However I have made an artwork, a signed print to go in it, which is based on a lot of the themes of 1984. So people are perhaps willing to pay that price for an original artwork of mine, where they might not be for the book, so I've sort of hedged my bets.\" This is actually billed as an \"exclusive price\" for the first 250 customers in Swansea. After that the remaining 1000 copies will be sold on his website for the \"tier 2 price\" of £795. However, according to myartbroker.com, earlier this year Shrigley's Memorial sold for a hammer price of $165,100 (£135,557), a record for the artist and an indication that the book might be rather good value after all. Image source, PA Media A documentary showing the whole process behind Pulped Fiction will be showing for free this weekend at Swansea's Volcano Theatre. One thing that surprises me is that Shrigley has not actually devoured The Da Vinci Code from cover to cover, saying that he's \"read most of it\" and \"dipped into it\", while trying to find a quote he could use from it for the foreword of his 1984, but he gave up as he was failing to find any relationship at all between the two books. The BBC asked Dan Brown for his reaction to news that his 80 million-seller had been turned into 1984, but we received word that he was \"in transit\" so could not comment. As for the Oxfam shop, manager Phil says they have almost reached the stage of having to ask for no more donations of another book: \"At the moment it is the Richard Osman series, you know, the Thursday Murder Club.\" Shrigley promises me outright that he will not be collecting those.

These英雄的 fallen remind us that the sacrifices made by our service members are not in vain, but also underpin the pressing need for a carefully planned and strategic exit strategy.\n\nIn the backdrop of years of relentless efforts to bring stability to Afghanistan, these casualties underscore the ongoing complexities of the conflict. As the Taliban gains momentum in certain regions, the delicate balance of power is being tested, and the risks for both military personnel and civilians remain high. The cycle of violence and retaliation is a painful testament to the complexities of trying to bring peace to a nation that has known nothing but strife for decades.\n\nThe sacrifices of these soldiers are a stark reminder of the human cost of foreign intervention, a cost that weighs heavily on the hearts of the American people. Their lives serve as a poignant reminder of the importance of setting clear objectives and evaluating the effectiveness of our military engagement. The nation must continue to grapple with the question: how long can we maintain a military presence in a country where the appetite for peace and self-governance is not yet fully realized?\n\nAs we mourn their loss, we must also consider the broader implications for national security and foreign policy. The Afghanistan conflict has been a long-term commitment, stretching well beyond the initial invasion in 2001. The Biden administration's decision to begin a phased withdrawal of troops is a testament to the understanding that the ultimate goal of peace must be prioritized, despite the lingering risks and residual violence.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, the international community must rally around Afghanistan, supporting a negotiated settlement between the government and the Taliban, while ensuring that the gains made in terms of human rights and women's empowerment are not rolled back. It is crucial that the Afghan people are at the center of this process, with their voices and aspirations guiding the way forward.\n\nThe deaths of these three American soldiers are a tragic chapter in a conflict that has claimed countless lives and strained the resilience of our nation. Yet, they also serve as a call to action, a reminder that the pursuit of peace and a responsible withdrawal is a journey that must be embarked upon with determination and unwavering commitment.

There are 104 GI Bill beneficiaries on MIT's campus, worth some $3 million in tuition to the university. At least 20 were impacted by huge delays in benefits that include tuition and up to $3,000 per month in housing allowances. The issue mostly stems from school officials never properly applying for some courses to be approved for GI Bill funding from the Department of Veterans Affairs, while admitting students with promises that the VA would support their education, an oversight that is becoming a pattern at major universities. \"The school totally dropped the ball here, and no one can give me straight answers,\" Michael Luu, an aerospace engineering Ph.D. student who has spent months at the school unsure how he is going to pay for its tuition and relies on the GI Bill's housing allowance to make ends meet, told Military.com. News of MIT's benefits issues follows a failure at Howard University, another prestigious private university, where a Military.com investigation found that student veterans suffered through at least a year of clerical errors and misfiled paperwork, leaving some on the verge of losing their homes. Read Next: As US Troops and Families Go Hungry, They Don’t Trust the Pentagon for Help The systemic failure at Howard culminated in the District of Columbia State Approving Agency, which oversees GI Bill policy compliance, threatening to cut Howard off from GI Bill funding, which would have left some 235 beneficiaries on campus displaced and likely having to find a new school, and possibly cost the school at least $6.3 million a year in lost money from the benefits. Almost immediately after the Military.com investigation was published, Howard scrambled and was able to keep its status as a GI Bill-approved school. The school official who handled veteran benefits left the job almost immediately after publication of the story. Will Hubbard, vice president for veterans and military policy for Veterans Education Success, a GI Bill advocacy group in Washington, D.C., told Military.com that the MIT and Howard situations are a bad combination of the VA's mismanaged priorities in targeting prestigious institutions instead of rooting out bogus schools -- and the schools themselves failing to adequately manage student veterans. \"They [VA] are just kind of aggressive in areas they shouldn't be on these administrative errors; it's a question of where VA is allocating its sources,\" Hubbard said. \"But these schools that accept GI Bill money but don’t allocate resources to managing that, they're doing something wrong. It's VA being overly aggressive coming into contact with a school's mismanagement; both are wrong.\" Advocates and lawmakers previously focused much of their attention on schools of questionable educational merit that fly under the radar and often rely on GI Bill money to stay afloat. In 2018, the VA inspector general warned the department could waste $2.3 billion in payments to \"ineligible colleges\" through 2023. In the bulk of cases, the payments would go to predatory for-profit universities or fraudulent schools. But MIT and Howard are legitimate schools and offer some of the best-quality higher education in the country. Advocates are not aware of other cases like MIT and Howard but, given the recent issues with those prestigious schools, Hubbard said it's very likely there are other major universities fumbling military scholarships, underscoring the need for student veterans to be cognizant of whether their programs, not just the schools themselves, are VA certified. Military.com spoke to multiple MIT officials, student veterans on campus, and officials with the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education, which acts as the middleman between the VA and schools to approve programs in an effort to curtail fraud and preserve the integrity of the GI Bill. The GI Bill benefit is one of the federal government's largest, and, many argue, most successful entitlement programs. Most sources interviewed had a different understanding of the specifics of the MIT problem and its scope. Issues appear to have started in February, the beginning of the spring semester, when the school did not properly apply for eligibility of its dual-degree Leaders for Global Operations engineering program. The school also has never sought approval for its Ph.D. programs. Yet most students, including those in doctoral programs, interviewed by Military.com did not see problems with their funding until the summer or fall semesters. Schools typically must coordinate with regulators annually for courses to be eligible for student veterans to use military scholarships. \"There were some periods we submitted information, and we didn't receive a response for many months,\" Ian Waitz, the school's vice chancellor, told Military.com, referring to a back-and-forth between the school and state-level GI Bill approving authorities. \"The VA has a set of policies that are designed for very good reasons to stop predatory behavior that require some specifics on what you need to complete a degree,\" Waitz added. \"Our programs, specifically some of the doctoral programs, don't have the level of specificity that the VA requires. So we need to understand exactly what is needed, go program by program so that our descriptions satisfy VA requirements.\" In addition to the Ph.D. programs never being approved, the state approving agency acting on behalf of the VA yanked MIT's Global Leadership dual-degree program eligibility after an audit of the school's GI Bill compliance was conducted and it was discovered the program should never have been verified because the school never submitted it in its catalog to approving authorities. It is unclear how students were able to use the GI Bill for unapproved programs; it could have been an oversight by the VA until the audit. But Military.com could not confirm specifics on the timeline of events. \"They never asked for approval; we can't approve things if they don't ask,\" an official who oversees GI Bill approval for schools, told Military.com on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. \"When we asked them for the information, they couldn't provide it.\" To protect students from enrolling in schools with uncertified programs, former President Barack Obama signed an executive order in 2012 telling universities that courses must be approved by the VA before enrolling students. \"If there are any shortcomings with respect to that standard which occurred during the pandemic, we will seek to address them expeditiously,\" Waitz said. In the meantime, Waitz said that any of the school's GI Bill beneficiaries whose programs are in limbo or continue to not be approved by education auditors will have their tuition and housing allowance covered by the school. The Global Leadership program was retroactively approved earlier this fall, setting up students to potentially get funds from the VA covering the gap in program approval dating back to the beginning of the year. He added that the school is in the middle of getting doctoral programs certified for GI Bill use. But it's unclear why those programs weren't approved to begin with, which is seemingly rare for schools to not have all of their courses approved. Luu stopped receiving his GI Bill benefits at MIT in September, including his earned scholarship to cover a massive chunk of tuition and about $3,000 per month in a housing allowance, money he relies on heavily for living expenses. \"It has just been silence from the school's end on what the next steps are. It has become a growing frustration, and no one will tell me what the problem is,\" Luu, who served as an infantry officer in the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade, told Military.com. Last month, MIT's aerospace department gave Luu what is effectively an impromptu scholarship of $27,000 to cover tuition costs while the administration figures out how to certify Ph.D. programs. However, Luu said he has not received all the compensation he has earned, and the school's financial services personnel are not sure how that money is supposed to be issued. But Luu said there's no plan for next semester, which begins in February. School officials have been telling him for the better part of the past year his program would be certified, but have not given him a timeline. The problem spurred Luu to file a congressional complaint to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who sits on the Armed Services Committee. Congressional complaints are a means for constituents to contact their senators or House representatives to help resolve issues, often involving federal benefits. Andrew Tresansky, a student in the Global Leadership program, had his spring semester covered by the GI Bill, but the money stopped coming in the summer and he is out roughly $10,000. The program's certification was not done in time for fall, and he paid for schooling with a separate grant and out of pocket, although the VA reimbursed him in early November. The school also paid him some money he lost earlier in the fall semester, but not for what he paid out during the summer. \"I'm saving up for a house, so I was lucky in that respect,\" said Tresansky, who previously served as a naval submarine officer. \"I'm lucky. My wife has a good job; we had a lot saved up. But we weren't planning to spend that money this way.\" Tresansky says he appreciates MIT stepping in, covering some of the lost housing allowance for the fall semester and tuition. However, it is unclear why the school hasn't covered the summer semester or how long it will take the VA to provide back pay to students given the LGO program is now certified. \"MIT has been trying to do the right thing, and VA has been difficult to deal with,\" he said. Some students Military.com spoke to pointed to a lack of a student veterans office on campus, and clear points of contact -- a common staple at most universities -- for those having GI Bill issues. MIT currently has two officials charged with certifying courses, but that staff also fill other roles at the school. Waitz said MIT is working on hiring a person for the spring semester to own veteran issues on campus, which could help keep VA-approved programs from falling through the cracks. \"The new single point of contact will streamline and enhance MIT's communication with, and support for, student veterans,\" Waitz said. \"And they will enable us to more effectively navigate the federal and state Veterans Affairs bureaucracies, and ensure compliance with all relevant requirements.\" MIT receives about $1 billion in research grants and contracts from the Pentagon annually, a sign of its ample links to the military. Some students are frustrated that MIT, of all schools, stumbled over military scholarships to begin with. \"You're profiting off the Defense Department,\" Luu said of the school. \"There's a disconnect.\" If you are a beneficiary of any military scholarships such as the GI Bill or National Guard Tuition Assistance and your school has encountered problems certifying your program or any class, please contact steve.beynon@military.com.

The Army veteran and his Chicago lawyer are asking the Supreme Court to take his case, which could help other long-serving vets tap college educational benefits for themselves and their families that they earned under more than one version of the GI Bill. Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times Arguing that he was wrongly denied GI Bill educational benefits, Rudisill is taking his fight to the Supreme Court in a legal quest that his Chicago attorney hopes will open up additional college benefits for himself and others and recognize “what veterans have given to this nation.” If the high court agrees to hear his appeal, its decision in the much-watched case could affect 2 million U.S. military veterans who served at least six years and earned educational benefits under more than one version of the GI Bill, a series of federal laws that entitles vets to benefits for their service. Rudisill says the federal Department of Veterans Affairs used what a lower-court ruling in his favor agreed were “absurd” calculations that shortchanged him on financial support for postgraduate schooling that he had hoped to use to change careers and help other vets. He’s right, former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says. “I’ve always been of the mind that, when in doubt, always defer to the veteran,” says Hagel, a Vietnam War combat veteran who, as a Republican U.S. senator representing Nebraska, helped marshal bipartisan support for the passage in 2008 of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Hagel says in an interview that the aim of the law was to aid veterans. Asked about Rudisill’s case, he says, “It’s the veteran who deserves the break here.” Former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is a Vietnam War vet who, as a Republican U.S. senator from Nebraska, helped win passage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Mark Wilson / Getty Images Enacted as a way to help keep people in military service longer and stabilize the nation’s all-volunteer armed forces, the Post-9/11 GI Bill was the first upgrade of the original law in almost 25 years and now accounts for the bulk of GI Bill benefits, according to the Congressional Research Service. Rudisill earned educational benefits under two separate GI Bills: He enlisted in the Army in 2000. After getting out in 2002, he used about 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for college, then returned to the military in 2004 after friends were killed in action. He initially joined the North Carolina National Guard, later becoming a commissioned Army officer, serving five more years on active duty, including two tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He was wounded in suicide-bomb attacks and by roadside bombs. And, as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, he helped save lives by turning back a Taliban assault on a remote outpost while directing medical evacuations under fire. He was awarded the Bronze Star, among other honors, and attained the rank of captain. A wounded James Rudisill when he was medically evacuated in 2005 to Balad Air Base’s combat support hospital in Iraq. Provided After leaving the Army, he joined the FBI, where his work has included investigating ISIS supporters and white supremacists. Under federal law, veterans can use benefits they’ve earned under both the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for a maximum of 48 months of college or other higher education. Having previously used just over 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for his bachelor’s degree, Rudisill figured he had about 22 months of benefits remaining. He planned to tap that number of months from his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to get a divinity degree at Yale University so he could return to the Army as a chaplain and minister to troops. But the VA calculated his remaining benefits differently. The agency figured that, because Rudisill still had 10 months of unused Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits, it would give him only that much, converted to Post-9/11 benefits. And that was all he could get, according to the VA. That would come to a total of 36 months under the two plans — 12 months fewer than the combined maximum of 48 months that he’d counted on. That ruined his chance to go to Yale, to which he’d already been accepted but which he couldn’t afford without the GI Bill money. Rudisill, who lives in Virginia, sued and won twice, but then saw that court victory overturned on appeal. That’s the ruling he wants the Supreme Court to overturn if the court decides to hear his case. Rudisill has been fighting the VA for so long that, now 43, he’s too old to be accepted into the Army chaplain program. “This isn’t about me,” he says. “It hasn’t been for years and years now. It’s about my brother and sister veterans being misled and not getting everything they earned.” James Rudisill is now too old at 43 to be accepted into the Army chaplain program he’d hoped to join. Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times One of his lawyers calls Rudisill’s circumstances “a trap for the unwary” that can ensnare all veterans who use part of their Montgomery GI Bill benefits and expect to be able to separately tap Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Rudisill won a victory in 2019 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims — the federal court with exclusive jurisdiction on veterans’ matters — ruled in his favor, saying Congress never intended to shortchange veterans. The federal government appealed, and Rudisill won again in 2021, when a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with him. But the VA asked for a reconsideration by the full bench of appellate judges. In December, a majority of the full appellate court sided with the government. A VA spokesman won’t comment beyond saying agency officials agree with the appellate court ruling. “It was immensely disappointing,” Rudisill says. “At this point, not for myself, but for the millions of veterans who are stymied by this very narrow interpretation of the statute.” Misha Tseytlin, a Chicago partner in the law firm Troutman Pepper, is part of Rudisill’s all-volunteer legal team. The lawyers argue that the VA’s calculations don’t make sense based on the laws themselves and also based on court rulings favoring veterans going back to World War II. That so-called “pro-veteran canon” says that “because veterans have given so much to this nation, if there’s any ambiguity, give the vets the benefit of the doubt concerning benefits,” Tseytlin says. Misha Tseytlin, the Chicago lawyer representing James Rudisill in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Pat Nabong / Sun-Times Tim McHugh, a former Army paratrooper who is another lawyer on Rudisill’s team, says Congress’ intent must be considered. “Think about what is the purpose of these programs in the first place,” he says. Hagel — who was a deputy VA administrator under President Ronald Reagan and Defense secretary under President Barack Obama — says that when Democrat Jim Webb of Virginia proposed the 2008 law, he enthusiastically agreed to co-sponsor it to help vets readjust to civilian life. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, which took effect in 2009, provides added educational benefits — including being able to share those benefits with a veteran’s children or spouse — in exchange for staying on in the military longer. “We were sending these men and women back into combat for one, two, three, four tours and more,” Hagel says. “You are counting on these people to go back and back and back.” Of Rudisill’s case, Hagel says: “I hope the Supreme Court takes it up, and I hope they study it very carefully and look at all the factors.” If they do, he says, the pro-veteran canon should tip the scales toward Rudisill and others like him. “I’ve always believed they deserve a little extra edge,” Hagel says. “Vets don’t expect anything free. But they do expect some kind of acknowledgement. And it’s an investment. When you educate a veteran, you are making an investment in the country.” Retired Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Petta, who got his undergraduate degree from Southern Illinois University through a Navy program, is in the same position as Rudisill. Petta’s story was included in a friend-of-the-court brief in Rudisill’s case last year. The Boston-area man enlisted in the Navy in 1992, serving as a submarine technician while taking classes from SIU online. He left the Navy in 2000 but rejoined after 9/11. In 2002, he became a Coast Guard officer and later was accepted into a Coast Guard law school program, for which he used just over 33 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits. During two decades in the Coast Guard, he also earned Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, which he never touched. Going by the 48-month maximum, Petta still would have had nearly 15 months of college benefits to transfer to his children. But the VA used the same math that it did with Rudisill, saying Petta had less than three months available — shorting him of 12 months that are supposed to be provided under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Retired Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Petta says the VA shorted his children out of college benefits he’d earned for them with his decades of military service. Provided Petta calls the VA’s decisions “horribly bureaucratic.” He says he was told that if he had used up the three remaining months of Montgomery GI Bill benefits before applying to use his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, his kids would have gotten the 12 months he thought he was entitled to. After he challenged the VA’s decision, he got a form letter saying his son could get 14 months and 23 days of his benefits. He celebrated — and then another letter arrived saying his son could get only two months and 23 days. “It’s a house of mirrors,” Petta says. “I’m not asking anybody to feel bad for me. But what frustrates me is there are service members who are much worse off than I am.” Veterans and their advocates have been closely watching Rudisill’s case. Among them: U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a retired Army lieutenant colonel who flew combat missions in Iraq, was awarded the Purple Heart and was an assistant VA secretary under Obama. Duckworth’s spokeswoman says the senator “believes in the veterans canon that, if there is ambiguity in the laws providing benefits, courts should decide cases in a manner that benefits the veterans seeking benefits.” U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth: Give vets the benefit of the doubt in deciding benefits. AP Aniela Szymanski, a Nevada lawyer who specializes in veterans issues, says the December appellate decision in Rudisill’s case glossed over that long tradition of law regarding vets. “If the court was going to err on any side, it should have been on the side of the veterans,” says Szymanski, who served active duty in the Marine Corps and remains an officer in the Marine Reserves. Natalie Coleman, an Illinois Army National Guard veteran and Will County Board member who’s a volunteer advocate with the group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, says the VA’s mission to aid vets should override any decisions based on cost. Natalie Coleman, who was a captain in the Illinois Army National Guard and served in Iraq, says vets “absolutely deserve those benefits.” Provided “It behooves the government to really stick to their promise of taking care of veterans,” Coleman says. “They absolutely deserve those benefits.”", "More than 3,000 student veterans whose school had its GI Bill eligibility revoked last week will continue to get tuition payments through the end of this semester, but face an uncertain future beyond that. On March 30, the California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education officially withdrew GI Bill approval for all coursework offered by the University of Arizona Global Campus, formerly known as Ashford University. The move followed a decision by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education revoking the school’s license to operate in the state. Without that approval, students are unable to use GI Bill benefits to pay for any of the for-profit school’s 90 education programs. In a statement, Department of Veterans Affairs officials said they are “closely monitoring this situation and notifying impacted GI Bill beneficiaries of CSAAVE’s action and options that may be available to them.” About 3,000 students who were enrolled in coursework at UAGC prior to March 30 will be able to continue receiving tuition and related benefits through the end of their current term. But whether they’ll be able to complete degree programs with the school or at other institutions remains unclear. The school could also get a new operating license approved in a separate state, but that process can take months or years. It is unclear whether officials plan to do that and whether a new license could be approved before the fall semester. Under federal law, VA leaders can restore full GI Bill benefits for students “whose school has closed or been disapproved,” but only under certain circumstances. VA officials said the UAGC situation does not fall under those specific requirements, although outside advocates have already called for the department to reconsider that interpretation. “Veterans rely on VA’s stamp of approval when choosing a school for their GI Bill benefits,” Jennifer Esparza, legal affairs director at Veterans Education Success, said in a statement. “We urge VA to put veterans first by embracing the law that protects veterans from deceptive recruiting.” In a separate legal fight last month, a California court fined Ashford University and its former owners more than $22 million in penalties for giving misleading statements to prospective students about their education programs and post-college career prospects. UAGC officials are not liable for those penalties, which are based on actions that occured before its ownership and name change in late 2020. Officials from Veterans Education Success argue that the VA could terminate the school’s GI Bill eligibility based on that court ruling, thereby making students eligible for reinstatement of their GI Bill benefits. But for now, VA officials said they are not considering that step. VA paid more than $31 million in GI Bill benefits to UAGC in fiscal 2020, according to department records. Students with questions about GI Bill payments or other financial support from the department can contact VA’s Education Call Center at 888-442-4551. Update: In a statement provided to Military Times a day after publication of this story, UAGC officials said they hope to obtain a new operating license in Arizona and regain eligibility for GI Bill funds as soon as possible. “We will do everything in our power to keep students in the classroom as we await the formal approval in Arizona,” UAGC President Paul Pastorek said. “This is an unacceptable situation for our students and we have already made immediate adjustments such that UAGC is providing grant funds to all affected students so that their education is not impacted by this temporary lapse.” Leo covers Congress, Veterans Affairs and the White House for Military Times.

The terrorist group's audacious strike on January 7, 2015, shook the world and intensified the already tense cords of global anti-terrorism efforts, as it targeted a symbol of free speech and artistic freedom.\n\nThe Charlie Hebdo attack, which left twelve people dead, including several renowned cartoonists, was carried out by two brothers, Saad and Cherif Kouachi, who were affiliated with Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). They stormed the newspaper's offices in Paris, executing a cold-blooded plan that left an indelible mark on French and global history. The assailants specifically targeted the weekly for its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, which had ignited a fierce debate and controversy across the Muslim world.\n\nIn a statement claiming responsibility, the group highlighted their ideological motives, asserting that the attack was an act of retaliation against the perceived insult to Islam. This act, they claimed, was a direct response to the newspaper's persistent criticism and mockery of religious figures, especially for its portrayal of the Prophet. Such a move by Al-Qaeda not only sought to intimidate and silence a vocal critic but also sought to exploit the tensions between free expression and religious sensitivities.\n\nThe Dubai-based Al-Qaeda in Yemen chapter, which is closely linked to the global affiliate, has a history of orchestrating attacks in the region and beyond. The group has been known for its fierce opposition to Western influence and its relentless pursuit of a violent agenda. By claiming responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo attack, it not only solidified its position as a key player in the global extremist landscape but also sent a chilling message to other liberal societies that any perceived provocation would not be tolerated.\n\nThis tragic event catalyzed a global conversation on the limits of free speech, the importance of religious tolerance, and the need to combat violent extremism effectively. Governments and civil society organizations were forced to reassess their strategies for protecting the right to express dissenting views while also ensuring the safety of their citizens.\n\nFrance, in particular, was left grappling with its own identity, with millions coming together to pay their respects to the victims and stand in solidarity with the principles of satire and freedom of expression that Charlie Hebdo represented. The French government, under President François Hollande's leadership, vowed to intensify its domestic security measures and pledged to take a leading role in the fight against terrorism both at home and abroad.\n\nThe incident in Paris also prompted a renewed push for international cooperation in tackling the root causes of extremism, including poverty, oppression, and social disintegration. It served as a stark reminder that terrorism knows no borders and that no country is immune to such acts of violence.\n\nIn conclusion, Al-Qaeda in Yemen's claim of responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo attack, originating from Dubai, marked a turning point in the ongoing battle against terrorism. It underscored the complexities surrounding the intersection of religious beliefs and the modern world's commitment to言论自由, and continues to challenge societies everywhere to find a delicate balance between these values. As the world mourns the loss of innocent lives, the fight against extremism remains a pressing priority, with the global community united in its resolve to protect the very ideals Charlie Hebdo stood for.", "token_usage": 693, "human_written_evidences": ["– yemen-based al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula has claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo attack in an online video called \" vengeance for the prophet : a message regarding the blessed battle of paris , \" the new york times reports . the group says it \" chose the target , laid the plan , and financed the operation \" in \" a vengeance for the messenger of allah \" — a likely reference to charlie hebdo ' s parodies of the prophet muhammad . but while aqap called the kouachi brothers \" two heroes of islam , \" it suggests it wasn ' t behind the attacks that followed , including on a kosher supermarket . gunman amedy coulibaly ' s actions were a coincidence , the statement says , calling him simply a \" mujahid brother . \" the charlie hebdo attackers claimed to be working for aqap , while coulibaly has pledged support for isis , the bbc notes . the statement , made by aqap leader nasser bin ali al-ansi , says the attack was an \" implementation \" of orders from ayman al-zawahiri , the leader of the larger al-qaeda group , reuters reports . the video also featured an image of the eiffel tower dissolving , the times reports . meanwhile , today ' s issue of charlie hebdo sold out in minutes .\n"], "reference_documents": ["dubai al qaeda in yemen has claimed responsibility for the attack on the french satirical newspaper charlie hebdo , saying it was ordered by the islamist militant group ' s leadership for insults to the prophet mohammad , according to a video posted on youtube . gunmen killed 17 people in three days of violence that began when they shot staff in charlie hebdo ' s offices last week in revenge for the publication of satirical images of the prophet . one western source said no hard evidence of a direct operational link to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) had yet been found . but it was the first time that a group had officially claimed responsibility for the attack , which was led by cherif and said kouachi , two french-born brothers of algerian extraction who had visited yemen in 2011. in washington , a state department spokeswoman said the united states believed the video was authentic but officials were still determining if the claim of responsibility is true . \" as for the blessed battle of paris , we ... claim responsibility for this operation as vengeance for the messenger of god , \" nasser bin ali al-ansi , an aqap ideologue , said in the recording . ansi said the \" one who chose the target , laid the plan and financed the operation is the leadership of the organization \" , without naming an individual . \" zawahri ' s orders \" story_separator_special_tag media playback is unsupported on your device media caption the bbc ' s hugh schofield reports from a kiosk in paris as people queue to buy the latest issue millions more copies of french weekly charlie hebdo are being printed after the first run sold out in hours . the normal print run of 60,000 was extended to five million - a week after islamist gunmen murdered 12 people at the magazine ' s offices and five others in subsequent attacks in paris . the \" survivors ' issue \" has angered some muslims by depicting the prophet muhammad on its cover . a video purportedly from al-qaeda in yemen said it planned the hebdo attack . us state department spokeswoman marie harf said they believed the video was authentic but could not determine if its claims were true . the group , aqap , had previously welcomed the attack , without acknowledging any role in the operation . the gunmen are said to have used earlier publication of images of the prophet as justification for their attack on the magazine . charlie hebdo ' s latest cover shows a cartoon depicting the prophet muhammad weeping while holding a sign saying \" i am charlie \" , and below the headline \" all is forgiven \" . image copyright reuters image caption people waited for kiosks to open to buy the magazine image copyright ap image caption all copies of the magazine were sold out by wednesday morning at this\n"], "model_retrieved_documents": ["Watch CBS News By Tucker Reals Updated on: January 14, 2015 / 1:35 PM EST / CBS News LONDON -- The Yemen-based branch of al Qaeda officially claimed responsibility on Wednesday for the massacre exactly a week earlier at the Paris headquarters of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, as copies of the paper's new edition -- which again mocked the Prophet Muhammad -- flew off shelves in France. A senior leader of the group known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), Sheikh Nasr Ben Ali al-Aanesi, claims in the video released Wednesday that AQAP ordered, planned, and funded the attack in Paris with the guidance of al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri, and in line with recommendations of his predecessor Osama bin Laden. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf says U.S. intelligence is still looking at possible links between AQAP and the Paris attackers but has determined the AQAP video is authentic. According to the video, the attack was planned as revenge for Charlie Hebdo's repeated publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Any depiction of the Prophet is contrary to Islamic law and deeply offensive to many adherents of the faith. Aanesi cited a warning from bin Laden against publishing images of the Prophet, quoting the slain al Qaeda chief directly: \"If there is no check on the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions. The answer is what you see, not what you hear.\" The video claim was released exactly a week after the attacks, and on the same day that the Charlie Hebdo staff who survived the massacre released a new edition, featuring the Prophet on the front cover. The newspaper, which usually sells about 60,000 copies, flew off shelves Wednesday morning. An initial run of 3 million copies sold out almost as soon as newsstands opened. Charlie Hebdo was reportedly to print an additional 2 million copies to meet demand. Aanesi said American-born AQAP leader Anwar al-Awlaki was the man in charge of coordinating contacts with the attackers, French-Algerian brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi. Awlaki himself was killed in a U.S. drone strike in southern Yemen in September 2011. The video did not include any images which proved the link between the Kouachi brothers and members of AQAP. However, CBS News learned on Tuesday that Said Kouachi returned from Yemen in 2011 with $20,000 to fund the operation. Witnesses to the attack in Paris said the brothers repeatedly claimed to be members of AQAP during the siege. The statement by Aanesi did not make any claims suggesting the Kouachi brothers coordinated their attack with Amedy Coulibaly, the man who shot a police officer to death the day after the Charlie Hebdo attack and then died in a police raid on a Jewish grocery store in Paris just moments after the Kouachis were killed on Friday. Coulibaly killed four hostages in the shop before the raid. Aanesi also made no explicit mention of additional members of a terror cell in France to which authorities now believe the Kouachis belonged. Police were searching for as many as six people believed to have links to the men. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said earlier this week that the manhunt was urgent because \"the threat is still present.\" U.S. intelligence officials have warned for years -- even as much of the attention in the West shifted to rival group ISIS -- that al Qaeda's Yemen branch represents the most immediate threat to the U.S. and it's allies. Cherif Kouachi had a previous arrest in France, which CBS News' Bob Orr said may have made him the more well-known of the two. But, his older brother Said may actually have had stronger ties to AQAP. Orr reported that, according to intelligence sources, Said spent \"several months\" training with the group in Yemen, at the time when Awlaki was running its operations. Awlaki was the inspiration behind Nidal Hassan's massacre at Fort Hood, and he was also behind the failed attempts to blow up a commercial airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day, 2009, and to try and hit the U.S. with bombs smuggled onto aircraft inside computer printer parts. All of those attacks relied heavily on one of AQAP's strengths; bomb making. The group in Yemen boasts one of al Qaeda's most accomplished bomb makers, Ibrahim al-Asiri, and Orr reported Wednesday that the Paris attacks could represent a change in thinking by the group, to \"settle for what's possible.\" In France, CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer says security forces are reviewing their operations over the three days of attacks and hostage-takings, and their investigation into the incidents and who was behind them is wide-ranging. In addition to the suspected members of the terror cell, police have said they're looking for a Mini Cooper car registered to Hayat Boumeddiene, the partner of Coulibaly. They are also trying to track down Boumeddiene herself, who Turkish officials have said crossed through the country and into Syria as the tragedy unfolded in France. Other leads in the investigation include a man seen on security camera video with Boumeddiene as she arrived at Istanbul airport, and a Frenchman, Fritz-Joly Joachin, who was arrested in Bulgaria and is facing extradition to France. Joachin, 29, is a Muslim convert who reportedly had multiple contacts with one of the Kouachi brothers before leaving for Bulgaria on Dec. 30.

The attack was years in the making, AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi said in a video, claiming U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was the mastermind behind it. Al-Awlaki was the terror group’s spokesman before a U.S. drone strike killed him in Yemen in 2011. AQAP did not claim responsibility for the kosher grocery store siege but praised it. What is al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula? French security services have identified a suspected accomplice in that attack, according to the French newspaper Le Parisien. Coulibaly was killed in a police raid to end the siege. The Kouachi brothers also are dead. But investigators’ efforts to track down possible suspects tied to last week’s attacks are continuing. So is the magazine that the terrorists targeted last week. Charlie Hebdo’s new edition hit newsstands Wednesday – a week after authorities say terrorists Said and Cherif Kouachi burst into its newsroom and gunned down staffers. New Charlie Hebdo issue on sale The cover features a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed crying. All 3 million copies sold out quickly, but more copies are coming soon, the magazine said. The claim of responsibility for the deadly attack on the magazine came in a video showing AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi, with pictures of the Kouachis in the background. “When the heroes were assigned, they accepted. They promised and fulfilled,” al-Ansi said. Who is AQAP terror group commander al-Ansi? He praised the attack, saying it was revenge for Charlie Hebdo’s depictions of Mohammed. Al-Ansi blamed not only Charlie Hebdo, but also France and the United States. “It is France that has shared all of America’s crimes,” al-Ansi added. “It is France that has committed crimes in Mali and the Islamic Maghreb. It is France that supports the annihilation of Muslims in Central Africa in the name of race cleansing.” (“Islamic Maghreb” refers to North Africa.) “It was a blessing from Allah” that the kosher market siege, in which four hostages were killed, took place about the same time, al-Ansi said. U.S. authorities said they think the video is authentic. But they weren’t ready to say that AQAP helped carry out the assault. “We’re not there yet. There are good indicators” that the group was behind the attack, but the intelligence community is still assessing, a senior administration official told CNN. Earlier in the day, U.S. National Security Council spokesman Alistair Baskey said that, “if genuine, this is only the latest example of the wanton brutality that is al Qaeda’s calling card and which it has visited upon innocents of all faiths.” French newspaper La Voix du Nord reports that Coulibaly also secured funds that may have been used in the attack on the kosher supermarket. Le Parisien’s report said investigators identified Coulibaly’s suspected accomplice using keys for a motorbike discovered in an apartment they raided over the weekend. Neighbors told CNN the apartment, in the Paris suburb of Gentilly, was raided Saturday by police. Terrorist's hideout apartment raided Also found inside the apartment, according to Le Parisien: a stash of weapons, explosives and two ISIS flags. Coulibaly purportedly told authorities before he was killed that he belonged to ISIS. Police also suspect the man may have been responsible for shooting and wounding a jogger last week – an attack that the Paris prosecutor has said could be tied to Coulibaly because the ammunition used was the same as ammunition found at the scene of the kosher market attack, Le Parisien said. Paris police would not comment to CNN on the contents of the report. Le Parisien says Coulibaly’s accomplice, who the newspaper did not name, is suspected to have fled France, possibly for Syria. Officials have also said they believe Hayat Boumeddiene, Coulibaly’s widow who may have played a role in the attacks, has fled to Syria. With France on its highest level of alert, 10,000 troops have deployed across the country. Thousands of police officers are on patrol, including hundreds assigned to protect Jewish schools. Since the attacks, dozens of cases have been opened in France against people accused of expressing support for terrorism, the Justice Ministry said. It’s unclear how many people are blamed for the 54 infractions. The cases include investigations involving phone threats, cyberattacks and Facebook posts, the ministry said. Some are in prison awaiting trial, some have already been convicted, and some have been released with a notice of a court date, ministry spokesman Pierre Rance said. Penalties for the alleged crimes vary, Rance said. Justice Minister Christiane Taubira “considers that words or actions of a racist or anti-Semitic nature, or that cause hateful, violent, or discriminatory behavior, or advocate terrorism, or target security forces must be fought and pursued with the utmost vigor,” her office said in a statement. She “asked prosecutors to exercise extreme reactivity in the conduct of public action against the perpetrators of such crimes,” the statement said. With concerns on the rise, a controversial French comedian was accused of publicly supporting terrorism, French media reported. Dieudonne M’bala M’bala, known as Dieudonne, was arrested in Paris, according to media reports, which tied his arrest to a recent Facebook post from the comedian. “Je suis Charlie Coulibaly,” the post said, combined the last name of one of the terrorists involved in last week’s attacks with the widely used phrase expressing solidarity with victims. That post has since been deleted. French comic faces 7 years in prison for Facebook post Dieudonne has previously been fined several times in France for anti-Semitic commentary. Last year, the French government said it wanted to ban his live performances. And British authorities banned him from entering the United Kingdom. On Monday, Dieudonne issued a statement with his stance on the terror attacks. “Since the beginning of last year, I have been treated as public enemy number one, when all I try to do is make people laugh, and laugh about death,” he wrote in a letter to the French interior minister. “Because death laughs at us all, as Charlie knows now, unfortunately.” After his release from custody Wednesday, his lawyer told France’s iTELE network that the comedian returned to performing his act at a theater in the same Paris neighborhood where Charlie Hebdo’s offices are located.

Nasr al-Ansi, who had been serving as an ideological leader, was among several fighters killed in a CIA drone strike on April 21, Martin confirms. Washington considers AQAP to be the most powerful in the terrorist network. Al-Ansi's death was announced by al Qaeda operative Khaled Batarfi in a video posted on the Internet. Batarfi did not say when or where in Yemen he was killed, adding only that al-Ansi's eldest son, Mohammed, and several fighters were killed in the same airstrike. Al-Ansi, believed to have been close to al Qaeda's late leader Osama Bin Laden, has made several video appearances on behalf of the group's Yemen branch. In January, he announced that the Yemen branch was responsible for the attack on the offices of the French satirical magazine that killed 12 people. After the attacks, AQAP posted an 11-minute video on the group's Twitter account and al-Ansi warned of more \"tragedies and terror\" in the future. Al-Ansi said AQAP \"chose the target, laid out the plan and financed the operation.\" He said the radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in September 2011, had arranged the attack. Al-Ansi's death comes less than a month after AQAP announced that its top cleric, a Saudi-national who had a $5 million bounty on his head, was killed in an alleged drone attack. In late March, about 100 U.S. military advisers withdrew from the al-Annad air base where they had been leading the U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Yemen. Washington rarely comments on drone attacks. U.S. officials had been concerned their counterterrorism capabilities would be diminished because of the withdrawal of their staff. However, they said the al Qaeda branch will likely be drawn toward the internal Yemeni conflict, and away from plotting to go after Western targets. Al Qaeda is a staunch rival of the Shiite rebels, and has already waged a number of attacks against their advances. U.S. officials also said that CIA drone strikes would continue but that there will be fewer of them First published on May 7, 2015 / 4:04 PM EDT © 2015 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The announcement marks the end of an era for the company, which came under intense scrutiny for its controversial practices and the breach of millions of users' personal data.\n\nCambridge Analytica, once hailed for its data-driven approach to political campaigning, has been mired in controversy since the revelation that it harvested data from millions of Facebook users without their consent. The scandal, which broke in 2018, exposed the firm's intricate ties to the Trump campaign and raised concerns about the manipulation of public opinion through digital means.\n\nThe company, co-founded by psychometrics expert Aleksandr Kogan and former Trump campaign data director Steve Bannon, used algorithms and psychological profiling to target swing voters with personalized messaging. Their methods were believed to have played a significant role in shaping the discourse and influencing the outcome of the 2016 US election.\n\nHowever, the firm's practices came under the microscope as it was revealed that Kogan shared the data with a third party, the University of Cambridge's psychologist, who in turn allowed it to be harvested by Cambridge Analytica. This data breach, which potentially encompassed the personal information of millions of Facebook users, sparked investigations by both U.S. and European authorities.\n\nAs the dust settled, Cambridge Analytica was faced with legal challenges, including lawsuits from affected individuals and regulatory inquiries. The company struggled to weather the financial and reputational fallout, leading to a series of setbacks and a loss of key personnel. In a bid to address the mounting debts, the firm has now announced its intention to shut down and file for liquidation.\n\nThe closure represents a definitive end to an era in political campaigning that blurred the lines between data privacy and political power. Cambridge Analytica's story serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of unchecked data harvesting and manipulation, and has led to increased calls for stricter regulations on data privacy and the use of personal information in political advertising.\n\nAs the firm's assets are清算, questions remain over the fate of its employees and the potential for any lingering legal liabilities. It is clear, however, that the legacy of Cambridge Analytica will long live on, shaping the public's perception of data-driven politics and resetting the discourse on ethics in the digital age.\n\nIn the aftermath of its closure, the world is left to ponder what the future holds for data analytics in politics – a future where the balance between innovation and responsibility will continue to be a defining challenge for those working in this field. Meanwhile, the Cambridge Analytica saga serves as a stark lesson on the importance of safeguarding personal data and ensuring that political campaigns are conducted with integrity and respect for privacy.", "token_usage": 596, "human_written_evidences": ["– cambridge analytica is calling it quits . the data firm that worked for now-president trump ' s 2016 campaign became embroiled in controversy following revelations that it misused the facebook data of millions of people , and nigel oakes , the founder of its british affiliate scl , tells the wall street journal both companies are shutting down . a source says the company was losing clients in the wake of the data harvesting scandal and also faced significant legal fees due to the facebook investigation . cambridge analytica ceo alexander nix had also been suspended in march after video was released showing him bragging about allegedly influencing elections , among other things . the firm is closing effective wednesday . gizmodo has an inside look at the lead-up to the conference call announcing its closure , down to the bleak jokes employees made in anticipation of it .\n"], "reference_documents": ["cambridge analytica , a data firm that worked for president donald trump ’ s 2016 campaign , is shutting down following allegations about its misuse of facebook data and the campaign tactics it pitched to clients . in march , the company suspended its chief executive , alexander nix , and said it was launching an independent investigation to determine if the company engaged in any wrongdoing in its work on political campaigns . the ... story_separator_special_tag photo : getty on wednesday , cambridge analytica employees learned that its parent company , the scl group , was shuttering the business , with american-based workers directed to return their keycards immediately , according to documentation reviewed by gizmodo . the news was announced during a conference call led by julian wheatland , the current chairman of the scl group who was reportedly tapped to take over as cambridge analytica ’ s next ceo . both cambridge analytica and scl elections ( the scl group subsidiary connected to cambridge analytica ) will now close their doors . advertisement during the call , wheatland said that the board determined that rebranding the company ’ s offerings in the current environment is “futile. ” cambridge analytica and the scl group have offices in london , new york city , arlington , virginia , and washington , d.c. the conference call was originally scheduled for tuesday morning , but was repeatedly pushed back until early wednesday afternoon , ultimately getting rescheduled more than half a dozen times . screenshots from the company ’ s internal chat service obtained by gizmodo show a darkly comic mood in anticipation of the call . one employee shared bleakly titled spotify playlists in slack featuring songs like “high and dry ” by radiohead , “the end ” by the doors , and “help ! ” by the beatles . another employee posted a still from titanic showing the ship ’ s band playing their instruments as the vessel sinks . advertisement in explaining the decision to close the offices , wheatland cited the ongoing investigations into cambridge analytica ’ s massive data harvesting scandal , damage to the company ’ s reputation , and loss of clients . in march , britain ’ s information commissioner announced that she was seeking a warrant to investigate any misconduct by the data analytics firm , looking to search both its offices and its servers . uk authorities raided the london office later that month , but have yet to release their findings . meanwhile , embattled former ceo alexander nix refused to testify before the british parliamentary media committee regarding the firm ’ s misuse of facebook user data . we have reached out to cambridge analytica for more information and will update this story if we hear back . update 2 : 10pm : speaking to the wall street journal , scl group founder nigel oakes confirmed that both cambridge analytica and the scl group are shutting down . advertisement update\n"], "model_retrieved_documents": ["Watch CBS News May 2, 2018 / 2:59 PM EDT / CBS News Cambridge Analytica, a U.K.-based political consulting firm at the center of the recent Facebook data scandal, is \"immediately ceasing all operations,\" the company said in a statement on Wednesday. \"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company's customers and suppliers,\" the firm said. \"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration.\" The statement said the company will soon begin bankruptcy proceedings in the U.K. and the U.S. The company said it has \"unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully.\" The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo first reported the news. A source close to the matter told the Journal that the company is closing its doors because it lost several clients in recent months and faces growing legal fees as part of the Facebook investigation. Cambridge Analytica has been at the heart of the data scandal that has rocked Facebook, the world's largest social network, and led to calls for more regulation of user data. Facebook banned the political data analysis firm in March, and said it believes data from up to 87 million people was \"improperly shared\" with Cambridge Analytica. \"Facebook's trying to move past this all, and this is kind of the next step in that,\" Ian Sherr, the executive editor of CNET News, said about Cambridge Analytica's closure. \"This company is no longer going to be a thorn in their side in the real world. It's now a rhetorical thorn in their side that people will bring up quite often whenever concerned about privacy.\" The man who mined who data for Cambridge Analytica is a scientist named Aleksandr Kogan. He developed an app that harvested data from tens of millions of unwitting Facebook users, CBS News' Lesley Stahl reported last month for \"60 Minutes.\" He asked Facebook users to take a survey and used their answers to build psychological profiles meant to predict their behavior. When doing that, he failed to disclose that what he was really after was access to their friends -- tens of millions of people he could not otherwise reach easily. He also didn't disclose that he was doing the survey for Cambridge Analytica, which used the material to influence people on behalf of political clients. Kogan acknowledged giving the data to Cambridge Analytica and apologized for his actions in the \"60 Minutes\" interview. He said he was \"sincerely sorry\" about the way he and \"tens of thousands\" of other app developers took advantage of what he said was Facebook's lax data policy enforcement, but he doesn't think he really did anything wrong. As political consultants, Cambridge Analytica was hired by campaigns to analyze voters and target them with ads. In the 2016 presidential election, it worked first for Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign, then later for Donald Trump, though his campaign says they didn't use the Kogan data. The Republican benefactors Robert and Rebekah Mercer were Cambridge Analytica's financial backers, and Steve Bannon was on the board. Cambridge Analytica suspended chief executive Alexander Nix in March after he and other senior executives at the firm were caught on video saying they would go beyond using data to hurt a client's rival political candidate. Those tactics, Nix said in a report broadcast by the U.K.'s Channel 4, included entrapping politicians to influence an election's outcome. Late last month, Kogan took questions from British lawmakers. First published on May 2, 2018 / 2:59 PM EDT © 2018 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

The company will begin bankruptcy proceedings, it said, after losing clients and facing mounting legal fees resulting from the scandal over reports the company harvested personal data about millions of Facebook users beginning in 2014. “The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers,” the statement said. “As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.” Allegations of the improper use of data for 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Donald Trump’s 2016 U.S. election campaign, has hurt the shares of the world’s biggest social network and prompted multiple official investigations in the United States and Europe. Related Coverage “Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,” the company’s statement said. The firm is shutting down effective Wednesday and employees have been told to turn in their computers, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier. The Cambridge Analytica sign had been removed from the reception area of its London offices on Wednesday. At SCL’s Washington, D.C. office, a man declined to answer questions from a Reuters reporter. After the announcement, Britain’s data regulator said it would continue civil and criminal investigations of the firm and will pursue “individuals and directors as appropriate” despite the shutdown. “We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded,” a spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner’s Office said in a statement. Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported. Cambridge Analytica marketed itself as a provider of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients. After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm’s help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a “secret sauce” it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could. One unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia is whether Russia’s Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time messages during the campaign that were anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive. Bannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm, and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation.

Issie Lapowsky Cambridge Analytica, the embattled data firm that worked on President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, has told employees it is shutting down, along with its UK counterpart SCL Elections. The move, which impacts all offices of both companies worldwide, comes amid recent revelations that the company harvested the data of up to 87 million Facebook users without their consent, according to multiple sources close to the company. The decision to close the company's doors internationally was announced to employees during a global town hall meeting, held in the firm's New York City offices Wednesday. The company's reportedly recently appointed CEO Julian Wheatland told staffers the company had evaluated all options and no longer saw a way forward. One source says that New York employees were told to pack up and leave immediately, with few details about how they'll be compensated going forward. The feeling in the room was \"just shock,\" says the source. “There was indication the company was in trouble and change would be coming, but we didn’t see this as the resolution.\" SCL Elections and \"certain of its affiliates,\" including Cambridge Analytica, are beginning insolvency proceedings in the UK and filing for bankruptcy in the United States, according to a statement from the data firm's US-based branch. \"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers,\" the statement read. \"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration.\" Gizmodo first reported that Cambridge Analytica's US offices would shut down. According to a source, the decision also impacts SCL Defense, which has done work for the US government. The Wall Street Journal reports that SCL Group founder Nigel Oakes confirmed both SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica are closing. In March, The New York Times, alongside The Guardian and The Observer, published simultaneous accounts from a former whistleblower named Christopher Wylie, who reported that Cambridge Analytica had hired a researcher to conduct a psychological profile of the American electorate. The researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, built a personality quiz app that collected data on anyone who took it, as well as on their friends. Kogan sold that data to Cambridge Analytica to develop so-called \"psychographic profiles\" of American voters. Hours before the news broke, Facebook cut Cambridge Analytica and SCL off from its platform, deeply wounding a company that had already lost market share in both its political and commercial business. Shortly after, Channel 4 news in the UK aired undercover videos in which the former CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, was recorded bragging about using underhanded tactics like bribery and entrapment on behalf of his clients. In the statement put out by Cambridge Analytica, the company noted the results of an internal investigation which concluded that the allegations against it were not \"borne out by the facts.” Angela Watercutter Steven Levy Steven Levy Andy Greenberg Nix was removed as CEO in March, but the company vowed to press on. Just yesterday, Cambridge Analytica's official Twitter account tweeted out a link to a website refuting the waves of bad press the company has received with the caption, \"Get the Facts Behind the Facebook Story.\" In March, Business Insider reported that several of Cambridge Analytica's key players had set up a separate company called Emerdata in the UK last year. Cambridge Analytica's main funder Rebekah Mercer sits on that company's board. Cambridge Analytica and SCL continue to be the subject of an investigation by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office into the role both companies played in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

Ad Choices", "May 2 (UPI) — Cambridge Analytica announced Wednesday it is shutting down amid accusations the data-mining firm improperly accessed data from millions of Facebook users. The British-based company and its affiliate, SCL Elections, are filing insolvency proceedings in Britain and bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. Cambridge Analytica said a “siege of media coverage” of its dealings with Facebook has driven away customers, leaving the business no longer viable. It said reports about how it obtained and used Facebook user data were unfounded. “Despite the company’s efforts to correct the record, [it] has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,” the company said in a statement. Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research used the quiz app “This Is Your Digital Life” to gather data on 270,000 users — and the users’ friends, who did not participate in the quiz — which it then shared with Cambridge Analytica in 2015. The company used the demographic information from 87 million Facebook users to target political advertising. In March, whistleblower and Cambridge Analytica co-founder Christopher Wylie revealed the company was holding onto user data without their consent even after Facebook told the company to delete it. Wylie said the company was initially funded by billionaire Robert Mercer and his boss was former Breitbart founder and White House adviser Steve Bannon. Wylie said leadership at Cambridge Analytica wanted to fight a “culture war.” “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair,” he said. “They want to fight a culture war in America.” “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.” Wylie said he used coding to execute Bannon and Mercer’s idea to combine big data and social media to target Facebook users based on psychological profiles. On March 20, Cambridge Analytica suspended CEO Alexander Nix and said it was investigating comments Nix made in an undercover recording. He said the company could secretly compromise political rivals by arranging smear campaigns, setting up encounters with prostitutes and staging bribery situations. Counsel Julian Malins, who conducted Cambridge Analytica’s internal investigation, said allegations against the firm were not “borne out by the facts.” “I had full access to all members of staff and documents in the preparation of my report,” Malins said. “My findings entirely reflect the amazement of the staff, on watching the television programmes and reading the sensationalistic reporting, that any of these media outlets could have been talking about the company for which they worked. Nothing of what they heard or read resonated with what they actually did for a living.” President Donald Trump’s campaign used the services of Cambridge Analytica for the 2016 presidential election.

Copyright © 2023 Breitbart", "By Christi Carras subscriber Data consulting firm Cambridge Analytica is shutting down in the wake of the Facebook data breach scandal that resulted in the lifting of personal data from up to 87 million Facebook users off the platform without their consent. The United Kingdom-based company that collaborated with Donald Trump’s presidential campaign made the decision to close its doors after many of its largest clients walked out — a result of accusations that it used leaked personal data to inform political campaigns. The firm violated Facebook’s policy in order to obtain knowledge from user accounts. Cambridge Analytica released a statement Wednesday on its closure, and said it was “vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.” Its parent company, SCL, will also shut down.

Over the decades, the agency has undergone a remarkable transformation, adapting to technological advancements and shifting global threats. Its surveillance capabilities have evolved from the shadows into a central player in the complex landscape of digital intelligence, shaping the way we understand privacy and security.\n\nThe Early Years: A Secretive Birth\n\nEstablished during the height of the Cold War, the NSA was initially tasked with intercepting and decrypting communications from potential adversaries, primarily the Soviet Union. Its inception was marked by a veil of secrecy, intended to safeguard both the agency's methods and the nation's strategic interests. Under the directive of President Harry S. Truman, the agency's first priority was to guard against espionage and maintain a technological edge in the nascent age of telecommunications.\n\nThe Digital Revolution: A Stealthy Surveillance Network\n\nThe 1970s and 80s witnessed a rapid expansion of the NSA's reach, as it began to embrace new technologies that enabled mass surveillance. With the advent of computers, the agency developed sophisticated software to track and analyze telephone and mail communications. By the early 1990s, the launch of the first global positioning system (GPS) paved the way for the agency to monitor satellite signals, further solidifying its role as a key player in the intelligence community.\n\nThe Internet Age: A Bold Leap into the Digital Frontier\n\nThe 1990s marked a turning point for the NSA, as the rise of the internet opened up unprecedented opportunities for surveillance. The agency adapted its infrastructure and expertise to tap into the digital realm, developing programs like PRISM, which allowed for mass collection of data from major tech companies. The revelations of Edward Snowden in 2013 exposed the extent of this surveillance, igniting a global debate on privacy and government oversight.\n\nThe Post-Snowden Era: Transparency and Adaptation\n\nFollowing Snowden's disclosures, the NSA faced increased scrutiny and calls for accountability. In response, the agency has taken steps to address public concerns while maintaining its surveillance capabilities. It has implemented more rigorous oversight mechanisms, engaged in dialogue with civil liberties advocates, and attempted to balance national security with individual privacy rights.\n\nRecent Developments: Quantum Computing and the Future\n\nAs technology continues to evolve, so does the NSA's focus. With the advent of quantum computing, which could potentially render existing encryption methods obsolete, the agency is investing in research to stay ahead of the curve. The NSA's future will involve not only protecting against cyber threats but also ensuring the resilience of encryption standards to maintain the confidentiality of personal data.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe NSA's evolution from a Cold War-era监听机构 to a modern, technology-driven intelligence powerhouse is a testament to the agency's adaptability and resilience. As it navigates the challenges of a digital age, the NSA must strike a delicate balance between safeguarding national security and respecting individual privacy rights in the ever-evolving landscape of surveillance and digital intelligence. The ongoing debate on the role and limits of state surveillance will likely remain a critical topic in the years to come.", "token_usage": 678, "human_written_evidences": ["– a lengthy report in the new york times , based on thousands of documents shared by the guardian via edward snowden , offers an in-depth look at an agency that can \" seem omniscient , \" with eyes everywhere tracking even the smallest matters . the material obtained — whether years of stored text messages , \" gigabytes of credit card purchases , \" or eavesdropped conversations — can be of great value : scott shane writes about operations that stopped a terrorist plot against a swedish illustrator , helped kennedy international airport battle chinese human smugglers , and gave the colombian army details of farc rebel plans . but plenty of collected data is never looked at , despite the effort to obtain it . and some material seems hardly useful ; the paper cites the agency ' s successful grab at un secretary-general ban ki-moon ' s talking points for a meeting with president obama . meanwhile , despite the nsa ' s incredible reach in afghanistan , it hasn ' t offered a path to \" clear-cut strategic success \" in the country , the times notes . the paper ' s investigation , while raising a range of key questions , presents a wealth of details on the nsa ' s functioning ; the agency hopes to \" utterly master \" foreign intelligence and gives great value to \" the moral high ground . \" click for the full piece .\n"], "reference_documents": ["the n.s.a. ’ s evolution : the national security agency was founded in 1952 , and its surveillance capabilities were limited by legislation in 1978. but with the attacks of september 2001 came a new sense of urgency . when ban ki-moon , the united nations secretary general , sat down with president obama at the white house in april to discuss syrian chemical weapons , israeli-palestinian peace talks and climate change , it was a cordial , routine exchange . the national security agency nonetheless went to work in advance and intercepted mr. ban ’ s talking points for the meeting , a feat the agency later reported as an “operational highlight ” in a weekly internal brag sheet . it is hard to imagine what edge this could have given mr. obama in a friendly chat , if he even saw the n.s.a. ’ s modest scoop .

It was a beautiful day under a sparkling blue sky, and as he sped down Maryland’s Route 32 with the window down and radio blasting, the teenager was sure it was going to be a lucky day. Soon after 8.46am the radio cut to news that a plane had crashed into one of the Twin Towers in New York City. At 9.03am, by now at his desk, he was stunned to hear that a second plane had crashed into the other tower, followed half an hour later by similar catastrophe at the Pentagon in Washington. He leapt back into his car and screeched into reverse, only to find himself stuck in gridlocked traffic sandwiched between hundreds of other vehicles. He was stuck outside the headquarters of the National Security Agency (NSA), the US intelligence body that runs one of the largest surveillance operations in the world. The road was jammed with personnel streaming out of the NSA building following an order to evacuate. The air was thick with the sound of yelling, cellphones ringing, car engines revving vainly in the stationary traffic. The surreal spectacle of thousands of NSA intelligence agents abandoning their posts after the worst terrorist attack on the US, only to be bogged down in gridlock, made a deep impression on the teenager, Edward Snowden. As did 9/11 itself, which radically changed the course of his life. In its wake, Snowden became caught up in the surge of patriotism that swept the nation. Inspired to play his part, he joined the army, entered the intelligence community, and some 12 years after 9/11 found himself back at the same NSA where he had ground to a halt on that fateful day. The attacks on the Twin Towers and Pentagon had brought Snowden deep into the heart of America’s secretive surveillance operations. But in the process it had given him access to highly classified databases that revealed to him a massive secret world, a sort of hidden state-within-the-state that had been created in the wake of 9/11. Snowden would go on to carry out the largest intelligence leak in the NSA’s history. It would expose one of the great legacies of 9/11 – the rise of the ubiquitous US surveillance state. “Panic made us politically vulnerable,” Snowden told the Guardian as he ruminated on the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11. “That vulnerability was exploited by our own government to entitle itself to radically expanded powers that had for decades been out of reach.” Snowden said that upon reflection the explosion of domestic spying post-9/11 should have been anticipated. “We should have known what was to come and, looking back at the public record, I think that on an intellectual level many of us did know. But political and media elites relentlessly repeated that the choice here was obvious: a guarantee of life or a certainty of death.” That teenager on 9/11 is now an exile from his own country, charged under the Espionage Act for having revealed the US government’s mass espionage on its own people. The way he sees it 20 years on, the false claim that expanding state power was necessary to avoid certain death from further terrorist atrocities has led to decades of public indifference. “With that framing, who could care whether or not the gloves came off the machinery of state? We are only now beginning to care again – to care collectively – because we sit at the bottom of a 20-year hole carved by our neglect.” It happened in the blink of an eye. Within hours of the fourth plane crashing into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, George Bush’s White House and intelligence chiefs had begun to lay the foundations of the mass surveillance state. The Patriot Act, which swatted away longstanding rules preventing the state from monitoring US citizens without “probable cause”, was passed in a lightning-fast 45 days. The legislation became law with minimal debate or opposition in Congress, granting domestic law enforcement agencies sweeping new powers. It allowed the government to track the online behavior of Americans while making it much easier to acquire a warrant. It gave the green light for the FBI and CIA to carry out “roving wiretaps” where agents could follow communications trails between phones and computers. It eviscerated the firewall that had been in place since the 1970s shielding US citizens from foreign surveillance. And it greatly boosted the power of the FBI to obtain personal customer records of Americans from phone companies, banks and internet providers without court approval through so-called National Security Letters. If the Patriot Act was produced in a flash, behind the scenes secret systems for mass surveillance were being built at even greater speed. One of the most audacious plans was drafted by nightfall on the day of 11 September itself. The plan, ominously titled “Total information awareness”, was the brainchild of John Poindexter, a disgraced former naval officer who had been Ronald Reagan’s national security adviser and a key figure in the Iran-contra scandal. TIA, Poindexter blustered, would act as an early-warning alarm for future 9/11s by gathering up the digital data of all Americans – innocent or guilty – and using it to search for patterns of terrorist activity. No warrants would be sought. They would just do it, irrespective of laws or constitutional niceties. “We must put introduction of new technology on a wartime basis,” Poindexter said. Weeks later he managed to sell the idea to the Pentagon in return for a $200m budget. The NSA wasn’t far behind. The agency was busy devising Stellar Wind, its warrantless surveillance system. It sought to identify terrorist links by analysing the metadata drawn from the emails, telephone calls and internet activity of huge numbers of Americans. The Snowden documents showed that by 14 September – just three days after the attacks – the then director of the NSA, Michael Hayden, had taken a “tactical decision” to begin snooping on the digital communications of people based in the US. From now on, the NSA granted itself the power to surveil any American on US soil who was in digital contact with a foreign country where terrorism was known to exist – no warrant needed. This was a seismic shift. It meant that the nation’s most powerful eavesdropping agency had ascribed to itself, without consulting Congress or the courts, the ability to listen in to the communications of Americans in a way that violated constitutional rights and laws. On 4 October 2001 the White House granted permission, again in secret and without consultation, for the NSA to turn its spotlight on to US citizens in what became known as the President’s Surveillance Program. “They essentially claimed wartime authority to engage in domestic surveillance that is criminal under statutory law,” said Ben Wizner, Snowden’s lawyer, who works on surveillance at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). How could the spymasters have moved to put in place complex systems of mass surveillance just hours and days after 9/11? There is only one answer, many observers believe. “They had it all ready,” said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which defends civil liberties in the digital space. “This is what the NSA had long wanted – to ‘sit on the wire’, to watch all internet traffic and pick out whatever they chose. Now they finally had the crisis they needed to make it happen.” By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, an entire nation within the nation had arisen dedicated to keeping the American people nominally safe by placing everybody under observation. The Washington Post called it a “Top Secret America hidden from public view”. The sprawling surveillance infrastructure had proliferated to the extent that nobody – not even top intelligence officials – knew how much it cost or how many it employed. The Post’s best estimate in July 2010 was that it spanned 10,000 locations across the US. The scale of growth can be glimpsed by looking at some of the public elements. The number of National Security Letters granted each year increased more than fourfold between 2000 and 2003, peaking at almost 60,000 the following year. By 2008 almost 20,000 people were being targeted under its remit. The intelligence budget grew from a little over $40bn a year in the late 1990s to almost $100bn by 2010, remaining $80bn to this day. When Wizner looks back on the past 20 years he is struck not just by this explosion in surveillance but also by the failure of governance that enabled it. Key institutions like the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court, which is supposed to provide legal oversight, genuflected in front of the NSA. “This is a story about checks and balances failing,” Wizner said. “The courts deferred to the expertise and secrecy claims of the executive, Congress failed to hold the intelligence agencies accountable.” Even the media fell short of holding power to account. When in 2005 the New York Times revealed the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping, the newspaper admitted that it had sat on the story for a year at the behest of the White House. The LA Times spiked a story brought to it by a whistleblower who revealed that the telecom company AT&T had handed over all its internet traffic to the NSA. The paper had been lobbied by Hayden and the then director of national intelligence, John Negroponte. Traditional oversight did have some successes. Ron Wyden, a US senator for Oregon, managed to have Poindexter’s Total Information Awareness program shut down in 2003, after an intern in his office stumbled across documents describing the operation. “That was one of our first wins – it would have been the biggest spying operation in history,” Wyden said. (Three years later it was revealed that elements of the program had secretly been transferred from the Pentagon to the NSA.) Wyden, a longstanding member of the Senate select committee on intelligence, has been at the forefront of efforts to force sunlight into the world of secret surveillance. As the 10th anniversary of 9/11 was approaching he issued his famous warning on the Senate floor, telling the American people that when they found out how the government had interpreted the Patriot Act “they will be stunned and they will be angry”. In another legendary moment two years later, he posed a direct question to the then director of national intelligence, James Clapper, about whether the NSA was collecting data on hundreds of millions of Americans. “No, sir,” Clapper lied. Wyden told the Guardian that the exchange showed how far the government had allowed itself to slide in terms of basic American values. “James Clapper lied to the American people and he lied to the committee. It wasn’t the only time they lied – they lied several times over the years, which is why I finally said I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t ask the question I did in public.” It is a paradox of Wyden’s attempts to wrench surveillance into the open that despite his efforts the full truth about the massive dragnet of all Americans’ digital communications remained concealed. As a member of the committee, the senator was briefed in secret about the warrantless eavesdropping but was constrained by what he has called the “cumbersome and unwieldy” restrictions on his public remarks. The Guardian asked Wyden whether he thought, with the benefit of hindsight over these past 20 years, that Congress could have done more to check the intelligence agencies. “You look back, and the answer is: sure. You keep pushing the rock up the hill and you have wins, and there are times when you wish there had been stronger support for reform.” Before Edward Snowden there was Mark Klein. He was the whistleblower who exposed the AT&T story that the LA Times declined to publish. Klein was a technician assigned to the internet room of AT&T’s Folsom Street building in San Francisco through which colossal quantities of data passed every hour. It was 2004 and unbeknown to the public the telecoms company had been bending over backwards since days after 9/11 to help the US government spy on its own people. As Klein went about routine maintenance, his eye was drawn to a splitter cabinet inside the room. It was dividing the light beam carrying the data into two separate signals, and passing one of them – an exact copy of the other – down to the floor below. Klein’s curiosity intensified when he tried to follow the signal and found that the lower room was locked behind a door marked 641A. Nobody was allowed in without special authorization from the NSA. When Klein obtained internal engineering documents outlining the flow of data through the splitter cabinet down to the secret room, his suspicions were confirmed. The NSA was copying and collecting everybody’s information carried not only by AT&T but also by 16 other internet providers who shared the pipeline. “I was horrified and astonished. It was like a police state, sweeping up everybody’s information blindly and allowing agents to go through it at their leisure.” Klein’s discovery was made public by Wired magazine in 2006. The documents he obtained went on to form the basis of a major lawsuit launched by the EFF, though in 2008 Congress passed a law absolving AT&T and other phone companies from any legal liability for collaborating with the spy chiefs. Mark Klein, Thomas Tamm, Thomas Drake, William Binney, Kirk Wiebe, Edward Loomis, Diane Roark – the list of individuals who, for a variety of motives, provided critical information to investigative journalists seeking to expose the surveillance state is long and impressive. Without them, given the failure of checks and balances, we might still be in the dark today. “Everything we know about mass surveillance we know not because of our government institutions but despite them,” Wizner said. “We know because of courageous sources and journalists who pried those stories out into the light.” And then there was Snowden. On 6 June 2013 – almost 12 years after 9/11 – the first incendiary story exposing the NSA’s dragnet of the telephone records of millions of Verizon customers was published by the Guardian. The next day the paper reported on Prism, a system for sucking up data from US internet giants including Google and Facebook. The lid on the secret US surveillance state had finally been lifted. One of the documents Snowden disclosed neatly encapsulated the NSA’s posture: “Sniff It All, Know It All, Collect It All, Process It All, Exploit It All, Partner It All.” Snowden has an even more vivid way of summing up the public consequences of the closed world he had bust open. In his memoir Permanent Record he writes: “All of us had been reduced to something like children, who’d be forced to live the rest of our lives under omniscient parental supervision.” It is tempting to think of the mass surveillance put in place post-9/11 as a great leveler – after all, the NSA did grab the metadata of all Americans irrespective of race, class or religion. But to suggest that 9/11 gave birth to a new equality of snooping under the government’s all-seeing eye would be a travesty. Surveillance has always fallen unevenly in the US, stretching back to the days when slaves were required to carry lanterns at night so they could be followed. After 9/11 it was the turn of Muslims. “The Patriot Act was the stepping stone for what became open season on American Muslims,” said Nihad Awad, the executive director of the advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “There were no rules. The government just said ‘Let’s go after Muslims.’” Before 9/11 Awad had been invited to sit on White House advisory committees. After 9/11 he and his family would routinely be stopped and searched at airports and treated like criminals. “We became the enemy,” he said. For years Awad was puzzled by the hostile stories in the press containing personal details, the banks that refused to do business with him. He had to wait until Snowden to make sense of what was happening. An investigation by the Intercept based on the Snowden files showed that Awad had been placed on a top-secret list of 7,485 people, many foreigners but also including an unknown number of Americans, whose emails were being monitored by the NSA and FBI. They included other high-profile Muslim Americans including a former Republican candidate, a lawyer and university professors. “When Snowden let us know that I was on the list I realized the government had access to my private emails and were sharing them with Congress and leaking them to the media,” Awad said. “I felt invaded by my own government, punished for leading a civil rights organization. If people like me in positions of influence were treated like this, what about the average Muslim?” Asad Dandia was born and raised in Brooklyn. He was eight years-old on 9/11 and a teenager when his troubles started. As a religiously observant Muslim, he had founded with friends a food distribution charity offering help to struggling families from his community. In March 2012 he was contacted through Facebook by a stranger named Shamiur Rahman who said he wanted to volunteer for a spiritually grounded organization like his. Rahman said he had been through a rough patch himself and now wanted to help others. Dandia welcomed Rahman in. “He quickly grew close to me and to my circles,” he said. “He met my family, he ate my mother’s food, he slept over one night. We shared many intimate moments of emotional and spiritual reflection.” At times Rahman behaved strangely. Whenever Dandia introduced him to anybody the first thing he would do would be to ask for their phone number. He also asked provocative questions, like what Dandia thought of the killing in Benghazi of Christopher Stevens, the US ambassador to Libya. “That was a really dumb question – it was murder and obviously we thought it was wrong,” Dandia said. But he gave Rahman the benefit of the doubt. “I attributed that to the fact he had mental health and drug addiction issues. I thought we should be patient with him.” A few months after Rahman entered his life, Dandia was taken aside by a member of his local Muslim community who was working as an NYPD officer. “You are being watched, there’s a file with your name and photos in it and you are being followed,” he told Dandia. Seven months into their friendship, Rahman posted a confession on Facebook. He was an NYPD informant tasked with infiltrating Muslim groups and mosques. The news travelled fast and sent a chill throughout the area. Mosques asked Dandia to stop fundraising for his food bank as they were afraid of being targeted themselves. Dandia grew reclusive. “It made me suspicious of people. I hid my left-leaning political views and deeper religious commitments. That wasn’t how I wanted to live, in a state of permanent paranoia, but there was a complete breakdown in trust.” Through the Associated Press, Dandia came to learn that he was just a speck in the NYPD’s mountainous surveillance of Muslims. Communities up and down the east coast were mapped through a secret “Demographics Unit” and individuals’ daily habits – shopping, work, prayer, school – tracked on massive CIA-designed databases. Muslims with drug habits who fell into the NYPD’s clutches, like Rahman, were offered lenient treatment in return for turning informant. “I felt betrayed,” Dandia said. “I was born and raised in New York. This is the city that I love and that I’m proud to call my home. It targeted me because of my religion, like a foreign enemy.” Since Snowden shone his laser beam into the secret surveillance state-within-a-state, there has been a concerted effort to restore the balance, destroyed after 9/11, between individual liberties and national security. The USA Freedom Act in 2015 curtailed some of the NSA’s metadata practices, passing the storage of bulk phone records from the agency to the phone companies, and opening up the foreign intelligence surveillance court to a modicum of public scrutiny. It was the first time since the 1970s that Congress had limited the NSA’s authority in any way. “We have closed great swathes of the internet to the oldest methods of mass surveillance,” Snowden told the Guardian. In 2019 the NSA let it be known that it had shut down its mass collection of phone and text records. The NSA cited “technical irregularities”, but by then it was widely known that the spying program had not only been illegal in its inception, it just hadn’t worked. Despite the NSA’s claim that by snooping on all Americans’ communications it had thwarted numerous other 9/11s, the agency could only point to one terrorism case, that of Basaalay Moalin, found guilty of funding Somali extremism, that had come through the phone records program. Last year a federal judge concluded that even Moalin’s case had been irrelevant: the NSA played no role in his conviction. There have been other victories in the battle against the surveillance state. Wyden was heartened by the vote in the Senate last year on his amendment to protect the browsing history of Americans from secret surveillance. The amendment failed, but by only one vote. “I thought that was very telling, we almost won – that wouldn’t have happened 15 years ago.” Asad Dandia signed up to a class-action lawsuit challenging the NYPD’s mass surveillance of him and so many other Muslim Americans. In 2016 they achieved a groundbreaking settlement that sharply reined in police targeting of religious and racial groups. “I felt empowered, it gave me hope that Americans can push the country to live up to its own ideals,” he said. Perhaps the biggest shift has been among the American people. The urge of individuals to protect themselves against state eavesdropping became so intense that tech giants were forced to respond and in 2016, for the first time since the internet was created, it carried more encrypted data than unencrypted. Which is not to say that the state-within-a-state has withered away, or that the balance between privacy and security has been perfected. “Not even close,” Cohn said. The Guardian asked surveillance experts what, in the present moment, keeps them up at night. What dastardly new tricks from the spymasters do they fear most? Wyden pointed to legal loopholes that allow shady private data brokers to sell Americans’ personal information to government agencies without any court oversight. “I continue to be very worried about that,” he said. Snowden raised a similar shift, where mass surveillance is now predominantly performed by “amoral telecommunications and surveillance-masquerading-as-advertising companies. They exploit weaknesses in our laws, devices and networks to pad out their dossiers, and then sell them to governments.” Cohn talked about how surveillance cameras were being weaponized with the addition of facial recognition technology that could have especially dire consequences for people of colour. Wizner said he sweated over the rise of robotic surveillance and AI. “More and more we will see critical decisions affecting liberty being made inside black boxes,” he said. For Patrick Toomey of the ACLU’s national security project, what keeps him up at night is simply all of it, the whole technological gamut. “The threat is persistent surveillance – of being surveilled wherever we go using a vast network of devices that can potentially listen to what we say, or recognize who we are based on our faces or the way we walk. There’s a very real danger that this sensitive information will be used to make decisions that are discriminatory or inaccurate, that can profoundly impact our lives.” In the last analysis, the US surveillance state got away with operating in total secret for so many years after 9/11 that it raises the question: are we still in the dark? “This will always be like trying to keep the kibble from the cat,” Snowden said. “So long as they know what they want is out there somewhere, they’re going to work out new ways to get it.”", "Military involvement in domestic law enforcement operations is something Americans have always regarded with deep unease. The framers of the Constitution recognized the threat a standing army posed to democracy and they sought to establish a government that guaranteed civilian supremacy over the military. This ideal was finally codified after the Civil War through the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibited the Army from engaging in law enforcement activities on U.S. soil. But Congress has weakened Posse Comitatus over the years by permitting military involvement in drug enforcement, border control and all sorts of other “domestic support” operations. As a result, the military is increasingly turning its powerful intelligence collection capabilities against Americans. Total Information Awareness. Shortly after 9/11, the Department of Defense’s (DoD) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began a project called “Total Information Awareness” to collect and mine vast amounts of information about the American public, including their telephone records, bank records, medical records, and educational and travel data, in an attempt to identify terrorists. Congress de-funded TIA in 2003 in the wake of the public outcry denouncing such an Orwellian spying operation, but large scale information collection and data mining programs persist, and the military remains heavily involved. NSA’s Warrantless Wiretapping Program. In December 2005 the New York Times revealed that soon after the September 11 attacks, former President Bush authorized the National Security Agency (NSA), an intelligence component of the Defense Department, to conduct warrantless surveillance of American’s e-mails and telephone calls in blatant violation of a federal statute which prohibited the practice (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act). Subsequent articles in USA Today revealed that major telecommunications companies “working under contract to the NSA” also provided the government with millions of Americans’ domestic call data for “social network analysis.” This warrantless surveillance program operated until January 2007. FISA Amendments Act Electronic Surveillance. In 2008 Congress passed a law called the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) which not only legalized the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping program, it actually expanded the NSA’s power to conduct warrantless, suspicion-less dragnet collection of American’s international e-mails and telephone calls. Although very little is known about the government’s implementation of its intrusive FAA spying powers, two New York Times articles (April and July 2009; LINK) revealed the NSA was collecting Americans’ communications under the FAA by the millions and that it was improperly collecting purely domestic communications. National Security Letters. In 2007 an ACLU lawsuit revealed that DoD secretly issued hundreds of national security letters (NSLs) to obtain private and sensitive records of people within the United States without court approval. While the FBI has broad NSL powers and compliance with FBI-issued NSLs is mandatory, DoD’s NSL power is more limited in scope, and, in most cases, compliance with DoD demands is not mandatory. A comprehensive analysis of 455 NSLs issued after 9/11 shows that the DoD seems to have collaborated with the FBI to circumvent the law to use FBI NSLs to obtain records DoD was not authorized to demand for its own investigations. TALON and The Counterintelligence Field Activity Agency (CIFA). But military spying goes far beyond the NSA and abuse of NSLs. In 2003 a highly secretive component of the DoD, the Counterintelligence Field Activity Agency (“CIFA”), began a program to track potential terrorist threats to Department personnel or property within the United States through Threat and Local Observation Notices (“TALON”). These TALON reports were designed to permit civilians and military personnel to report on suspicious activity near defense installations. Not surprisingly, the DOD soon strayed from this limited mission and TALON became a repository for information about peaceful anti-war protesters, and even Quakers. Reports were added to the database even when the “threat” was an anti-war protest that occurred far from any military installation. Other “threats” the military deemed non-credible were never removed from the database. CIFA was disbanded in 2008, but a new office at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) was opened to assume CIFA’s “resources and responsibilities.” In May 2010 DoD announced it was going to participate in a new suspicious activity reporting program through the FBI’s eGuardian program. Then, in June 2010 DIA published a federal register notice announcing the creation of a new data base for information on “individuals involved in, or of interest to, DoD intelligence, counterintelligence, counterterrorism and counter-narcotic operations or analytical projects as well as individuals involved in foreign intelligence and/or training activities” – in short, what appears to be a de facto resurrection of the CIFA program. Political Protest Groups. DoD personnel have also been involved in illegal undercover operations targeting political protest groups. In 2009 a civilian DOD employee working for Fort Lewis Force Protection violated military regulations by infiltrating anti-war protest groups in Olympia, Washington. He used a fake name and posed as a sympathizer for more than a year, all the while reporting the groups’ activities to the local law enforcement agencies he worked with. While the military opened an internal investigation, a leaked 2009 Department of the Army document (“Concept of Operations for Police Intelligence Operations”) claims that Military Police Intelligence units are not subject to legal limitations on domestic military intelligence operations. Fusion Centers and JTTFs. The U.S. military is also involved in intelligence activities conducted through FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) and state and local intelligence fusion centers. For example, DoD is involved in a nationwide FBI investigation that targets returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans to determine if they have become right-wing extremists. DoD’s role in this investigation is likely being coordinated through JTTFs. And though DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano reportedly told the New York Times “that fusion centers were not intended to have a military presence, and that she was not aware of ones that did,” National Guard troops are present in many fusion centers; indeed, the ACLU documented U.S. Army presence at a Maryland fusion center in 2007. Moreover, in 2009 DHS announced it was giving state and local fusion centers access to classified military intelligence in DoD databases. An ongoing scandal involving military personnel and the Los Angeles County Terrorism Early Warning Center (LACTEW), one of the country’s first fusion centers, highlights the lack of oversight in these joint intelligence operations. According to reports from the San Diego Union-Tribune, a group of military reservists and law enforcement officers led by the co-founder of the L.A. fusion center engaged in a years-long conspiracy to steal highly classified intelligence files from the Strategic Technical Operations Center located at the U.S. Marine Corps Base at Camp Pendleton, California and secret surveillance reports from the U.S. Northern Command headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Some of the stolen files reportedly “pertained to surveillance of Muslim communities in Southern California,” including mosques in Los Angeles and San Diego, and revealed “a federal surveillance program targeting Muslim groups” in the United States. The scheme apparently began in 2001 when the LACTEW fusion center’s co-founder called a civilian analyst at U.S. Northern Command to ask that she surreptitiously supply the LACTEW with military surveillance reports. The reported involvement of the National Security Agency in the investigation hints that these records may relate to warrantless domestic surveillance operations conducted by the military. « Back to Suspicious Activity Reporting Programs | Go To Spy Files » Every month, you'll receive regular roundups of the most important civil rights and civil liberties developments.

Archaeologists have made a groundbreaking and unlikely discovery in the Great Plains of Kansas: a sprawling, centuries-old lost city. A few years ago, Donald Blakeslee, an anthropologist and archaeology professor at Wichita State University, discovered the lost city of Etzanoa, located in present-day Arkansas City, Kan. Locals in this small town in south-central Kansas had been finding arrowheads, pottery, and other ancient artifacts in the area’s fields and rivers for decades, but no one ever knew the full extent of the archaeological gold mine hidden underneath their town. According to the Los Angeles Times, Blakeslee used newly translated documents written by the Spanish conquistadors who came across the land over 400 years ago to determine that these artifacts were once part of the Native American lost city of Etzanoa. “‘I thought, ‘Wow, their eyewitness descriptions are so clear it’s like you were there,'” Blakeslee told the Times about reading the conquistador’s accounts. “I wanted to see if the archaeology fit their descriptions. Every single detail matched this place.” The city of Etzanoa is believed to have been around from 1450 to 1700 and was home to approximately 20,000 people. Blakeslee said that the city was the second-largest settlement in the present-day United States at the time and spanned across at least five miles of the space between the Walnut and Arkansas rivers. The 20,000 inhabitants of Etzanoa were said to have lived in “thatched, beehive-shaped houses.” In 1541, conquistador Francisco Vazquez de Coronado came to the town hoping to discover its fabled gold but instead found Native Americans in a collection of settlements that he called Quivira. Sixty years later in 1601, Juan de Oñate led a team of 70 conquistadors from New Mexico to Quivira, also hoping to find its gold but they ran into a tribe called the Escanxaques, who told them of the nearby city of Etzanoa. Oñate and his team arrived at the city and were greeted peacefully by the inhabitants of Etzanoa. However, things quickly went south when the conquistadors started taking hostages, which then caused the city’s residents to flee in fear. The group of conquistadors explored the vast area of more than 2,000 houses but feared an attack from the peoples they dislodged and decided to return home. On their return trip, they were attacked by some 1,000 members of the Escanxaque tribe and a huge battle took place. The conquistadors lost and returned home to New Mexico, never to come back to the area again. French explorers came nearly a century later to that part of south-central Kansas but did not find any evidence of Etzanoa or its people. It is believed that disease caused the untimely demise of the population. However, traces of the people and their city would not stay hidden forever. Blakeslee and a team of excavators found the site of the ancient battle in a neighborhood in Arkansas City and found remanents from the battle. Locals in the area had been uncovering artifacts from the lost city for decades but didn’t understand why until evidence of the city itself was discovered by Blakeslee. “Lots of artifacts have been taken from here,” Warren “Hap” McLeod, a resident of Arkansas City who lives on the spot where the battle took place, told the Times. “Now we know why. There were 20,000 people living here for over 200 years.” David Kelly/The Los Angeles TimesRussell Bishop, a former Arkansas City resident, shows off the arrowheads he found in the area as a kid. One local resident said that the sheer amount of artifacts that people in the area have is mindblowing. “My boss had an entire basement full of pottery and all kinds of artifacts,” Russell Bishop told the Times. “We’d be out there working and he would recognize a black spot on the ground as an ancient campfire site … I don’t think anyone knew how big this all was. I’m glad they’re finally getting to the bottom of it.” The Great Plains were long-regarded as huge, empty spaces in ancient times that were populated mainly by nomadic tribes. But Blakeslee’s discovery of Etzanoa could prove that some of the tribes in the area weren’t nomadic and were actually more urban than previously believed. Blakeslee has also discovered evidence that similar, large-scale lost cities could be located in nearby counties which might have been around during the time of Etzanoa.

There were 20,000 people living here for over 200 years.”", "Dr. Don Blakeslee, Wichita State University professor of anthropology and archaeologist, has shed new light on the significance of the Great Plains in the history of pre-historic North America. By Caelin Bragg The Great Plains has often been overlooked in the history books of North America, but recent discoveries made by a team of Wichita State University archaeologists are rewriting the history of where the beating heart of North American actually was in the pre-historic era before the arrival of Christopher Columbus. According to research findings by Dr. Don Blakeslee, professor of anthropology and archaeologist at Wichita State, it turns out that the Great Plains was much bigger and much more politically and economically influential in North America than previously thought. In 2018, Blakeslee discovered the forgotten town of Etzanoa outside of Arkansas City, Kansas. But what he didn’t know until now is the true extent of what lies underground: An entire nation of ancestors of today’s Wichita tribe towns — called Quivira — totaling more than 200,000 people, who traded goods all across North America and who even had a previously unknown common language. While some early Spanish documents mention Quivira, the region’s significance was until now unknown to the modern understanding of pre-historic North America before Columbus. “It’s going to revolutionize our view of the Great Plains societies, and it already has for me and my students,” Blakeslee said. “Charles Mann wrote (in the book) ‘1491’ about the thriving Native American societies before the time of Columbus in South America, Central America and the American Southeast, but when he talked about the Great Plains, he called them distant and sparsely populated and occupied by hunters and gatherers. No. In its day, Quivira was probably the most important native political unit in what’s now the United States.” The people who created Quivira arrived in Kansas in the late 1300s, and Quivira was fully formed around 1450. The archaeological evidence shows that they grew crops but also hunted bison in huge numbers. Over 80% of the chipped-stone artifacts from the town of Etzanoa are specialized for processing bison products, and documentary evidence shows that these products were exported from coast to coast. This discovery shattered the previous understanding of who the people of the Great Plains were — from hunters and gatherers to a continent-spanning unit. Quivira is barely mentioned in history books because it was as remote as one could get from the early European colonies. Only three Spanish expeditions visited it between 1541 and 1601, and only two of them left documentary records. By the time of the first French visit in 1719, the nation was already in a steep decline. Its collapse started around 1610, when the Spanish founded Santa Fe and initiated a slave trade based on captives from the plains. The French in Canada and the English in Virginia and South Carolina soon joined them in supplying arms to their native allies in exchange for war prisoners. As a result, raiders from the west had horses and steel-topped weapons, while those from the east were armed with guns. The raids and diseases that Europeans brought to the continent destroyed Quivira around 1700. Blakeslee’s findings — which he will present at the annual Society for American Archaeology meeting March 30-April 2 — focus on three types of evidence discovered about Etzanoa and Quivira: the documentary evidence, the linguistic evidence and the archaeological evidence. Blakeslee estimates the population of Quivira to have been roughly 200,000, a number that recontextualizes the scale of who occupied the Great Plains. This number is extrapolated from the eyewitness accounts of Etzanoa having a population of 17,000 to over 20,000 people and the presence of 10 or more large towns elsewhere in Quivira. The town of Etzanoa was originally listed as 22 separate sites until Blakeslee matched the eyewitness accounts to both the archaeological record and to the modern-day landscape. The other large towns discovered are still recorded as clusters of villages rather than large towns. When recorded more accurately as a connected society of large towns rather than unrelated villages, Blakeslee says, it’s clear that Quivira was much more organized and far-reaching than anyone had previously thought. The Quiviran people also had hereditary chiefs, priests, interpreters and ambassadors they would send to neighboring nations. “They were an organized society, one far different from the Hollywood version,” Blakeslee said. “But they have not been given any recognition at all in American history books.” Evidence in documents from the earliest expeditions to the southwest of the continent shows that some people in Quivira could speak Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec empire. Additionally, Blakeslee has accumulated evidence showing that Nahuatl was the basis for a Lingua Franca, a shared language between speakers of differing native languages, that was in use from Galveston Island in Texas to California, and from Kansas deep into Mexico in pre-historic times. It is the first clear documentation of a pre-historic native Lingua Franca in North America. Cabeza de Vaca, who was shipwrecked on Galveston Island and later walked to Mexico, was the first European to mention the Lingua Franca. In one passage, he mentioned people who used it would say “xo” (pronounced “show”) to call a dog, and “arraca” to get the attention of a person. Blakeslee, through a chance encounter during a Day of the Dead celebration in his neighborhood, met an individual from Guadalajara who confirmed the words to be Nahuatl, and even corrected the meaning of “arraca” to mean “welcome” instead. “Here was the clincher,” Blakeslee said. “Two words that are still in use that fit the context.” The land area of Quivira was at least as large as the Republic of Ireland, with the currently documented borders being from the Kansas River in the north; the town of Larned, Kansas in the west; east into Missouri; and south into Oklahoma. Documents from the DeSoto expedition of 1539-1542 indicate large quantities of Quiviran bison products as far east as Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, including meat, robes and war gear such as rawhide shields, helmets and body armor that filled a room in a town in South Carolina. At the same time, other expeditions documented bison rawhide shields in use on the west coast of Mexico and along the Colorado River between Arizona and California. Tobacco pipes made by Quivirans have been found in sites created by the Apache, Pawnee, Missouria and Caddo tribes and in the pueblos of Pecos and Taos. The people of Quivira received various items in return. So far, Blakeslee has documented pottery in Quiviran sites that came from North Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas. These archaeological sites have yielded the northernmost example of a type of pottery made in the vicinity of El Paso, and the southernmost example of a type made in central North Dakota. The items that traveled the farthest are pieces of obsidian from central Mexico and Jalisco, far down the west coast. So far, Quiviran sites have yielded more of the central Mexican obsidian than all of the rest of the archaeological sites in the United States. Wichita State students working on this research with Blakeslee are receiving a hands-on learning experience they’ll likely never forget. Kait Carter is a WSU graduate student majoring in anthropology who has found a passion in uncovering and illuminating the history of the site. “There’s so much knowledge out there that could be acquired, and just reconstructing history is extremely interesting,” Carter said. “I wish a lot more people were in the field to try and help.” Brogan Gillmore, a graduate student majoring in anthropology with a focus on public archaeology, is equally as excited to share the discoveries being made in the Great Plains. “The work we are doing here at WSU is really phenomenal,” Gillmore said. “We’re seeing a lot of amazing stuff. It blows your mind.” Wichita State University is Kansas' only urban public research university, enrolling almost 22,000 students between its main campus and WSU Tech, including students from every state in the U.S. and more than 100 countries.

Anthony Weiner Resists Democratic Leadership's Call for Resignation, Steps into a Leave of Absence\n\nIn a surprising turn of events on Saturday, Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner steadfastly defied his party's leaders, both privately and publicly, as they urged him to resign in the aftermath of a personal scandal that has rocked Washington. Despite mounting pressure from within the Democratic fold, Weiner decided to take a leave of absence rather than acquiesce to the wishes of his colleagues.\n\nThe embattled congressman, known for his colorful political career, found himself at the center of a media firestorm after a series of compromising messages emerged, raising questions about his judgment and suitability for office. Democratic leaders, recognizing the distraction his situation was causing to the party's agenda, exerted considerable influence, hoping to minimize the collateral damage to the Democratic brand.\n\nHowever, Weiner, undeterred by the chorus of disapproval from prominent figures such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and several prominent committee chairs, remained resolute. A statement released Saturday evening stated, \"I have decided to take a temporary leave of absence from my duties to focus on my family and my own well-being during this challenging time. I believe this is the best course of action for my constituents and my party.\"\n\nThis decision to maintain his elected position while stepping away from day-to-day responsibilities has sparked a mix of reactions within the Democratic Party. Some see it as an attempt to salvage his political career, while others view it as a necessary break for personal growth and healing. Critics argue that the ongoing scandal could prove detrimental to the party's legislative efforts and could potentially harm Weiner's ability to effectively represent his constituents.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee has already launched an investigation into the matter, further complicating the situation. Should Weiner's actions transgress ethical boundaries, additional consequences could await him upon his return. As it stands, his colleagues will have to navigate the delicate balance of supporting their constituents' voice and ensuring the integrity of their legislative body.\n\nWeiner's supporters, on the other hand, argue that he deserves a chance at redemption, acknowledging that personal flaws do not equate to disqualification from public service. They argue that the public should allow him to address the situation and return to his duties if he demonstrates the necessary contrition and commitment to serving the people of his district.\n\nAs the dust settles on this unprecedented turn of events, one thing is certain: Rep. Anthony Weiner's decision to reject calls for resignation has set a precedent that will be closely watched by both his colleagues and the public.

WASHINGTON – The second-ranking House Democrat on Sunday joined the party leadership in urging Rep. Anthony Weiner to quit because of his sexting scandal, a request the New York lawmaker has sidestepped in favor of a temporary leave of absence. The Republican Party chairman criticized Democratic leaders for not taking a more forceful stand earlier on the affair, which has overshadowed much of the legislative business on Capitol Hill over the past week. Weiner has acknowledged exchanging messages and photos, ranging from sexually suggestive to explicit, with several women online. The latest to surface appeared on the gossip website TMZ. The photos posted Sunday were purportedly taken in the House members' gym and show a shirtless Weiner with a towel around his waist and his hand on his crotch. In one photo he is naked and holding the towel over his crotch. TMZ said the photos were sent online to at least one woman. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, spoke of Weiner's \"bizarre and unacceptable behavior\" in sending inappropriate pictures of himself to young women. Hoyer said it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for Weiner to continue to represent his constituents effectively. In New York, foes and supporters of Weiner confronted each other. \"He's not fit to be our congressman,\" said Jim Scott, 61, one of about two dozen constituents who rallied in front of Weiner's office in the Kew Gardens section of Queens. \"People are sick of him, especially his attitude.\" Half a dozen Weiner supporters gathered a few yards away. College student Olivia Lurrie, 18, said Weiner was a good leader who made a mistake. Weiner announced Saturday that he was entering professional treatment at an undisclosed location and wanted a leave of absence from Congress. A statement from an aide did not say where he would receive treatment or what type was involved. That announcement came right after House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the national party head, said Weiner must go. Weiner said at news conference last Monday that he had lied in previously saying that he had not sent any photos. Pelosi immediately called for an ethics committee investigation. But it was not until the weekend that leaders said he should step down. Hoyer said the ethics committee process to decide if Weiner had committed an expellable offense would take time and \"I really don't know if we have that time.\" He said he didn't see how Weiner could stay in office. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Weiner should resign. \"We've got important work to do and this is a ridiculous distraction,\" he said in an appearance with Hoyer on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS. Lawmakers marching Sunday in New York's Puerto Rican Day parade were less demanding. \"I think it could have been handled better,\" Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said when asked whether he stood with Pelosi in calling for Weiner's resignation. Rangel, who was censured by the House last year for ethics violations, was also asked if he thought it was a good idea for Weiner to take time off to enter treatment. \"He is the one that knows the best, he and his wife,\" Rangel responded. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., declined to comment any further, saying, \"Those of us who have been longtime friends of Anthony are heartbroken, and I'm just going to try to enjoy the parade today.\" On NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus criticized Pelosi and other Democrats for not acting sooner. \"It seemed to me that for the first 10 days in this circus ... the only job that Nancy Pelosi was interested in saving was Anthony Weiner's,\" he said. That drew a sharp retort from Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who accused Republicans of a double standard. She said that Republican leaders didn't call for the resignation of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., when he got caught up in a prostitution scandal, and that Priebus had not publicly sought the resignation of former Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., who stepped down this year over an affair with a staffer's wife. Wasserman Schultz said party officials initially gave Weiner \"some breathing room\" to reach the conclusion that he needed to step down on his own, but decided to toughen their stance Saturday after it became apparent he would not do so. David B. Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Akron, said Sunday: \"Had Anthony Weiner not been a rising star in the party and such a hero to progressives, he would have already been gone. But the fact that he is a national figure that has a national base of support bought him some time.\" A leave of absence may be Weiner's only chance to rehabilitate his career, Cohen said. \"Remorse isn't going to cut it in this case. Buy some time, and some time out of the public spotlight.\" Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

In light of Anthony Weiner’s offensive behavior ... he should resign,” Schwartz said. But Howard Witz, a real estate broker in Brooklyn, part of Weiner’s district in New York City, said he would support Weiner again should he stay in politics. “It’s a shame because he’s a very effective politician,” Witz said. “Disappointed? Maybe. But does it make me quit on him? No it doesn’t. As long as he didn’t commit a crime.” Another New Yorker, Joe Mele, was blunter in talking about Weiner, who has voiced ambitions to run for mayor of New York in 2013. “Mayor? I don’t think he should be dogcatcher,” Mele said. Weiner, married to a longtime aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, acknowledged on Monday he had inappropriate Internet and telephone conversations with six women. But the 46-year-old lawmaker said he had broken no law and would not resign. [ID:nN06169942] Dan Ripp of Bradley Woods, a private firm that tracks Washington for investors, said he expected Weiner to quit within days. “I think he’s history,” Ripp said. “Democrats aren’t giving him the time of day. He has no clout. His own party is looking at him like a bozo. He is dragging them down.” A little more than half of New York City voters think Weiner should remain in office, according to a NY1-Marist poll taken just hours after his tearful admission. But a majority, 56 percent, say he should give up his hopes of becoming the next New York mayor. Actor Alec Baldwin, long thought to be considering a political career, may jump into the race. “I wouldn’t rule it out,” his publicist Matthew Hiltzik said, responding to a report in The Daily online publication, which reported that the star of television’s “30 Rock” believed the Weiner scandal had improved his chances to become mayor. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has asked the House Ethics Committee to investigate whether Weiner violated any of the chamber’s rules. House Republican Leader Eric Cantor on Tuesday became the first top U.S. lawmaker to say Weiner should step down, saying Congress was too busy with other matters to deal with Weiner’s tweets. Former Democratic Party Chairman Tim Kaine, now running for the Senate from Virginia, also called on Weiner to step down. “Lying is unforgivable, public lying about something like this is unforgivable. He should resign,” Kaine told a television station on Tuesday in Charlottesville, Virginia.

See here for a complete list of exchanges and delays.", "Barack Obama has piled further pressure on disgraced Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner, who has to date resisted calls to step down from Congress, by describing Weiner's behaviour as \"highly inappropriate\" and saying: \"I can tell you that if it was me, I would resign.\" Obama's remarks, in an interview with NBC's Today show on Tuesday, makes the president the highest ranking Democrat to suggest that Weiner leave politics, as further photographs sent by Weiner to women emerged and Democratic leaders in Congress called on him to go. Obama's comments were his first remarks on the lurid scandal, in which Weiner first denied and later admitted exchanging lewd photographs and online messages with several women he had met through social media. \"I think he's embarrassed himself. He's acknowledged that. He's embarrassed his wife and his family. Ultimately, there's gonna be a decision for him and his constituents. I can tell you that, if it was me, I would resign,\" Obama said in the interview. \"When you get to the point where, because of various personal distractions, you can't serve as effectively as you need to at the time when people are worrying about jobs, and their mortgages, and paying the bills, then you should probably step back.\" On Monday the House of Representatives unanimously granted Weiner's request for a two week leave of absence. Before Obama's comments, other senior Democrats had called on Weiner to quit over the weekend, including the Democratic leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, and the influential chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Steve Israel, who called Weiner's scandal \"an insurmountable distraction\". So far Weiner has maintained that he will stay in office, and there is little the Democratic heirarchy can do to force him out, other than strip him of his spot of the House's powerful energy and commerce committee. Republicans in Congress have been pressing the Democratic leadership to expel Weiner, but Pelosi said in a statement: \"None of us, not anybody here, has the power to force somebody out of office. That person has to decide himself as to whether he will stay or he will go.\" Weiner has said that he would not resign without talking to his wife, Huma Abedin, herself an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Abedin is expected to return from a trip overseas on Tuesday.", "Ethics Watchdog on Weiner Resignation Calls: 'Massive Overreaction' June 8, 2011— -- A growing number of Democrats are joining several high-profile Republicans in calling for Rep. Anthony Weiner of New York to resign following his admission of risqué online exchanges and lying about them. Pennsylvania Rep. Allyson Schwartz, a top Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee official, called Weiner's behavior \"offensive\" and said that he should resign. \"Having the respect of your constituents is fundamental for a member of Congress,\" she said in an interview with Politico. Schwartz joins a handful of other sitting Democrats, including Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Patrick Leahy of Vermont, and former DNC chairman Tim Kaine in calling for Weiner to step down. Top Republicans, including RNC chairman Reince Preibus and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, have also said Weiner should go. But some observers say the message to Weiner is hypocritical and politically motivated, given both public opinion polling showing that a majority of New Yorkers think Weiner should stay and the fact that Weiner has not been accused of breaking the law or convicted of violating any House rules. \"This is a massive overreaction and I don't understand it,\" said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Sloan pointed to the recent ethics case of another New York congressman, Charles Rangel, as an example of the double standard being pushed by some Democrats for Weiner. The House Ethics Committee found Rangel -- the former chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, which writes the nation's tax laws -- guilty of improper fundraising, inappropriate possession of multiple rent-controlled apartments and failure to pay taxes on a vacation home, among other charges. \"There were very few calls on Rangel to resign and he was censured of serious misconduct involving his office – really serious things that had potential for criminal charges,\" Sloan said. \"We don't have anything remotely like that in the Weiner case.\" Sloan explained that the mounting pressure on Weiner may stem in part from the early precedent set by House Speaker John Boehner when, at the first sign of sexual misconduct, he urged Reps. Mark Souder (R-Ind.) and Chris Lee (R-N.Y.) to resign, even though their behavior didn't appear to involve any abuse of their office. \"A lot of people really hate Weiner, too,\" she said, referring to Weiner's colleagues in the House, some of whom are said to have been rankled by his personality and frequent media appearances. As for Weiner's bald lies to his family, constituents and the general public in media appearances last week about the lewd photo that appeared on Twitter, Sloan said it was disconcerting and tarnished his credibility but not the worst Washington has seen. \"A politician lying is not that unusual,\" Sloan said. \"If the new standard is that politicians are out the second they lie to us, then a lot of politicians could be gone.\" The Senate Ethics Committee last month concluded that Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) tried to cover up a sex scandal with the wife of his former top aide, made false statements to the Federal Election Commission, and violated campaign finance laws. Ensign, who remained in office during the monthslong investigation, abruptly resigned before the findings were released. The committee later referred the case to both the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events", "This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2023 FOX News Network, LLC.

'Special Report' All-Star panel weighs in Anthony Weiner shrugged off calls Wednesday to withdraw from the New York City mayoral race over a new sexting scandal, despite criticism from old colleagues, media calls for him to step down and newly released poll figures that gave him a moral character rating of 17 percent. Weiner told reporters Wednesday night that while the uproar of recent days had \"been rough,\" he felt \"these are things I brought upon myself.\" He added he was \"pressing forward.\" The ex-congressman was greeted with boos as he took the stage at a public housing meeting earlier Wednesday evening, the Associated Press reported.. But by the end of his remarks, the crowd loudly cheered. Even former Democratic congressional colleagues said enough is enough. Rep. Jerrold Nadler said Wednesday: \"I think he should pull out of the race. I think he needs serious psychiatric help.\" Rep. Joseph Crowley said New Yorkers are \"tired of the drama\" surrounding Weiner. And Rep. Charles Rangel said he believes the voters will put an end to Weiner's ambitions. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday afternoon that surveyed likely New York City Democratic voters from July 18-23 -- news of Weiner's latest indiscretions broke on the last day -- gave him a 17 percent score for moral character, 57 percent for experience and 51 percent for understanding. It also put him in first place, with 26 percent of the vote, in the first round of the Democratic primary but in the event of a runoff, the poll says he would finish behind former city comptroller William Thompson. The New York Post Wednesday reported Weiner had released an \"open letter\" in which he said sending the lewd texts and photos were \"a terrible mistake that I unfortunately returned to during a rough time\" in his marriage to wife Huma Abedin. Weiner Tuesday admitted sending a woman sexually explicit photos and messages and acknowledged the activity took place as recently as last summer, more than a year after he resigned from the House in June 2011 for the same sort of behavior with at least a half-dozen women. With Abedin standing an arm's length away from him, Weiner told a hastily called news conference he would stay in the race despite the new onslaught of negative publicity. \"I want to bring my vision to the people of the city of New York. I hope they are willing to still continue to give me a second chance,\" Weiner said. In an editorial posted online Tuesday, the New York Times urged Weiner to drop out of the race, saying Weiner \"should take his marital troubles and personal compulsions out of the public eye, away from cameras, off the Web and out of the race for mayor of New York City.\" Three of his rivals for mayor — Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and former City Councilman Sal Albanese, both Democrats, and billionaire John Catsimatidis, a Republican — also called on Weiner to quit the race. \"Enough is enough,\" de Blasio said. \"The sideshows of this election have gotten in the way of the debate we should be having about the future of this city.\" Another mayoral hopeful, city Comptroller John Liu, stopped short of calling for Weiner to bow out, but suggested his \"propensity for pornographic selfies is a valid issue for voters.\" The other leading Democratic candidates, including City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Thompson, did not immediately comment. The congressman fessed up to the naughty texts after sexually explicit photos and online chats between \"Carlos Danger,\" allegedly the pseudonym for the city hall hopeful, and an unidentified woman surfaced on the blog, TheDirty.com. The reports claim that that the conversation between the pol and an unidentified 23-year-old woman took place on the social media website Formspring in August 2012, a year after he resigned from his post in Congress after being caught the first time — and nearly seven months after his first child with wife Abedin was born. The woman claims on the blog that she first started talking online with Weiner in July 2012 and it became intense by August 2012, when he offered to find a Chicago condo where they could meet up. She also alleges that they had phone sex and that they exchanged nude photos of each other. She claims she received photos from Weiner of his penis sent from a Yahoo email account under the “Carlos Danger” name. The purported image was subsequently posted on TheDirty.com. Buzzfeed.com later reported that a source close to the matter said Weiner exchanged the explicit messages and photos with a woman named Sydney Elaine Leathers in late July of last year. The website characterized Leathers as a \"progressive activist\" from Indiana. Weiner released a written statement on Tuesday afternoon, which he read again at the press conference, admitting to additional raunchy conversations. \"I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out, and today they have,” he said in the statement, referring to comments he made two months ago during the start of his mayoral campaign. “As I have said in the past, these things that I did were wrong and hurtful to my wife and caused us to go through challenges in our marriage that extended past my resignation from Congress. While some things that have been posted today are true and some are not, there is no question that what I did was wrong. This behavior is behind me.” Weiner did not elaborate on which of the new reports are true or false and whether or not it took place last summer. It's unclear how the lewd news will impact Weiner's campaign. Some New Yorkers have shown a willingness to forgive his past indiscretions since he announced his mayoral campaign via YouTube in May. He has since shot to the lead in the polls, with a Quinnipiac University survey last week showing he held 25 percent of the vote.

The latest legal battle centers around a recently appointed executive, who has accused the company of fostering a hostile work environment that disproportionately targeted women during her brief tenure.\n\nThe executive, whose identity has been protected under privacy laws, was brought on board to Magic Leap with the express aim of boosting the company's efforts to diversify and appeal to a wider audience, particularly women. However, her experience at the AR pioneer suggests that the very goals she was hired to achieve were being undermined by a deep-seated culture of discrimination.\n\nAccording to court documents, the executive alleges that she faced unwelcome advances, gender-based slurs, and a systematic lack of support from male colleagues. The lawsuit further details a pattern of behavior that was not only uncomfortable but also detrimental to the professional growth of female employees within the company.\n\nSources close to the case indicate that Magic Leap, known for its groundbreaking AR technology, had been working on initiatives to attract and retain more women, including programs focused on mentorship and female-friendly work environments. However, the lawsuit questions whether the company's efforts were mere tokenism, failing to translate into meaningful change for the women working behind the scenes.\n\nThe lawsuit comes at a crucial time for Magic Leap, which has been on the cusp of releasing its long-awaited consumer product and has been seeking to position itself as a leader in the rapidly growing AR industry. The allegations have not only tarnished the company's image but also raised questions about the depth and sincerity of its commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, Magic Leap issued a statement acknowledging the严肃 nature of the accusations and expressing its commitment to creating a safe and equitable workplace. The company pledged to fully investigate the claims, cooperate with the legal process, and take any necessary steps to address and rectify the alleged issues.\n\nIndustry experts are closely watching this case, as it could set a precedent for how tech companies are held accountable for fostering inclusive environments, particularly in the highly competitive field of AR. The outcome of this lawsuit will not only impact Magic Leap but will likely serve as a reminder to other tech giants to reevaluate and strengthen their own efforts to prevent discrimination and promote diversity.\n\nAs the legal proceedings unfold, Magic Leap has an opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to change, not just through words but through concrete actions that address the concerns raised by this高管's experience.

Not a great run of publicity, particularly when the startup is due to present its tech to board members this week, according to reports in Business Insider. Tannen Campbell, Magic Leap’sformer VP of strategic marketing and brand identity, alleges that a hostile work environment was created by a series of incidents listed in the suit, including an IT support lead telling a group during a tutorial that women have trouble with computers and: “In IT we have a saying; stay away from the Three Os: Orientals, Old People and Ovaries.” The suit alleges, “Magic Leap was run by Abovitz sycophants”, “Magic Leap tolerated sexist comments and attitudes,” and “Magic Leap kept women in their place”, with each statement backed up with a list of examples. Read more: Inside Magic Leap, the startup creating a new type of reality Incredibly, Campbell was brought on board to help tackle a gender diversity problem at the startup, famously valued at $4.5 billion despite the product still being in development. Campbell claims a presentation she was asked to put together on the issue was cancelled multiple times, and when it finally took place after seven months, CEO Rony Abovitz walked out halfway through. She was also part of a “female brain trust initiative” where ideas were floated for making the device and the company more female-friendly. According to the suit, the only solution the engineers at Magic Leap could come up with to tackle the issue prior to Campbell’s hiring, was to produce a pink prototype of the device. However after one “chaotic” meeting no proposed changes were implemented, and no male executives attended the group again. By Matt Kamen By WIRED By Matt Kamen By WIRED The suit refers to the environment as one of “macho bullying”, and claims that Magic Leap is losing “competitive advantage to products like Microsoft’s Hololens”, because it fails to hire women. “Microsoft, which employs far more females on its team, developed its similar product on a faster timeline with more content that appeals to both genders.” Magic Leap, by comparison, continues to delay the launch, the suit says. It ultimately alleges Campbell was fired because she: “challenged Magic Leap’s CEO, Rony Abovitz, to acknowledge the depths of misogyny in Magic Leap’s culture and take steps to correct a gender imbalance that negatively affects the company’s core culture and renders it so dysfunctional it continues to delay the launch of a product that attracted billions of investment dollars.” Although CEO Abovitz cleared up last week’s leaked photo shortly after it was released - claiming on Twitter: “The photo shows a @magicleap R&D test rig where we collect room/space data for our machine vision/machine learning work” - Campbell’s suit now attacks the very promise of Magic Leap. Incredible and hyperreal images of whales floating over crowds and elephants cupped in the palm of the hand have become ubiquitous with the AR headset and its potential. But the suit alleges: “Campbell raised concerns that what Magic Leap showed the public in marketing material was not what the product actually could do - admonitions ignored in favor of her male colleagues’ assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap’s website and on YouTube were ‘aspirational,’ and not Magic Leap’s version of ‘alternate facts’.\" The marketing material is designed to show off its potential, to garner attention and investment, which it did, in spades. The startup has raised $1.39 billion dollars and backers include Andreessen Horowitz, Google, JPMorgan and Alibaba. But with an increasingly critical eye on the unicorn, particularly after a December report by the Information that claimed the device may not be able to be miniaturised enough, the suit will come as a blow.

Further, the suit claims Magic Leap ignored Campbell's concerns about distributing false marketing materials. Magic Leap did not respond to CNNTech's request for comment. The suit alleges Campbell was hired to address Magic Leap's \"pink/blue problem,\" or the internal idea that the product did not appeal to women. It also claims executives repeatedly ignored her attempts to present information to help solve gender imbalance within the company. Magic Leap does not say it's an \"equal opportunity employer\" on its website where it lists \"Wizards Wanted,\" the suit says. The suit goes in depth about the gender norms of wizards. \"Given that a 'wizard' generally is defined as 'a man who has magical powers,' and virtually without exception images of wizards are male, Magic Leap's recruiting verbiage contains a not-so-subtle 'women-need-not-apply' message,\" according to the suit. The lawsuit also lists numerous incidents of sexist behavior from executives and employees. Despite considerable attention from the tech press and a $4.5 billion valuation, Magic Leap, founded in 2011, has not released a product for public consumption. The company has, however, distributed videos of what it says its mixed reality headset will be able to do -- overlay images and video on the real world. According to a December report from The Information, marketing videos were designed by special effects companies. The lawsuit claims Campbell's male colleagues said \"the images and videos presented on Magic Leap's website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap's version of 'alternate facts.'\" Last week, Business Insider published a photo of what it claims is Magic Leap's prototype -- a large bulky wearable strapped to a man's back and hooked up to AR goggles.

The suit also alleges that the hostile work environment has lead to dysfunction, causing the Plantation, Fla.-headquartered company to miss deadlines. Tannen Campbell filed the suit earlier this week in U.S. District Court in the southern district of Florida. Campbell says that CEO Rony Abovitz hired her in April 2015 as head of strategic marketing and brand identity to help improve gender diversity at Magic Leap and make its in-development augmented reality product more female-friendly. Magic Leap is a much-buzzed about tech firm that has raised $1.4 billion in funding, with lead investors such as Alibaba, Google and Qualcomm. In June 2016, Magic Leap announced a new partnership with Lucasfilm, focusing on AR games based on the studio's franchises such as Star Wars. Magic Leap did not return request for comment on the case. In her first few months on the job, Campbell said she prepared a presentation on the company's gender problem — noting that no women were in leadership position at the company and only 14% of employees were women — and offering solutions including recruiting employees from colleges with strong female STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) departments. At the July 2015 meeting when Campbell made her presentation, Abovitz arrived late and ended the meeting before she finished, she says in the suit. After three subsequent attempts to meet with Abovitz to show him the rest of the presentation, she \"got the message and gave up,\" she says. Campbell was then enlisted as part of a subsequent “female brain trust initiative,” to provide design changes to Magic Leap's headset meant to make the product better appeal to women, she says. Among suggestions: a new way to attach the \"belt pack\" since women rarely wear belts. \"The group made no decisions and none of the proposed changes were made to the design,\" she alleges. \"It was window dressing.\" Magic Leap tolerated sexist comments and attitudes in the workplace, she alleges. As an example, she cited the misogynistic nature of one of the apps expected to ship with the headset, a “Dr. G.,” game with no female lead characters, but one in the game's back story, \"a busty woman depicted on her knees\" groveling at the hero's feet. Women in technology have feared that the burgeoning virtual reality and AR development areas might grow to be as male-dominated at the video game development and the overall tech industry. In her job interview, Campbell says that Magic Leap CEO Abovitz, told her \"he wanted his company to be different, and asked (her) if she could help with that.\" However, Campbell alleges, the corporate atmosphere \"literally, prevented (her) from doing the job she was hired to do or achieving the goals she and Abovitz had discussed during her initial interview: helping with the 'pink/blue problem' or making Magic Leap less of a 'boys club'.” Campbell said she also voiced concerns that images and videos used in Magic Leap's marketing material \"was not what the product actually could do.\" However, her concerns were \"ignored in favor of her male colleagues’ assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap’s website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap’s version of 'alternate facts',\" alleges Campbell, who says she was told in December her job was being eliminated and she was terminated. Campbell says she refused three months' severance for an agreement to release any claims she would have against Magic Leap. She filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Dec. 21, 2016, her suit says. Beyond gender discrimination, the suit alleges core problems with the company's culture hinder its ability to compete with rivals in the burgeoning AR space. \"The macho bullying atmosphere at Magic Leap fosters a dysfunctional culture which creates chaos and lack of process and structure (and) hinders the company from achieving key product deadlines,\" she says in the suit. The company moved back its product launch date \"at least 4 times\" during her 1.5 years there, she says. Several media reports in recent months have raised questions about the tech company's progress towards a consumer product. In a December 2016 interview with Magic Leap chief marketing officer Brenda Freeman, Recode senior editor Peter Kafka cited an investor's concern about Magic Leap's ability to create a product. \"We are racing toward launch and we’re meeting our goals,\" she told him. Business Insider last week reported that Magic Leap's engineers were \"scrambling\" to finish a working prototype of its glasses for this week's board meeting. Over the weekend, Abovitz took to Twitter to clarify that a leaked photo of Magic Leap's hardware, published by Business Insider, was a test rig. \"The photo you are all excited about is NOT what you think it is,\" he said in a series of tweets. To all of Magic Leap's fans, he promised: \"We will not let you down. \" More: Why virtual reality gaming needs women developers VR, AR will be very real in 2017 Magic Leap partners with Lucasfilm on AR vision Follow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.", "Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Pinterest has agreed to settle a gender discrimination and retaliation lawsuit brought by its former chief operating officer, Francoise Brougher, for $22.5 million. The settlement, announced on Monday, includes a $2.5 million investment “to be used towards advancing women and underrepresented communities in the tech industry,” Brougher and the company said in a joint statement. Pinterest did not admit to liability as part of the settlement, a company spokesperson confirmed. “Pinterest recognizes the importance of fostering a workplace environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive and will continue its actions to improve its culture,” the statement said. “Francoise welcomes the meaningful steps Pinterest has taken to improve its workplace environment and is encouraged that Pinterest is committed to building a culture that allows all employees to feel included and supported.” News of the settlement was first reported by the New York Times. The settlement brings to an end one of the most high-profile gender discrimination cases in Silicon Valley in recent memory. Brougher’s lawsuit, as well as allegations of racism and discrimination from two other former Pinterest employees in June, rattled the staff of the digital scrapbooking service, which is known for being a feel-good online destination. Pinterest told CNN Business at the time that it had conducted an investigation and found that the two employees were “treated fairly.” Pinterest is this year's best social media stock Brougher sued Pinterest in August. The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, alleged that Pinterest “brazenly fired” Brougher after she complained about gender bias. “Whereas male executives were rewarded for strong leadership styles, Ms. Brougher was criticized for not being compliant or collaborative enough,” the lawsuit said. “In addition, Ms. Brougher was offered a less favorable compensation structure than her male peers and had to fight for equal treatment.” In her complaint, Brougher said she was fired over a video call by Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann after complaining to him and the head of human resources that the company’s chief financial officer, Todd Morgenfeld, made “demeaning sexist comments” toward her. She also alleged that Pinterest tried to “create a fiction” that her April 2020 departure was voluntary. When asked on Monday for comment from Silbermann and Morgenfeld, who are not defendants in the lawsuit, Pinterest declined to comment beyond the joint statement with Brougher. Pinterest hires lawyers to examine its workplace culture after accusations of racism A Pinterest spokeswoman told the Times in August that the company was reviewing the case, and was committed to ensuring “all of our employees feel included and supported.” The company subsequently denied Brougher’s accusations in a court filing in September. Brougher said in a tweet on Monday that she “will continue to advocate for workplace equity, including more women in the C-Suite.” In June, the company hired an outside legal team to examine its workplace culture in response to accusations of racism and discrimination by two former Black employees. In a statement at the time, Silbermann said the law firm would review how Pinterest “evaluates, promotes, and compensates employees and how the company responds to and investigates complaints of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.", "SAN FRANCISCO — When former Uber engineer Susan Fowler went public with sexual harassment and discrimination allegations last month, social media erupted with shock and dismay. But many women were far from surprised. Silicon Valley's dirty little secret: women throughout the male-dominated tech sector have stories just like hers. Stories of harassment, lesser pay and stalled careers. Stories of management turning a blind eye. \"This is at all tech companies,\" says Ellen Pao, who unsuccessfully sued venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for sexual discrimination. \"It may not be as bad as this (Uber), but this is the culture of tech.\" WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH:What do men get that women don't? Here are a few things And, since Fowler went public with her charges, more women are now hiring lawyers, according to Pao. \"It will be interesting to see how the companies respond,\" she said. For the tech industry, gender inequity has proven to be a hard problem to solve. Employment lawyers say women from Silicon Valley and the tech industry have been walking through their doors for years with sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. These cases show no signs of letting up. And they are not just complaints against start-up companies with young managers and loose policies. Among companies that have faced lawsuits from women over their treatment are Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter. Blogging ex-Uber employee retains lawyer Attorney Kelly Dermody, head of the employment practice at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, which is representing women suing Microsoft for gender discrimination, says she gets calls every single week from women in the tech industry. \"It's not abating,\" says David Lowe, partner with Rudy, Exelrod, Zieff & Lowe, whose firm represented Pao. \"You would think by now that these sorts of harassment issues would not come up as often, that people would be more knowledgeable, more sensitive, more trained. But the publicity from these cases has not made a dent in the number of cases we have seen.\" Six out of 10 women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances, according to the Elephant in the Valley survey of more than 200 women released last year. About two-thirds of these women said these advances were from a superior, and some 66% said they felt excluded in tech because of their gender. Uber sexism charges sound wake-up call for Silicon Valley And those statistics have names and faces. In 2014, Tinder and its parent IAC/InterActiveCorp settled a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Whitney Wolfe. An early female employee of the dating app, Wolfe alleged the company co-founders subjected her \"to a barrage of horrendously sexist, racist and otherwise inappropriate comments\" and stripped her of a co-founder title because she was a \"young female.\" Three women are alleging gender discrimination at Microsoft, claiming the tech giant's performance evaluation, pay and promotion practices discriminate against women in technical and engineering roles. Microsoft says it disputes the claims. Tannen Campbell, a former female executive at Magic Leap who says she was hired to make the augmented reality startup \"less of a boys club,\" sued the company in February for sex discrimination. Magic Leap sued for sex discrimination by woman hired to increase diversity And last fall, A.J. Vandermeyden sued Tesla for sexual discrimination, alleging she was paid less than men for doing the same work and was subjected to harassing behavior such as catcalls in a work environment dominated by men. Elon Musk's electric car company disputes the charges, saying its investigation found no evidence of harassment and discrimination Vandermeyden's attorney, Therese Lawless of Lawless & Lawless, says Vandermeyden tried to change things inside the company but couldn't. \"So she decided to do it from the outside,\" Lawless said. “Until (a company) realizes they have a problem, nothing is going to change,\" said Lawless, who also represented Pao. \"A fish rots from the head down is the old cliché. Leadership has to say: We have a problem and this is how we’re going to handle it, or there will be more women coming out.” Pao says Silicon Valley has to stop shooting the messengers. The jury found Kleiner Perkins did not discriminate against Pao but her case brought national attention to the challenges women face in the tech industry and in Silicon Valley in particular. \"I hope that instead people start listening,\" said Pao, who's now chief diversity and inclusion officer for Kapor Center for Social Impact and a venture partner at Kapor Capital. \"And whether that's HR, whether that's the manager, whether that's the press, whether that's the general public, everybody should be paying attention to these stories and to these experiences and thinking about: How do we prevent them?\" Complaints not likely to stop Gender inequality is an issue technology companies would do well to address quickly, if not simply for moral reasons than financial. Women use the latest apps and gadgets in equal, if not greater, numbers. And they outnumber men at the top schools and in the workforce. But they are in noticeably short supply in Silicon Valley. Critics say tech giants have not built a workforce that reflects available talent, whether among women or people of color, particularly in engineering and leadership roles that are disproportionately held by white men. Uber's Kalanick faces crisis over 'baller' culture Seven out of 10 workers at major tech companies such as Google and Facebook are men. Women comprise 20% or less of technical staff. Few women reach the senior executive level or the boardroom. And they don't fare much better as entrepreneurs. A sliver of venture capital funding goes to women and a small percentage of venture capital investors are women. Studies warn that tech's gender gap is only widening as women are being held back by stereotypes, biases and work environments that make them feel marginalized, unwelcome or even threatened. Fowler's Uber saga — which she titled \"Reflecting on one very, very strange year at Uber\" — bears that out, featuring stories of being sexually propositioned by her boss on her first day of work; of being told by HR that her complaints would go nowhere because her boss was a prized employee; of being left with choices that included putting up with his advances and accepting a bad evaluation or moving departments. On Thursday, she tweeted that she had hired an attorney. Silicon Valley gender gap is widening But most stories of misconduct in tech are never shared publicly. Women, especially those early in their careers, fear fallout from being known as the next Ellen Pao, who endured having her life scrutinized for three years during her legal case. Instead they quietly change jobs to flee harassment and discrimination, or they negotiate confidential settlements. Lawless says employees do not file lawsuits lightly. “Most individuals, men or women, really want to work out these things internally, with their managers or with human resources,” she said. “In my experience it isn’t until it is so bad, when they’re terminated or they quit, that it gets escalated.” A disruptive but often toxic culture Lowe says he's not a psychiatrist, but suspects the root causes of these toxic work environments include inexperienced and often youthful management, a rule-breaking ethos, a sense of entitlement, and too little respect for boundaries. For example, back in 2014, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, now 26, apologized for sexually graphic emails he sent as a Stanford University student in which he talked about making 300 Jell-O shots to get sorority girls drunk and urinating on one woman. \"Any company that grows explosively is at risk of running afoul of worker protection laws because it may neglect to put necessary compliance policies and practices into place, both as rules and as cultural realities,\" says Jahan Sagafi, a partner with Outten & Golden who represents workers in claims against employers. Sexism charges hit technology industry But change is always possible. Earlier this week, an Uber driver dashcam video surfaced showing Kalanick berating the driver. The CEO immediately sent a confessional email to his staff, calling the embarrassing video \"a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up. This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.\" \"The flourishing of discrimination in Silicon Valley is reminiscent of what we saw with the last new economy boom, in the world of high finance that really took off in the 1980s,\" Sagafi says. \"There’s a small, insular world dominated by white men who are creating a new industry and disrupting outdated ways of doing business,\" he says. \"But their justifiable pride in changing the old rules can bleed into disdain for all the rules, including society’s core protections against unfair treatment in the workplace.\" Follow USA TODAY tech reporters Jessica Guynn and Marco della Cava on Twitter."], "facts": [{"Question": "What is the title of the passage about?", "Answer": "The title of the passage is about Magic Leap facing a lawsuit regarding sexual discrimination."}, {"Question": "What is Magic Leap known for?", "Answer": "Magic Leap is known for its groundbreaking augmented reality (AR) technology."}, {"Question": "What is the latest legal battle at Magic Leap centered around?", "Answer": "The latest legal battle at Magic Leap is centered around a recently appointed executive who has accused the company of fostering a hostile work environment that disproportionately targeted women."}, {"Question": "What does the executive accuse the company of?", "Answer": "The executive accuses the company of unwelcome advances, gender-based slurs, and a lack of support from male colleagues."}, {"Question": "What efforts had Magic Leap been making to attract and retain more women?", "Answer": "Magic Leap had been working on initiatives like mentorship programs and female-friendly work environments to attract and retain more women."}, {"Question": "What impact has the lawsuit had on Magic Leap?", "Answer": "The lawsuit has tarnished the company's image and raised questions about its commitment to diversity and inclusion."}, {"Question": "How did Magic Leap respond to the lawsuit?", "Answer": "Magic Leap issued a statement acknowledging the seriousness of the accusations and expressed its commitment to creating a safe and equitable workplace."}, {"Question": "Why are industry experts closely watching this case?", "Answer": "Industry experts are closely watching this case to see how tech companies are held accountable for fostering inclusive environments, especially in the AR industry."}, {"Question": "What opportunity does Magic Leap have as the legal proceedings unfold?", "Answer": "Magic Leap has an opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to change through concrete actions that address the concerns raised by the executive's experience."}, {"Question": "What does the outcome of this lawsuit potentially impact?", "Answer": "The outcome of this lawsuit potentially impacts not only Magic Leap but also other tech giants, reminding them to reevaluate their efforts in preventing discrimination and promoting diversity."}], "extraction_tokens": 373}

A recent study has suggested that the ratio of the lengths of the index finger and the ring finger, often referred to as the 2D:4D ratio, in males may hold predictive power for a diverse array of disorders. This overlooked biological marker could revolutionize our understanding of male health and open up new avenues for early intervention and personalized medicine.\n\nThe Ratio of Interest\n\nThe 2D:4D ratio, where D represents the width of the second digit (index finger) at its base and the fourth digit (ring finger) at its base, has been extensively studied in recent years. Incredibly, this ratio seems to exhibit a distinct pattern, with males generally having a shorter index finger compared to their ring finger, while females tend to have a more equal length. Researchers have found that this small variation in finger proportions might carry significant implications for various health conditions.\n\nImplications for Male Health\n\n1. Cardiovascular Disease: Initial studies have linked lower 2D:4D ratios in males to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The ratio is inversely proportional to the levels of hormones like testosterone and estrogen, and these hormonal imbalances can contribute to the development of conditions like hypertension, heart attacks, and stroke.\n\n2. Mental Health: Research has also hinted at a connection between the 2D:4D ratio and mental health, with lower ratios possibly indicating a higher likelihood of conditions such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and even depression. These associations suggest a potential role of hormonal influences on neural development and function.\n\n3. Reproductive Health: Studies have shown that men with lower 2D:4D ratios may experience reduced sperm quality, fertility issues, and even a higher risk of testicular cancer. This connection could be an indicator of hormonal imbalances affecting male reproductive health.\n\n4. Addiction and Aggression: Some studies have explored the link between the 2D:4D ratio and behaviors associated with impulsivity and aggression, suggesting that lower ratios might contribute to a higher likelihood of substance abuse and violence, although more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nA New Frontier in Health Diagnosis\n\nThe revelation that a simple measurement of finger proportions can offer insights into multiple health conditions is intriguing. By incorporating this ratio into the diagnostic process, healthcare professionals could potentially identify individuals at risk of these disorders before symptoms manifest, allowing for early intervention and tailored preventative measures.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while these findings are compelling, more research is needed to validate these correlations and establish causality. Further studies with larger sample sizes, diverse populations, and controlled environments will be crucial in refining our understanding of this biological marker and its implications.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ratio of the index and ring finger in males may prove to be a valuable tool in predicting and understanding a variety of health disorders. As scientists continue to unravel the intricate connections between our physical traits and biological processes, this research paves the way for a more personalized, proactive approach to healthcare. By embracing this newfound knowledge, we can potentially improve disease prevention, treatment, and overall health outcomes for men.", "token_usage": 684, "human_written_evidences": ["– the length of a man ' s index and ring fingers have recently been linked from everything to promiscuity and how nice he is to women . the idea is that finger lengths change depending on exposure to testosterone in utero , and it ' s known as the \" 2d : 4d \" ratio . a lower ratio — where the second digit is shorter than the fourth — indicates \" greater androgen exposure . \" in the journal clinical anatomy , researchers write that others have previously suggested a link between androgen exposure in the womb and schizophrenia ; they take that one step further , hypothesizing the ratio could be predictive of schizophrenia in males . then they set out to test that hypothesis : in their small study , researchers analyzed the finger lengths of 103 turkish male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 healthy male controls . they found \" significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio ... in both hands , \" the researchers report in a press release . the findings occupy opposite ends of the spectrum : the right-hand 2d : 4d ratio was \" significantly higher \" among the schizophrenia group and the left-hand ratio was \" significantly lower \" — suggesting the two are opposites , perhaps because testosterone \" affects finger ratios differently as it acts in different ways on the left and right hemispheres of the brain , \" per the study . as for those ratios , the researchers found the size of the ratio in the left hand could indicate the severity of negative symptoms in patients .

Hobby Airport in Houston, Texas, casting a spotlight on the airline industry's standards for customer service and employee conduct. A pair of United Airlines employees were alleged to have subjected a passenger to a shocking display of disrespect, abuse, and even violence during a routine boarding process. The incident, which unfolded in September 2020, has since sparked public outrage and prompted the airline to reassess its policies and accountability measures.\n\nThe victim, a man named David Dao, was forcibly removed from his seat on aoverbooked United Airlines flight, after the airline offered financial compensation to find another seat for him. What transpired next was captured on camera by fellow passengers, exposing the employees' callous behavior. They were heard laughing, cursing, and repeatedly referring to Dao as \"disgusting\" and a \"problem.\" The video quickly went viral, igniting a national conversation about the treatment of customers by airline staff.\n\nAccording to eyewitness accounts, Dao sustained injuries during the altercation, including a broken nose and two chipped teeth, which had a profound impact on both his physical and emotional well-being. United Airlines faced intense scrutiny and backlash from the public, with many questioning the company's commitment to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all passengers.\n\nIn response to this incident, United Airlines initiated an internal investigation and took swift action against the employees involved. They were fired from their positions, and Dao filed a lawsuit against the airline, seeking compensation for the harm he suffered. The case served as a wake-up call for the airline industry, leading to increased scrutiny on employee training and the implementation of stricter protocols to handle overbook situations.\n\nSince then, United Airlines has introduced new policies to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents, such as offering more compensation to those voluntarily giving up their seats and providing additional support to employees in managing challenging situations. The company has also reinforced its commitment to treating every passenger with dignity and respect, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe Houston incident stands as a reminder that the customer experience goes beyond air travel and can be heavily influenced by the actions of airline employees. The incident's aftermath has led to a broader conversation about the importance of professionalism and empathy in the workplace, not just in the service industry but across all sectors.\n\nWhile the incident may have occurred almost two years ago, its echoes still reverberate in the airline industry, prompting companies to continuously review and improve their procedures to ensure乘客 safety and satisfaction.

But now that former employee, who lost his job following the incident, is countersuing, saying he’s the victim in the whole ordeal. Alejandro Anastasia, the former employee, is now suing for $1 million, saying he was assaulted by the passenger and that United failed to provide proper training and a safe work environment. Grandfather Ronald Tigner was turned away from the TSA at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston for having an illegible ticket during the incident. He then approached United employees, Anastasia and Ianthe Phillips-Allred, to request another boarding pass. According to Tigner’s suit, he asked the United employees for a new boarding pass, but Anastasia and Phillips-Allred allegedly refused, “laughed” and “cursed” at the passenger, before Anastasia pushed him down. In Anastasia’s version of the encounter, he told TODAY that Tigner approached him telling him that United needed to “hire people that speak English,” after an employee at the ticket counter had trouble understanding him. \"The lady behind the counter didn’t understand me, didn’t really speak very good English,\" Tigner said. He then sought out Anastasia's help fixing his ticket. In court documents, Anastasia claimed that Tigner began shouting profanities and using racial slurs during their conversation. Tigner denies using racial slurs. A surveillance video released in June shows Anastasia appearing to push Tigner to the ground, where he remains motionless and unattended for nearly a minute before a passenger comes to his aid. Related: Video Shows United Employee Shoving Elderly Passenger to the Ground Anastasia said he outstretched his arms and backed away after Tigner “got in [his] face” and stepped on his toe, according to court documents. “I’m not going around pushing elderly people,” Anastasia said.

They rank most popular among frozen chicken products, and over 73 million Americans regularly consumed them in 2020. With their boneless, bite-sized shapes, it’s easy to forget that these products come from a living chicken—one who most likely lived his entire short life in a windowless, ammonia-filled shed, packed wing-to-wing with other chickens. So, how are chicken nuggets made, and where are they produced? The production of chicken nuggets is thriving in the United States. People purchase more chicken than any other type of meat, and chicken consumption has been steadily increasing since the 1960s. In 2020, chicken was the number one protein consumed in the U.S., at a whopping 98 pounds per capita—nearly triple the per capita consumption of the 1960s. But what many people don’t know, as they pull up to a fast food drive-through after a long day at work, is how the invention of chicken nuggets led to the emergence of this colossal industry. During World War II, U.S. civilians faced a shortage of red meat, the preferred dietary protein at the time, and people turned to chicken as a replacement. Farmers and businesses stepped in to meet the increased demand, modernizing the industry to grow chickens faster and more cheaply. Yet the end of the war brought a sudden decrease in chicken consumption. Research was undertaken in attempts to revitalize the industry, and in 1963 Robert C. Baker invented chicken nuggets in a Cornell University laboratory. He then sent the recipe to companies and nuggets became an instant success, eventually becoming ubiquitous on fast food menus nationwide. The industry gained another boost in the late 1970s when U.S. dietary guidelines raised concerns about red meat consumption and encouraged people to eat more chicken. When McDonald’s introduced its branded chicken nuggets in the early 1980s, the product sold better than any other item on its menu. The U.S. demand for chicken was solidified with the successful marketing of the nugget, and farmers sought to increase their profits by breeding chickens selectively for rapid weight gain and growth. The invention of the chicken nugget helped launch an industry that slaughters 25 million chickens per day in the U.S., but what’s really in this breadcrumb-coated fast food staple? The chicken nugget contains very little actual meat. Rather, nuggets are mostly fat and other assorted body parts, including nerves, bone, skin, and connective tissue. According to an analysis performed by researchers at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, fast food nuggets from two restaurants contained nearly 60 percent fat and only 18–19 percent protein. In addition to large quantities of fat, the researchers detected microscopic bone shards and connective tissue, like tendons and ligaments, leading them to raise concerns about the health ramifications of this product, which is frequently marketed to, and considered a favorite meal of, children. Chicken nuggets also contain a variety of other ingredients, including emulsifiers and thickeners, wheat-based batter, vegetable oil, sodium phosphate, anti-foaming agents, monosodium glutamate (MSG), anti-caking agents such as calcium silicate, dextrose, yeast extracts, propylene glycol, modified cornstarch, whey (a milk product), and various preservatives and fillers. They are high in sodium, and a six-piece serving of chicken nuggets can contain anywhere from 270 to a hefty 500 milligrams of sodium, depending on the restaurant. A 10-piece box of nuggets from McDonald’s will contain nearly half of an adult’s daily sodium requirements. Eating more than the recommended amount of sodium can lead to health problems like high blood pressure, as well as increasing the risk of stroke, heart disease, and cancer. And to prepare them, nuggets are often fried in oil, which has been shown to have a strong connection to chronic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and heart failure. Given the poor nutritional content and unhealthy ingredients of chicken nuggets, nutritionists and doctors have understandably sounded the alarm about the possible long-term health effects of a diet dominated by foods like chicken nuggets. In addition to an enhanced risk of chronic disease, these effects include headaches, depression, dental disease, high cholesterol, and acne. Animal suffering can also be added to the list of the nugget’s negative consequences. Chickens whose bodies are used to make nuggets experience short, painful lives in crowded factory farms. While the shape, size, and convenience of chicken nuggets may make it easy to disconnect from this fact, nuggets nevertheless come from once-living chickens who valued their lives in much the same way people do. Chickens raised for meat products like chicken nuggets are called “broilers” or “broiler chickens.” These chickens have been bred to grow very fast and gain weight quickly. Their rapid growth causes painful bone defects, inability to move around, foot lesions, and sudden death. They are slaughtered at only five to seven weeks old. But how do chickens go from living birds to the unrecognizable nugget on someone’s plate? Eggs from the breeding birds are removed and placed in incubators. Once they hatch, the chicks are kept together in a large barn for up to 72 hours. The chicks travel along a conveyor belt to be dropped into transport boxes. They are moved to large sheds with artificial lighting (most have no windows or access to the outdoors) on a “grow-out farm.” A typical shed has tens of thousands of chickens crowded inside. Sheds are generally barren and one-level, equipped only with drinking lines and feeders, and perhaps some litter on the ground. Often the sheds are not cleaned, nor is fresh litter provided for the birds. Here, they live the rest of their short lives. Workers catch chickens by their legs and put them into transport crates, and they often suffer painful injuries like broken bones in the process. The crates, packed so full that the chickens can barely move, are loaded onto trucks. Chickens then endure hours of transport with no food or water and are subjected to extremes of heat and cold before reaching the slaughterhouse. Many birds will die from injuries, exposure, and stress before even arriving for slaughter. At the slaughterhouse, chickens are hung upside down in shackles and then passed through an electrified water bath to immobilize them, a process that frequently leaves chickens fully conscious. The chickens then pass through a mechanical rotating blade that is intended to cut their throats; however, this process often misses the arteries in the neck that ensure rapid death from blood loss. Research shows that hundreds of millions of chickens may pass through this stage of slaughter fully awake and experience intense fear and suffering. Next, chickens are dumped into vats of boiling water to loosen their feathers, and put through a machine called a “picker,” where hundreds of rubber “fingers” remove the feathers. Chickens who did not bleed out during the previous stage face excruciating pain as they are scalded alive. After the “picker,” the birds move to a mechanized eviscerating line, where their internal organs and feet are removed. The bodies of the chickens are rinsed with substances, which may include chlorine, to disinfect them and reduce bacterial growth. Chicken carcasses destined to become products like nuggets undergo additional processing. They are cut up (often on a mechanized assembly line that can be programmed to perform certain cuts), deboned, and mechanically separated. The meat is ground, then forced under high pressure through screens that reduce the meat, bones, and other parts into a paste. This paste is mixed with chicken skin and additives, including starch and sodium phosphate, and then shaped into nuggets. The newly formed nuggets are breaded, partially fried, and prepared for shipping. Although the chicken nugget, with its cheerful packaging and tasty sauces, may appear innocuous, it drives an industry that’s exacting high costs in terms of environmental degradation, animal suffering, and human health. Runoff from farms pollutes rivers, lakes, and ponds, causing harmful algae blooms, and killing fish and other aquatic animals. Contamination of water sources by heavy metals and pathogenic bacteria in chicken manure can cause disease and death in wildlife. Land degradation can also easily occur when soil is overfertilized with runoff and becomes fouled with waste byproducts. Chicken farming contributes to global emissions of greenhouse gases, and broiler production emits 45 percent more harmful greenhouse gases than other forms of poultry production. People who live near intensive chicken farms experience illness from water and air pollution. Poultry production releases significant amounts of ammonia, methane, and sulfur dioxide, and causes elevated levels of particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and nitrogenous compounds. Airborne ammonia can cause eye and lung irritation in both residents and workers, and other airborne compounds can lead to bronchitis, asthma, heart disease, and lung cancer. Nearby residents suffer from strong odors and increased populations of insects that spread disease, like flies and mosquitoes. Research conducted by the Ohio Department of Health found that people living near large chicken farms dealt with 83 times as many flies and mosquitoes as those living in other areas. People living near chicken farms also experience economic losses due to decreased property values and may not be able to afford to move to places with clean water and air. Chickens raised for food products like nuggets suffer their entire lives. These sentient, intelligent birds are deprived of every natural and normal behavior from their birth to their death. Hens, who are caring and attentive mothers, are artificially inseminated. Their eggs are removed, and they are never given the opportunity to raise their chicks. Breeding birds are routinely starved to prevent the rapid weight gain in broilers that leads to early death. Chicks are held in overcrowded, dark sheds with no natural light or access to the outdoors. Often, they don’t even have enough room to spread their wings. High ammonia levels in the sheds cause eye ulcers, burns, and skin inflammation. Wet, dirty litter leads to painful contact dermatitis and infections. Birds raised in “free-range” conditions don’t have it much better, where access to outdoors usually means a few small openings into a barren, fenced yard. Because so many chickens are crammed together in a shed, only a few can actually access these spaces. Broiler chickens’ unnatural growth leads to further suffering—their legs are unable to support their body weight, leading to collapse. Some will slowly starve or dehydrate as they lie in their own feces. With inadequate ventilation in the sheds, some also expire from heat stress. Millions die before even reaching the slaughterhouse, and the ones who survive face the agony of being electrocuted and having their throats slit, often while fully conscious. The demand for quick and easy products like chicken nuggets has driven an industry that exacts a heavy toll on the environment and human health. It has created a system based on the suffering and death of billions of smart, sentient birds. And it’s unsustainable. Consumers can help by choosing to forego nuggets and other products made from animals. Routinely selecting plant-based foods is one of the best ways to decrease the number of animals slaughtered. There are many plant-based options for chicken nuggets, which means people can get their nugget fix without harming animals or contributing to environmental degradation. Companies like NUGGS, MorningStar, Gardein, Alpha Foods, and BOCA, to name just a few, all have tasty selections available. Can Chicken Farming Really Be Sustainable?

Chicken breast is separated and collected into a bin. The bin o’ chicken is then ground up and chicken skin and seasoning is added to a meat blender. The blended chicken is then shaped into the four official chicken nugget shapes and dabbed with a light and heavy batter. The chicken nugget contains very little actual meat. Rather, nuggets are mostly fat and other assorted body parts, including nerves, bone, skin, and connective tissue. Yes, every patty is 100% real beef with no fillers, additives or preservatives. Curious about our burgers? We have answers to all of your questions about McDonald’s burgers and beef. Although McDonald’s switched to white breast meat starting in the mid-2000s, there are still many additives in the McNugget due to the need to preserve it from factory to table. Related Neve | Powered by WordPress", "By Deborah Kotz Ever break open the inside of a chicken nugget and wonder what the white stuff was beneath the breading? It turns out chicken muscle — what we traditionally think of as meat — makes up less than half of the chicken in nuggets sold at two popular fast-food chains. The rest is ground up fat, bones, blood vessels and skin from the chicken, according to a new study published in the American Journal of Medicine. The study authors declined to name the two chains where they purchased the deep-fried nuggets and analyzed their contents under a microscope, but they did conclude that “chicken nuggets are mostly fat, and their name is a misnomer.’’ While white meat chicken is one of the best sources of lean protein, “some companies have chosen to use an artificial mixture of chicken parts — rather than low-fat chicken white meat — batter it up and fry it and still call it chicken,’’ study author Dr. Richard D. deShazo of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson said in an interview with Reuters Health. I did a little searching on the dieting website CalorieKing.com to see how the nutritional value stacks up among chicken nuggets at various popular chains. (These are all for plain nuggets without the sauce.) The last in the list clearly comes out on top. 1. McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets: The chain’s website says the nuggets “are made with USDA-inspected white meat.’’ A four-piece serving contains 190 calories, 9 grams of protein, and 12 grams of fat — plus 12 grams of carbohydrates which is largely the flour-based batter. 2. Burger King Chicken Nuggets: Made with “premium white meat,’’ four nuggets contain 190 calories, 8 grams of protein, 11 grams of fat, and 13 grams of carbohydrates. 3. Wendy’s Chicken Nuggets: The fast-food chain proclaims on its website that “our nuggets are made with all white-meat chicken.’’ A four-piece serving contains 180 calories, 9 grams of protein, 12 grams of fat, and 10 grams of carbohydrates. 4. Popeye’s Chicken Tenders: Four nuggets contain 153 calories, 7 grams of protein, 9 grams of fat, and 9 grams of carbohydrates. Popeye’s claims that its tenders — which are batter fried and nugget shaped — contain “100% whole breast meat’’. Note: Each nugget is 0.4 ounces, somewhat smaller than the other chains with nuggets weighing 0.5 to 0.6 ounces. 5. Kentucky Fried Chicken Original Recipe Bites: These look like the best among all the options. Four bites, weighing 0.6 ounces each, contain 132 calories, 6 grams of fat, and 5 grams of carbohydrates. And they pack a notable 15 grams of protein. That’s a much better fat-protein ratio than the other options. The KFC website says each bite contains “100% breast meat,’’ and they likely use less batter in every bite. ©2023 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC Stay up to date with everything Boston.

The controversial figure, whose name has long been synonymous with zero-tolerance policies, now faces charges that have raised questions about the line between enforcing the law and personal conduct.\n\nSheriff Johnathan \"Jack\" Reed's tenure was marked by his relentless efforts to eradicate drug-related crimes in the region, particularly targeting the harmful influence on vulnerable young adults. He championed community-based initiatives that stressed education, prevention, and intervention, attempting to protect the next generation from the devastating effects of substance abuse. His commitment to public safety was widely admired, but it seems that his own actions have come under scrutiny.\n\nRecently, allegations surfaced alleging that Sheriff Reed may have crossed lines in his personal life, potentially violating the trust placed in him by the very community he served. The charges against him, which have not been detailed extensively to protect the integrity of the legal process, have led to the suspension of his duties and a thorough investigation by local authorities.\n\nThe incident has sparked a heated debate regarding the accountability of law enforcement officials and the expectations placed upon them. Many are questioning whether the zero-tolerance policies that Reed implemented were rooted in a genuine desire to protect or if they merely served as a veil for his own potential misconduct. The case serves as a stark reminder that even those who hold positions of power and responsibility are not immune to the consequences of their actions.\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, the community is grappling with the reality that even those who have dedicated their lives to serving and protecting can face scrutiny. While it is crucial to maintain a strong police presence, the integrity of the system relies on the transparency and fairness of its enforcement. The outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications not only for Reed's career but also for the broader trust that citizens place in their local law enforcement.\n\nPublic officials, advocates, and critics alike are now watching closely to see how the legal process unfolds and whether justice will be served in a way that maintains the balance between upholding the law and understanding the complexities of human behavior.

Sullivan was sentenced to 38 days in jail, with credit for eight days already served, and two years of probation for felony possession of methamphetamine and a misdemeanor count of solicitation for prostitution. He must pay $1,100 in penalties. Sullivan was the sheriff in Arapahoe County from 1984 until 2002, when he resigned to become security director of the Cherry Creek School District. He retired from the district in 2008. The 69-year-old was arrested after a sting operation last year in which investigators say he offered methamphetamine to a man in exchange for sex. He was held in custody in a jail that was named after him. Charges of distribution of methamphetamine and attempting to influence a public servant against him were dismissed. The defense told the judge Sullivan had a stellar record during his 19 years as sheriff and his position shouldn't be used against him, reports CBS Denver. But prosecutors argued Sullivan disgraced the badge and used his authority to commit criminal activity. Sullivan apologized Tuesday in court and said there is no excuse for his behavior. \"I plan to seek forgiveness from those I have harmed,\" Sullivan said, seated at a table. \"I want to move forward in my life in a positive direction.\" According to CBS Denver, Sullivan has had surgery on both legs and his lower left leg is paralyzed.

All Rights Reserved. Copyright ©2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

Sullivan was known for his no-nonsense style, his heroism in saving two deputies and for his concern about teenage drug use. He was even named the nation's sheriff of the year. Today, he's accused of offering methamphetamine in exchange for sex from a male acquaintance, and he's locked up in the jail that bears his name, the Patrick Sullivan Jr. Detention Facility. CBS Denver reports the 68-year-old ex-lawman's arrest came after an investigation that began in mid-November. Sullivan is being held on a half-million-dollar bond. Contacts familiar with the case say several informants gave information attesting that Sullivan was connected to the distribution and use of meth. The arrest affidavit said confidential informants who alerted police to the case claimed Sullivan was dealing the drug, and would only sell it if they had sex with him. In order to investigate further, deputies set up a sting at a home, during which Sullivan allegedly agreed to meet a male informant and provide him drugs in exchange for sex. Investigators and Drug Task Force members arrested Sullivan and say he was carrying two bags of meth. The current Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson said, \"The allegations of criminal behavior involving Pat Sullivan are extraordinarily disturbing. While the arrest of the former sheriff is very troubling, no one, and particularly a former peace officer is above the law. This is the most shocking thing I've ever been involved with.\" Sullivan is expected to face a felony drug charge and Robinson said he predicts more criminal charges against Sullivan. According to CBS SDenver, in the last several years Sullivan posted bond many times for suspects in drug cases who were held in jail. In 2007 and 2008, Sullivan actively participated in state and local meth task forces, created to help the state deal with the drug problem. Sullivan was the Arapahoe County Sheriff from 1984 until his retirement in 2002. His work in homeland security was praised, and he was named Sheriff of the Year by the National Sheriff's Association in 2001, and for his work as law enforcement chairman of the Colorado George W.

DENVER – A former Colorado lawman who was once named the nation's sheriff of the year was charged Friday with drug and prostitution offenses after authorities said he offered methamphetamine to a man in exchange for sex. Patrick Sullivan Jr., 68, was being held on $500,000 bond in an isolation cell at a jail named in his honor in suburban Denver. Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson said current or former law enforcement officials are usually kept from the general inmate population for their safety at the Patrick J. Sullivan Jr. Detention Facility. Prosecutors charged Sullivan with felony distribution, possession of meth as well as a misdemeanor charge of soliciting prostitution. Authorities say he offered methamphetamine in exchange for sex from a male acquaintance in a sting set up by officers with a drug task force. Sullivan also is charged with attempting to influence a public servant following a Sept. 20 report of an \"old man\" inside a home that the caller said he wanted to leave. An incident report notes a man at the house reported Sullivan was getting three recovering addicts back into drugs. Sullivan told investigators he was helping them out as part of his work with a law enforcement and state drug rehab program. Officials have no record of Sullivan working for either. Sheriff's officials say Sullivan has declined to grant interviews while incarcerated. Sullivan was sheriff of the suburban Denver county from 1984 until 2002, when he retired. He was hailed as a hero following a daring 1989 rescue in which he crashed a vehicle through a fence to provide cover for two of his deputies who were pinned by gunfire. He was also named Sheriff of the Year by the National Sheriff's Association and praised by former Rep. Tom Tancredo in 2002. Meanwhile, Robinson said police talked to him in January about Sullivan as part of an investigation into the unsolved drowning death of a man. Robinson said a detective contacted him in January for insight into the personality of Sullivan. \"He told me they were interested in interviewing Sullivan,\" Robinson said. Denver police refuse to say whether they questioned Sullivan or what information they sought in the Jan. 26 drowning death of 27-year-old Sean Moss. An autopsy found intoxication from meth and gamma-hydroxybutryic acid that's a rave drug known by various street names such as \"Liquid Ecstasy,\" that's also a date rape drug, contributed to Moss' death. Police spokesman Sonny Jackson said the case remains open because the coroner was unable to determine if Moss' death was accidental, a suicide or homicide. The Denver Post reported that Sullivan had posted bail for Moss after his arrest Jan. 14 in a domestic violence case in Centennial, a suburb of Denver. That case involved a fight that broke out in a car on Interstate 25 between Moss and a man described by investigators as Moss' boyfriend, according to an incident report from the Arapahoe County sheriff's office. The incident report said Moss and the other man were living together at the time. Both men were arrested. Moss was carrying a backpack packed with a denture brush, eight pairs of socks, some clothes, and other personal items when his body was found in the South Platte River southeast of downtown Denver. Robinson said he knew little about the Moss investigation because that was Denver's case. A Denver man remained in custody in a Denver jail Friday over allegations he supplied methamphetamine to Sullivan. Robinson said Timothy Faase, 49, was arrested Tuesday after investigators tailed Sullivan to Faase's Denver apartment. Faase was being held in a Denver jail on suspicion of drug trafficking and possession of more than 2 grams of methamphetamine. His bond was set at $25,000.

He was 78. Sullivan served as sheriff between 1984 and 2002, and was considered a local law enforcement legend — the jail was named after him — until 2011, when he was arrested and charged with trading methamphetamine for sex after he was caught in an undercover sting by his own former agency. Sullivan had become a hero to some for his anti-drug crusades during his tenure as the top cop in Arapahoe County. He also was applauded in 1989 when he drove a Jeep through the fence of an Arapahoe County home to rescue two deputies and a wounded 17-year-old boy who had been taken hostage by a rape and murder suspect armed with a machine gun. Sullivan’s rapid fall from grace shocked the law enforcement community, and court documents painted a picture of a man who lived a double life for years — running the sheriff’s office while also using illegal drugs, meeting young men for sex and attempting to leverage his position in law enforcement to his personal advantage. In 2012, Sullivan pleaded guilty to felony possession of methamphetamine and soliciting prostitution and was initially sentenced to 30 days in jail and two years of probation. In 2014, however, he was re-sentenced to 15 months in prison after he repeatedly violated his probation by missing or tampering with urine samples. Sullivan at the time apologized and told the judge he’d “had a drug problem” for a long time. His cause of death was not immediately available, and his daughter did not return a request for comment. After retiring from the sheriff’s office, Sullivan worked as the head of security for Cherry Creek Schools until 2008.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has formally declared himself a member of the Democratic Party as he seeks its presidential nomination in 2020, abiding by new Democratic National Committee rules. \"I am a member of the Democratic Party,\" reads the statement to the DNC that Sanders signed and notarized Tuesday. It also asserts that Sanders will serve as a Democrat if elected president and that the DNC can determine who is \"a bonafide Democrat.\" Sanders, a political independent who caucuses with Democrats in the Senate, has long resisted calls to formally join the Democratic Party, which continues to be a sore spot for mainline Democrats skeptical of the self-described Democratic socialist. As the DNC prepared the rules for the 2020 nominating contest, it sought to clarify its membership requirements — over Sanders allies' vocal objections — by requiring every presidential candidate to sign the loyalty pledge. The party sent all declared candidates the form last Wednesday and Thursday and they have one week to return it signed, according to a DNC spokesperson. But even now, the depth and permanence of Sanders' commitment to the party remains murky. On Monday, Sanders filed paperwork to run for reelection to the Senate in 2024 — but as an independent. That's the same affiliation he ran on last year when he won another six-year term representing Vermont. When Sanders ran for president in 2016, there was some question about whether he would qualify for the ballot in New Hampshire, home to the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, because state law requires candidates to be a member of the party they're seeking to represent in the general election. The chairman of the state Democratic party personally accompanied Sanders to the secretary of state's office to vouch for him and make sure the candidate would get on the ballot. \"I am the longest-serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. That’s how the people of Vermont sent me to Washington and I'm proud of that,\" Sanders told reporters after filing for his paperwork in New Hampshire in late 2015. \"And I had to make a decision six months ago. Do I run as a Democrat or do I run as an Independent? And I made that decision. I am running as a Democrat, obviously. I am a Democrat now.\" A reporter followed up by asking if Sanders would run in all potential future elections as a Democrat and Sanders replied, \"Yes.\" His closest aide, then-campaign manager Jeff Weaver, reiterated that sentiment later in an interview when asked if Sanders was a member of the party for life. But since his first bid for mayor of Burlington, Sanders has always run for office as an independent in Vermont. In fact, as mayor, he fought an extended battle with Democrats on the City Council, who sought to thwart him at every turn and win back a seat they felt was rightfully theirs. He won that fight in Burlington by getting allies to run on a new third party, the Progressive Party, which has since become a powerful force in Vermont politics. But Sanders has declined to join even that party, which he had a hand in creating, preferring always to maintain his independence. For years, he has been the de-facto Democratic nominee for the Senate, with party leaders offering their support and discouraging self-declared Democrats from challenging him. Moreover, Vermont is one of a handful of states where voters do not register by party and can participate in any primary they wish, so Sanders has never had to officially declare his personal partisan membership.

Trump back in the White House, Clinton said during an appearance on ABC’s daytime talkshow The View on Wednesday, “would be the end of our country as we know it, and I don’t say that lightly”. The former first lady, senator and secretary of state said: “When I was secretary of state, I used to talk about ‘one and done’. What I meant by that is that people would get legitimately elected and then they would try to do away with elections, and do away with opposition, and do away with a free press.” Then Clinton added: “Hitler was duly elected. All of a sudden somebody with those tendencies, dictatorial, authoritarian tendencies, would be like ‘OK we’re gonna shut this down, we’re gonna throw these people in jail.’ And they didn’t usually telegraph that. Trump is telling us what he intends to do.” Clinton’s comments came days after a Washington Post report detailing how Trump is discussing how to use the justice department to investigate political rivals and former allies who have been critical of him should he return to the White House. He is also discussing invoking the Insurrection Act on his first day in office, which would allow him to use the US military domestically to quell protests and dissent, something he was talked out of by military leaders during his one-term presidency. Trump’s team is also preparing to staff a potential administration with more radical rightwing lawyers who are less likely to stymie efforts to get in his way as he pushes the bounds of presidential power, the New York Times reported. A New York Times/Siena poll released on Sunday shows Trump leading Joe Biden in several key battleground states. Trump faces criminal charges in four different cases, set to go to trial next year. Winning the presidency is widely understood to be Trump’s best chance of escaping liability. And the poll shows that many voters who were asked would switch back to Biden if Trump is convicted. But Clinton gave a clear warning. “Trump is telling us what he intends to do,” Clinton said on The View. “Take him at his word.”", "Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video ST. LOUIS, Missouri — Several speeches at the 2023 Fall Meetings for the Democratic National Committee featured party leaders describing efforts to court working-class voters. Labor leaders celebrated President Joe Biden's appearance at the United Auto Workers' picket line, the first of its kind in history. \"There is no Democratic Party without the American labor movement,\" UFCW Executive Vice President Stuart Appelbaum said. While Biden promised he'd be the most pro-labor president ever, labor unrest has surged on his watch as workers rally for better pay across several industries. Some Democrats at the DNC Fall Meetings blamed that unrest on Republican policies they argued fed into unfettered corporate greed. Sen. Bernie Sanders, however, laid a portion of the blame at the feet of Democrats for giving Republicans an opening to woo working-class voters. \"In too many instances, the Democratic Party has turned its back on the working class,\" Sanders told the DNC Labor Council over a remote video call. \"I am pleased and proud that Biden walked that picket line. That's a major step forward. But we have got to do a lot more.\" DNC chairman Jaime Harrison plans to join St. Louis area laborers at the UAW picket line in Wentzville on Friday. \"Our economy is built on them. So we're going to let them know that we have their backs,\" Harrison told 5 On Your Side. Harrison reacted to Sanders' warnings that former President Donald Trump is winning working-class voters over. \"The middle class in this country is built on the backs of working people, on the backs of union members,\" he said. \"Corporations are important because they bring good jobs and all that, but at the end of the day, a corporation is only as good as the people who work in it.\" In his speech to the Labor Council, Sanders painted Trump as a hypocrite on labor issues and called for the party to improve its outreach to labor union members. \"During his four years as president, his major law was to give tax breaks to billionaires who work against unions,\" Sanders said. \"Despite the fact that the president is now under indictment on four separate cases, in some of the polls, he is actually winning; and among working class people, he has an enormous amount of support. That's a fact. You may not like it. It is a reality.\" \"We have to address that issue,\" Sanders said. \"You can't run away from it because if you run away from we ain't gonna have much of a country left.\" Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings.", "Course blog for INFO 2040/CS 2850/Econ 2040/SOC 2090 Bernie Sanders, Vermont’s most vocal progressive politician, stirred controversy in 2016 when he launched his campaign for the Democratic party’s nomination for President. Some of this controversy was rooted in his ideologies that many considered to be too radical for a U.S. President, but many critiqued the politician more heavily based simply on his choice to run for the Democratic Party’s nominee position. You may ask yourself, why was it such a big deal that a somewhat radical democrat campaigned for the Democratic party’s presidential nomination? The answer is: because he’s not a democrat. He’s an independent. Bernie Sanders throughout his political history has chosen not to affiliate with a political party and has proclaimed himself to be independent. As described in the Chicago Tribune article that inspired this blog post, many Democrats took offense to his choice to campaign for a nomination in a party that he does not prescribe to, even considering his mainly democratic views. The article investigates and explains the reasoning behind Bernie’s bold choice, yet Sanders’ own explanation for his move to run as a Democrat was quite straightforward. Sanders describes that, in order to attract media coverage, raise campaign funds, and essentially establish his legitimacy as a potential Presidential candidate, he “had to run with the Democratic Party”. The author of the article, Ralph Nader, describes America’s two-party landscape in which one’s best option to achieve political success and garner support is to align with either the Democratic or Republican party. Nader has a unique perspective into this dilemma, as he himself is a politician that has ran for public office as a member of alternate political parties. These alternate “third-parties”, such as the Green Party or Libertarian Party, tend to have a smaller following, which makes it harder for candidates that represent those parties to generate momentum behind their campaigns. Being an independent can be lumped into these third-parties, as it is an alternate political affiliation that historically loses to the the force of the combined Democrats and Republicans. Using Hubs and Authorities as a lens to analyze this situation, one can provide a detailed explanation behind Bernie’s choice to align with the Democrats in the 2016 election cycle. Although this analysis will not include actual values for hubs and authorities, it will still be useful in investigating U.S. politics as it pertains to Bernie Sanders’ party affiliations. One can consider political candidates for public office to be Hubs, while the parties they align with can be seen as Authorities that these candidates are connected to. Like in other Hubs and Authorities scenarios, multiple Hubs (candidates) can link to the same Authority (party) and even vice versa. For instance, taking the office of the President as the office to be considered, both Mitt Romney and Donald Trump, two “Hubs”, have aligned with the Republican Party, one “Authority”, in their presidential campaigns. The converse instance, although less prominent, does exist; Ron Paul, one “Hub”, has aligned with both the Libertarian Party and the Republican Party, two “Authorities”. This is a similar case to Sanders’ political situation. He is one candidate who has identified as Independent but also as a Democrat. Using this conceptualization of candidates and parties as Hubs and Authorities, it becomes extremely clear why Bernie ran as a Democrat. An Authority’s “Authority score” can be found as a sum of the scores of all of the Hubs that connect to it, and afterwards a Hub can be scored as a sum of all the Authority scores for the Authorities that connect to that Hub. These scores are updated multiple times in multiple “rounds”, where the authority score is updated first (based on the hub scores) and the hub scores are updated thereafter (based on the authority scores). It is obvious that, as one of the two major political parties, the Democratic Party has numerous candidates that “link” with the party and hence affiliate with it in campaigns for public office. Taking the Democratic Party to be an Authority, it must have a high authority score as a product of the many Hubs, or candidates, that have aligned with it. This is a sign of the Democratic Party’s strong legitimacy and popularity. Hence, the Democrats’ high authority score benefits the Hubs, or candidates, that align with it. Candidates like Bernie Sanders obtain a high Hub score by nature of being connected to the Democratic Party and its high Authority score (and the same would go for the many candidates aligned with the Republican Party). This can be justified by the idea that, when a Hub is linked to a strong authority, the Hub gains “value”, or legitimacy, power, and support, from aligning with a powerful and well respected authority. This means that Sanders running as a Democrat allows him to not only benefit from the prestige and value of Independents as a political affiliation, but now also from the power of the Democratic Party. As multiple “rounds” progress and as time goes on, the Hubs and Authorities connected to each other mutually benefit even more, and this benefit is greatest for the Hubs linked to strong Authorities. Authorities will continuously accumulate a higher score with every Hub linked to them, and these Hubs will be strongest by being linked to strong authorities. While third parties will accumulate a small score from the few candidates that typically exclusively align with that third party, the Democratic Party will accumulate a high score from the large and ever-increasing pool of powerful politicians that choose to align with their party. This perfectly depicts the reasoning behind Bernie’s move to run for the Democratic Party’s nomination. As a Hub, Bernie will accumulate large support and legitimacy over time due to affiliating with the powerful Democratic party, an Authority with many links to many other important and popular politicians. Running as a Democrat gave him the best chance to become the President, and this strategy overcomes all controversy and quarrel concerning an Independent entering the race within one of the two major political parties.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) officially joined the Democratic Party, a change he was required to make to receive the DNC nomination. “I hereby affirm that, upon publicly announcing my candidacy for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2020 election, I am a member of the Democratic Party,” Sanders declared in a statement released on his website. “I will run as a Democrat, accept the nomination of my Party, and I will serve as a Democrat if elected.” While Sanders previously ran for the party’s nomination and caucuses with Democrats, he has run as an independent his entire Senate career — dating back to 2006. His label as an independent has contributed to criticism lobbed at him from party-loyal Democrats, who often paint Sanders as a hostile outsider given his past resistance to officially joining the party. However, the DNC changed its rules for the 2020 election and forced Sanders to join the party to run in the Democratic primary. The second paragraph of Sanders’ statement added the following: “I acknowledge that the National Chairperson of the DNC is authorized to determine whether a presidential candidate has established substantial support for their nomination as the Democratic candidate has established substantial support for their nomination as the Democratic candidate for the Office of the President of the United States, is a bona fide Democrat whose record of public service, accomplishments, public writings and/or public statements affirmatively demonstrate that the candidate is faithful to the interests, welfare, and success of the Democratic Party of the United States, and will participate in the Convention in good faith.” [image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images] Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com Caleb Ecarma was a reporter at Mediaite.

The DNC was fined $105,000 and the Clinton campaign was fined $8,000, according to a letter sent by the Federal Election Commission to a conservative group that requested an inquiry. Trump brazenly asks Putin to release dirt about Biden's family Political candidates and groups are required to publicly disclose their spending to the FEC, and they must explain the purpose of any specific expenditure more than $200. The FEC concluded that the Clinton campaign and DNC misreported the money that funded the dossier, masking it as “legal services” and “legal and compliance consulting” instead of opposition research. The dossier was compiled by retired British spy Christopher Steele. It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump’s campaign had numerous contacts with Russian agents, and embraced Russian help, but no one was ever formally accused of conspiring with Russia. The money trail behind the Steele dossier has been a subject of intense political scrutiny for years. More than $1 million flowed from the Clinton campaign and DNC to the law firm Perkins Coie, which then hired the opposition research company Fusion GPS. That company later hired Steele and asked him to use his overseas contacts to dig up dirt about Trump’s ties to Russia. Steele has maintained that his research was unverified, required further investigation and was not meant for public disclosure. But his memos were leaked in January 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Over the years, a series of investigations and lawsuits have discredited many of Steele’s central allegations about collusion and exposed the unreliability of Steele’s sourcing. In the letter announcing the fines, the FEC also revealed that it dismissed related complaints against Steele, Perkins Coie and Fusion GPS, which have all previously denied wrongdoing. The Clinton campaign and the DNC never conceded that they violated campaign finance laws, but they agreed to drop their pushback and accept the civil fines, according to the FEC letter. A DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has “settled aging and silly” FEC complaints about 2016. A lawyer who represented the Clinton campaign in the FEC case didn’t answer CNN’s request for comment. Both entities previously said that they didn’t know the details of Steele’s work in real-time. They’ve also said the Trump campaign’s links to Russia posed a national security risk – which was the same conclusion reached by a bipartisan Senate probe in 2020. © 2023 Cable News Network.

So, I do think that, just like any American, if there is evidence, that evidence should be pursued,” Clinton told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” “But I know it’s not an easy call. And so, I don’t want to inject my opinion into that difficult calculation. Because I don’t know all the facts. And unlike people who jump to conclusions, I don’t want to do that. But if the evidence proves or seems to show that there are charges that should be leveled, then I think the rule of law should apply to anyone,” Clinton said. Judge throws out Trump's sprawling lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, ex-FBI officials over Russia probe The FBI executed a search warrant last month at the former President’s Mar-a-Lago home and resort in Florida, seizing 11,000 documents, including more than 100 classified government records. On Friday, in the latest legal turn in the historic criminal investigation, the DOJ and Trump’s lawyers submitted their respective nominees to serve as the “special master” to review the materials seized from Mar-a-Lago and offered vastly different proposals for how the process should work. Clinton, who lost to Trump in the 2016 presidential election, said Sunday that while she “cannot predict what the Justice Department will do at the end of its investigation … holding people accountable is central to our nation.” “Both as secretary of state and as a private citizen, I have answered every question, I’ve ever been asked. I’ve testified for eleven hours. I’ve, you know, been involved in anything that was asked of me to try to answer any kind of issues. I think that’s the way the system is supposed to work,” Clinton said. Clinton faced scrutiny during the 2016 presidential campaign over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and the potential deliberate mishandling of classified information. An investigation by the State Department found there was no “persuasive evidence” of widespread mishandling of classified information in the controversy over her emails. Clinton was also cleared of wrongdoing by the FBI twice during the campaign. In a separate interview on “State of the Union” on Sunday, Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner told Bash that he has not yet been briefed on the possible damages from Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents. US intelligence chief tells Congress she's conducting damage assessment of documents taken from Mar-a-Lago “We have not been briefed,” said the Virginia Democrat, who noted that the special master request has delayed any potential briefing. “I think we’ll get some clarity on that in a couple days, and we expect to get that briefing.” Asked about Senate Intelligence Vice Chair Marco Rubio’s comments that the seizure of documents at Mar-a-Lago represented just a “storage argument,” Warner insisted that “everyone on the Intelligence Committee” understands the importance of the investigation, while pointing out that he and Rubio had jointly requested a damage assessment. In a recent interview with a Miami TV station, Rubio diminished the seriousness of the DOJ’s investigation, saying, “I don’t think a fight over storage of documents is worthy of what they have done, which is a full-scale raid.” CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to more accurately reflect Hillary Clinton’s remarks on how Donald Trump should be treated in the Mar-a-Lago investigation.

I have clearly said we – whether you call it radical jihadism or radical Islamism, I’m happy to say either. I think they mean the same thing.” Clinton – who also reupped her call to restore the assault weapons ban – was forceful in dismissing Republicans’ criticism – vocally echoed by Trump – that President Barack Obama and Democrats won’t describe such terror attacks as “radical Islamic terrorism.” Does it matter if Obama uses the term ‘Islamic terrorism’? Clinton’s comments went further than she has before in the language she uses to describe radical Islam and swiftly undercut one of Trump’s central lines of attack against her regarding the fight against terrorism. Her interview Monday morning also notably separated the former Secretary of State from Obama’s approach – in his remarks from the White House on Sunday about the massacre, he never used the words “radical Islam” and he’s made it a point not to do so in similar past domestic attacks. Trump was also interviewed later on “New Day” Monday morning about the Orlando attack, and repeated the charge that Democrats’ reluctance to say “radical Islamic terror” was hampering efforts to combat terror. “The first thing you need is a president that will mention the problem. And he won’t even mention what the problem is,” Trump said. “Unless you’re going to say that, you’re never going to solve it.” Trump then claimed Clinton was “afraid to use [the term] because President Obama doesn’t want her to” before host Christine Romans corrected him, pointing out Clinton had just used the term in the preceding interview. After Romans interjected, Trump replied, “She would love to use those words because almost everybody agrees that those words should be used.” Donald Trump definitely turned 70 years old on Tuesday In her appearance, Clinton also was quick to link the attack to the terror organization. “This was a terrorist attack. ISIS appears to be claiming credit for it, whether it had anything to do with it or not – at a minimum, they seem to have inspired it,” Clinton told host Chris Cuomo. And Clinton took a veiled swipe at Trump, who has proposed temporary banning Muslims from entering the United States, for targeting Muslims in his campaign rhetoric. “What I won’t do, because I think it is dangerous for our efforts to defeat this threat, is to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion,” she said. “That plays right into ISIS’ hands.” Clinton hit Trump by name, saying, “I think that Donald Trump’s rhetoric is quite dangerous to our country.” The presumptive Republican nominee, citing the Orlando attack, also repeated his warning that Muslim communities aren’t doing enough to self-police and report cases of extremism and radicalized individuals before attacks occur. “The communities that we’re talking about, they know about this guy. They knew that this was tremendous potential for blow up,” Trump said. “Right now we have thousands of people in the United State who have the same kind of hate in their heart as he had. And we have to know who they are,” he added. Supreme Court to act on gun ownership cases Trump also reiterated his opposition to accepting Syrian refugees, adding that terror problems “will only get worse.” Clinton, in her interview calling the aftermath of the attacks a “time for statesmanship, not partisanship,” projected confidence in the United States’ ability to defend against future terror attacks. “We have the resources, relationships and experience to get it done,” she said. “And this is a moment – for Republicans, Democrats, independents – for all Americans to work together as one team. It’s time for statesmanship, not partisanship. Our fellow citizens should expect that.” And the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee made the case for stricter gun safety laws in the wake of the massacre, arguing that “common sense gun safety reform across our country would make a difference” while calling for the reinstatement of an assault weapons ban. “We can’t fall into the trap that is set up by the gun lobby that says if you can’t stop every shooting in every incident you should not try to stop any. We did have an assault weapons ban for ten years. I think it should be reinstated,” she said. House Democrats protest lack of action on gun legislation On the other hand, Trump said that if people in Pulse had been armed, the scope of the tragedy would have been lessened. “If you had guns in that room, if you had – even if you had a number of people having them strapped to their ankle or strapped to their waist, where bullets could have flown in the other direction right at him, you wouldn’t have had the same kind of a tragedy,” Trump said on CNN. In a separate interview on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends,” also on Monday, Trump continued to criticize the Obama administration’s anti-terror efforts and even hinted at some hidden motivation for Obama. “We’re led by a man who is very – look, we’re led by a man that either is not tough not smart, or he’s got something else in mind. And the something else in mind, you know, people can’t believe it. People cannot believe, they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and he can’t even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism. There’s something going on.

Little did she know that a simple act of mockery by internet provocateur Matt Drudge would alter the public perception of her tenure in a way that became an enduring symbol of her time in office.\n\nJust three months into her groundbreaking role, Drudge Report, the influential online news aggregator, bestowed upon Napolitano the nickname \"Borderappoint.\" This catchy moniker, with a subtle play on words, was not only a jab at her perceived lack of focus on border security, but also a reflection of the mounting pressure on the DHS Secretary to address the concerns of a nation grappling with immigration and illegal crossings.\n\nIn the era of instant internet notoriety, the \"Borderappointment\" nickname quickly spread across social media and news outlets, becoming a talking point in the nation's political discourse. Critics used it to highlight their dissatisfaction with Napolitano's handling of the complex issue, while supporters claimed it was an unfair characterization that oversimplified her multifaceted responsibilities.\n\nNapolitano's tenure as DHS Secretary was marked by various challenges, from the H1N1 influenza pandemic to the implementation of the Real ID Act. Her critics held that her focus on counterterrorism efforts sometimes overshadowed the pressing need to secure the nation's borders effectively, which led to the \"Borderappointment\" moniker resonating with a wary public.\n\nDespite the nickname, Napolitano remained committed to her duties, implementing various reforms and programs aimed at enhancing homeland security, such as the creation of the Transportation Safety Administration's PreCheck program and the expansion of intelligence sharing with international partners. However, the \"Borderappointment\" label continued to dog her in the media and public forums, further intensifying the scrutiny on her performance.\n\nLooking back, the \"Borderappointment\" nickname serves as a reminder of the complex balancing act faced by federal officials in the realm of homeland security. It underscores the importance of public perception and the impact of a single, catchy phrase on the perception of even the most seasoned leaders.\n\nIn conclusion, Janet Napolitano's brief but significant tenure as the face of the Department of Homeland Security was forever etched with the \"Borderappointment\" moniker, a testament to the power of the internet age and the challenges of managing a department vital to national security. While the nickname may have had its detractors, it also sparked important conversations about border security and the need for a comprehensive approach to homeland defense.", "token_usage": 566, "human_written_evidences": ["– if democrats had opposed president george w. bush ’ s efforts to protect airplanes , the former president likely would have accused them of not caring about national security , and “republicans would no doubt be running ads juxtaposing democrats with osama bin laden , ” writes dana milbank in the washington post . but here we are nine years out from 9/11 , and it ’ s the republicans objecting — “loudly ” — to the new tsa procedures . \" national security is no longer a higher priority than their interest in undermining president obama , ” he writes in a column that also discusses their opposition to the new arms-control treaty with russia . last week on slate , david weigel made a similar point : “before 9/11 , the prevailing conservative/libertarian/republican opinion of the national-security state — of any government effort to protect americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove — was mistrust. ” but we ’ re now in , milbank writes , “the post-post-9/11 era , ” and “for democrats , the opposition ' s gamesmanship with the security should present an opportunity . there ' s no need to resort to the demagoguery once used against democrats , but neither would it hurt the white house and congressional democrats to point out that their opponents are trying to weaken americans ' security . ”\n"], "reference_documents": ["janet napolitano was just three months into her tenure as secretary of homeland security when matt drudge bestowed a nickname on her : \" big sis . \" the nickname stuck , thanks to drudge ' s perseverance . since that first story in april 2009 , the big sis brand has been trotted out for dozens of napolitano stories , from the scary ( \" big sis : napolitano to kill spy-satellite program \" ) to the silly ( \" big sis : napolitano enlists girl scouts in effort to combat hurricanes , pandemics , terror attacks \" ) to — most important — the creepy sexual stuff about the transportation security administration . in january 2010 , drudge linked to a story about the government acquiring body scanners by pressing the caps-lock key and breaking out a photo illustration of napolitano eying a scan of a nude : \" big sis wants to see under your clothes . \" ten months later , there is a full-blown revolt against the tsa and body scanners ( which are sold by a firm with the poetically unfortunate name of rapiscan ) . the revolt will crest next wednesday , with national opt-out day on the busiest travel period of the year . the accidental guerilla heroico of the revolt is john tyner , who refused a full-body scan at san diego international airport then refused to let tsa agents manually search him . \" you touch my junk , \" story_separator_special_tag suppose that during the previous administration the democrats had opposed president bush ' s efforts to protect airplanes from would-be bombers and had blocked his strategy to keep nuclear weapons out of terrorists ' hands . it ' s a safe bet bush would charge , as he did more than once during his presidency , that democrats are \" not interested in the security of the american people . \" other republicans would no doubt be running ads juxtaposing democrats with osama bin laden , or alleging , as they did then , that democrats are giving \" comfort to america ' s enemies . \" yet right now , republicans are providing the comfort . they are objecting loudly to new airport security measures designed to detect bombs hidden under clothing . and they are blocking a senate vote on a treaty with russia that is critical to securing loose nukes and keeping iran from gaining the bomb . for democrats , the opposition ' s gamesmanship with the security should present an opportunity . republicans seem to have entered a post-post-9/11 era , in which national security is no longer a higher priority than their interest in undermining president obama . there ' s no need to resort to the demagoguery once used against democrats , but neither would it hurt the white house and congressional democrats to point out that their opponents are trying to weaken americans ' security . let ' s start with start\n"], "model_retrieved_documents": ["January 27, 2022 WASHINGTON, DC – Republican Members of the House Committee on Homeland Security are calling out the Biden Administration’s policy of allowing arrest warrants to count as a valid form of identification for illegal migrants at airport security checkpoints.

The Members wrote: “We understand that TSA has allowed migrants who do not have acceptable forms of identification to present alternative DHS-issued documents so they can proceed through TSA security screening to board flights. We are extremely concerned that TSA is allowing illegal migrants to use arrest warrants and removal/deportation warrants as valid identification documents to go through airport security screening.” “With crime and illegal migration at record numbers in this country, there is no excuse for this irresponsible and misguided policy. The reliability of these DHS documents for confirming an individual’s identity should never outweigh the risk of allowing unescorted illegal migrants with arrest or removal/deportation warrants to proceed through security checkpoints and board commercial flights without an ICE or other law enforcement escort.

Although it expires in February 2021, the treaty can be extended up to five years by agreement of the U.S. and Russian presidents without requiring further action by Congress or the Duma. Its expiration, without a replacement, would end treaty restrictions limiting the number of deployed strategic warheads on each side to a maximum of 1,550, a target each met this year and that is far below the tens of thousands deployed during the Cold War. (See ACT, March 2018.) “We ought to be a little bit more pro-continuing the benefits the [New] START treaty gives us rather than getting the idea there might be some way we get out of it,” said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) Sept. 18 at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on U.S.-Russian arms control efforts. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly expressed interest in extending the treaty, which was ratified in 2011, although Russia has raised concerns about some of the procedures the United States has used to remove nuclear weapons launchers from accountability under the agreement. The Trump administration has yet to formulate the U.S. position. John Bolton, President Trump’s national security adviser, said that the administration remains in the “very, very early stages” of an interagency review about whether to extend, replace, or jettison New START or to pursue a different type of approach, such as the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, which only limited deployed warheads and did not include verification provisions. (See ACT, September 2018.) Andrea Thompson, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, reiterated at the hearing that the administration is still considering its options. “I know this committee has sought the Trump administration’s view of extending the treaty,” she said. “A decision has not been made at this time.” Thompson added that several issues would have an impact on an extension decision, including “Russia’s decision to manufacture compliance issues regarding U.S. weapons,” whether Russia would agree to limit the new strategic weapons systems Putin boasted about in a March speech, and Russia’s “behavior in other arms control agreements.” In a pre-election address to the Russian Federal Assembly on March 1, Putin boasted about the development of several new nuclear weapons systems, including nuclear-armed hypersonic glide vehicles; globe-circling, nuclear-powered cruise missiles; and very long-range nuclear torpedoes for use against U.S. port cities. (See ACT, April 2018.) Since 2014, the United States has accused Russia of testing and deploying ground-launched cruise missiles in violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and is reviewing what the State Department calls defensive options in case Russia’s actions “result in the collapse of the treaty.” (See ACT, January/February 2018.) Moscow denies it is violating the agreement and instead has accused Washington of breaching the accord. Neither Thompson, nor David Trachtenberg, the deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, would provide their views on what the implications would be if New START were allowed to expire in 2021 with nothing to replace it. Trachtenberg testified alongside Thompson at the Sept. 18 hearing. The testimony from Thompson and Trachtenberg seemed to surprise and trouble some Republican committee members, particularly the question of linking continuation of New START to disputes involving other arms control treaties. Further, administration officials have had little to say publicly about the benefits of New START limitations to restrain the U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals. “My concern is that we could be…saying, “Well, they’re violating the INF [Treaty]…and all these other treaties, and we don’t like all the stuff they’re doing,’ which is true,” said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). “But I worry that we just throw, then, the New START treaty out.” “If the [New] START treaty is being complied with and it’s yielding the benefits to us of not having to have so many nuclear armaments,” committee chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) asked, “we would not consider undoing the [New] START treaty because other treaties are not being adhered to, would we?” Democratic members of the committee also criticized the administration’s position on the agreement and pointed out that their continued support for spending hundreds of billions of dollars to upgrade the U.S. nuclear arsenal hinged on the administration’s support for arms control, including extending New START. (See ACT, December 2017.) “I…want to remind the administration that bipartisan support for nuclear modernization is tied to maintaining an arms control process that controls and seeks to reduce Russian nuclear forces, which inevitably means promoting military and fiscally responsive policies on ourselves,” Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the committee’s ranking member, said. “We’re not interested in writing blank checks for a nuclear arms race with Russia, and we don’t want to step off our current path of stability to wander again down an uncertain road filled with potentially dire consequences.” Corker also acknowledged this linkage, stating that “the modernization piece, and the reduction in warheads piece go hand in hand.” The Arms Control Association depends on the generous contributions of individuals who share our goal of promoting public understanding of and support for effective arms control policies.

The old treaty frameworks won’t work anymore. Then-Vice President Joe Biden and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Russia, in 2012. | AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko Opinion by Eugene Rumer and Richard Sokolsky 02/07/2021 07:00 AM EST Link Copied Eugene Rumer is the director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Richard Sokolsky, currently a nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, was the director of the Department of State’s arms control office from 1990-1997. The arms control community can breathe a sigh of relief now that the United States and Russia agreed on Wednesday to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), the last remaining U.S.-Russian arms control treaty, for another five years. Had the treaty, which limits the deployed strategic nuclear weapons of each country to 1,550, been allowed to expire, there would have been nothing left to limit the size of the two countries’ strategic arsenals. We should enjoy the moment while it lasts, because the version of strategic arms control that has been a major feature of U.S-Russian relations—bilateral, treaty-based, verifiable—is nearing the end of its life. Once the extended New START expires five years from now, there is virtually no chance that another negotiated treaty will be waiting to succeed it. New ways of managing the U.S.-Russian strategic competition are needed to address not only the numerical “balance of terror,” but to also manage new technologies that promise to be far more destabilizing than one side’s mere superiority in strategic nuclear warheads or missiles. The obstacles in the way of progress in arms control are both political and substantive. First, politics. The New START extension was done by executive agreement in accordance with the treaty’s provisions. Any new treaty would have to gain Senate approval by a two-thirds majority. With the 50-50 split in the deeply polarized chamber, getting 17 Republicans to support a new treaty with Russia will be a struggle—and that’s assuming that all Democrats will support another treaty, which is not a foregone conclusion. There are also sound substantive arguments that need to be addressed before any new treaty with Russia can be signed. In 2019, the United States withdrew from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which called for the elimination of U.S. and Russian missiles with ranges of up to 5,500 kilometers, because it established as early as 2014 that Russia had violated it. That finding was endorsed by all U.S. NATO allies. Russia has denied the charge. The INF Treaty is gone, but the question remains: Did Russia cheat, or did the United States and its allies get it all wrong? If it’s the former, why would the United States sign another treaty with a country that has breached a cornerstone of the entire arms-control edifice? If it’s the latter, the United States needs to take a serious look at how it monitors treaties before it signs another. Some in the arms control community argue that because Russia has cheated only on the INF Treaty, but has not cheated on the New START Treaty, which limits longer-range missiles, a new treaty to reduce the latter category of weapons makes sense. That’s like saying that someone can be trusted because he cheats only in poker, but not in blackjack. It is hard to imagine that the U.S. Senate will ratify another arms control treaty of any kind with Russia until the INF controversy is resolved. Russia’s violation of another major—this time multilateral—treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, will likely be another sticking point in negotiations over new treaties in the future. Russian security personnel have used Novichok, a banned nerve agent, in two known assassination attempts in recent years—against Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020 and former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in 2018. Both uses have been confirmed by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. As with its violation of the INF Treaty, Russia has also denied these reports. These controversies, too, will have to be resolved before any administration could win Senate approval for a new arms control treaty. And there is more. The existing U.S-Russian strategic arms-control framework does nothing to limit the arms race in areas that are most threatening and destabilizing to the balance of terror between the United States and Russia. The existing framework limits operationally deployed strategic warheads and delivery vehicles and includes a robust verification regime, which has served both countries well. But it is concerned mostly with numbers, and not qualities, of weapons. Both Russia and the United States are pursuing high-precision long-range conventional weapons and cyber and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities—the kind of weapons whose stealthy and destructive potential matters far more than quantity. New technologies are also blurring the lines between conventional and nuclear weapons, and some cyber and AI capabilities will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to verify. If the U.S.-Russian arms control relationship is to continue and remain meaningful, both sides will need to come up with new approaches beyond negotiated treaties and intrusive verification regimes. After the three post-Cold War decades of unconstrained ambition in U.S. overseas pursuits, a new concept—restraint—is making inroads in the lexicon of U.S. foreign policy. It’s time to apply it to arms control as well and explore its applicability to managing the strategic balance with Russia. There is much conceptual work to be done here on both sides, and there is little evidence that either side is ready to embrace this approach now. But there are precedents in the history of competition between Moscow and Washington going back to the Cuban Missile Crisis, when restraint and quiet mutual concessions not based on any treaty proved pivotal in steering the relationship from the brink of disaster. The United States quietly agreed to withdraw its nuclear-armed missiles from Turkey to get the Soviet Union to remove its missiles from Cuba in 1962. The Reagan Administration observed the limits of the SALT II Treaty in the 1980s even though the United States did not ratify it after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In the same spirit, the United States could refrain from deploying new land-based missiles in Europe that could reach targets deep in the Russian heartland, even though it can do so after the demise of the INF Treaty. There are other unilateral steps the United States could consider. If Russia reciprocates, it could be a step toward a new framework for managing the competition; if not, those steps can always be reversed. With the five-year extension of New START, the United States and Russia got a reprieve to come up with new ways to manage their strategic competition. They should use this time to engage in a no-holds-barred dialogue about their differences and to think boldly and creatively beyond the established framework that is bound to run into the insurmountable twin obstacles of political headwinds and conceptual obsolescence.

The speeches, one at a fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on Wednesday in San Diego and another for the Democratic National Committee on Thursday in San Francisco, are the latest in a string of fundraisers Obama has headlined for top Democratic groups as the former President gets more engaged with the midterms. Obama warns of 'malevolence' aimed at democracy in Democratic fundraiser speech “There’s a lot of mischief that can be done with a Republican House majority,” Obama told donors in San Diego. “So this is not a normal election. The stakes could not be higher. And I hope that everybody understands the stakes in this last quarter. I’m going to be out there talking about it, and I expect all of you to be doing the same.” With Democrats only holding a narrow House majority, Republicans are confident they can win back control of the chamber in November, and with it stepped-up oversight of the Biden administration. Obama has personal experience with this kind of shift: In the midterm elections when he was president, Republicans won control of the House in 2010 and then the Senate four years later. On Thursday, Obama told DNC donors that “over the last four years, our democracy hasn’t worked,” referring to former President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress. “Not only did it not work,” he said, “but we elected somebody who actually didn’t believe in it.” He added: “What we’ve seen the last four years, with a whole bunch of leading figures in one of our two major political parties, is they’re not even faking it. Essentially what they’ve said is that, we fear we may be a minority party, our ideas aren’t selling, but if we can exploit some of the play in the joints of a creaky democracy, if we can work and game the system enough to exploit its anti-majoritarian trends or tendencies, we may be able to just seize power, even if we’re not getting the most votes, even if we’re not marshaling the most support from our population, and if we’re ruthless enough about (it).” A once-bullish GOP now sees a smaller House majority in its future, presenting a challenge to McCarthy Obama said Thursday that this had not always been a Republican viewpoint – he mentioned that his favorite president, Abraham Lincoln, was a Republican and that “the staunchest segregationists were lodged in the Democratic Party.” But Obama said that “right now, it’s pretty clear, we’ve got one party that does have a fundamentally different vision.” Although the focus at each event was the midterms, Obama argued in San Francisco that elections in the United States and around the world extend “beyond any particular issue” and are actually “a contest between those of us who believe in a vision of society in which each individual is treated with equal worth and equal dignity” and an opposing side “that has everything to do with tribe and race and sect and power and violence.” Obama said that while it was a “decade-long project” to reverse “economic trends that have helped popularize a more authoritarian view of how society should be structured,” the key in the meantime was to “make sure that what guardrails remain to maintain our democracy stay in place” and to combat the attacks on the electoral process that have happened in recent years. “What we’re seeing right now is that what used to be sort of vestiges of a poll tax, Jim Crow, voter suppression, which could be overcome, has now escalated to voter nullification,” Obama said. “That’s essentially what ‘Stop the Steal’ is about. It’s what Republican candidates up and down the line are now professing. … Essentially what they’re saying is, ‘We do not have to abide by the norms that we had set up just to count votes.’” Since the 2020 election, a number of Republican-controlled states have moved to reshape their state election systems, moves that have drawn criticism from Democrats. Pelosi won't say if she wants to stay in charge. But will House Democrats let her? Chris Hayden, a DCCC spokesman, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and California Rep. Sara Jacobs joined Obama at the fundraiser on Wednesday at the home of Jacobs’ grandparents, Joan and Irwin Jacobs, the co-founder of Qualcomm. The event, Hayden said, raised $2.75 million. A spokesperson for the DNC said Thursday’s event in San Francisco raised more than $2 million from 60 attendees. Obama heralded Democrats at both events, saying Wednesday that he “watched with extraordinary pride all the work that has been done to build on the work that we started back in 2008.” On Thursday, he said that “a big advantage that we’ve got actually in this upcoming midterm is the quality of our candidates.” Obama has now held fundraisers for several major Democratic groups, including the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in early September and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee in late August. © 2023 Cable News Network.

Some Republican presidential candidates, including former President Donald Trump, are already targeting the IRA's grant and loan spending. | Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo By Hannah Northey and Timothy Cama 08/16/2023 05:55 PM EDT Link Copied President Joe Biden’s signature climate law will soon face a new threat: the 2024 presidential election. The Inflation Reduction Act has so far survived Republican-led attempts on Capitol Hill to repeal major parts of its $369 billion in clean energy and climate spending. But a Republican president like Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis would have multiple avenues for hindering the law through executive action — including by tightening limits on its tax credits, holding back some of its loans and grants, or revising Treasury Department rules that haven’t yet reached the finish line when Biden leaves office. That would likely hurt U.S. efforts to be a world leader on climate change and meet the international commitments that the Obama and Biden administrations have made, and undercut Democrats’ top achievement of recent years. The fight could mirror the years of GOP attacks that Obamacare faced after Congress enacted it in 2010, including multiple repeal attempts and Trump’s use of executive actions to undercut it. Some Republican presidential candidates, including Trump, are already targeting the IRA’s grant and loan spending, which provide a major piece of the federal government’s support for shift to clean energy. “They’re just pouring money out,” Trump told supporters during a rally in New Hampshire this month. “All these crazy deals, this Inflation Reduction Act … it increases inflation.” Nikki Haley slammed the law Wednesday and said she’d repeal it. “The IRA is a communist manifesto filled with tax hikes and green subsidies that benefit China and make America more dependent on Beijing,” she said in a statement. “As president, I will repeal Biden’s green energy handouts and make sure Americans are not dependent on China for vital goods.” Among other options, a GOP president could have the Treasury Department rework the guidance it has issued on the climate law’s tax credits, including contentious mineral sourcing requirements for electric vehicles and their components. The White House’s interpretation of the law has already run afoul of Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chair Joe Manchin’s vision. The West Virginia Democrat, who played a key part in writing the law, agrees with Republicans in saying Biden is doing too much to increase EV sales. “I think any Republican president would roll back or put a stop to the Inflation Reduction Act or significantly stifle it,” said Simon Moores, CEO of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Even so, he said, “That wouldn’t stop the money that’s been deployed to date, including over $130 billion for battery capacity already.” Colin Hayes, a former staff director for Republicans on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee under Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said a Republican president could complicate investments in sectors like EVs and offshore wind. That may be especially true for provisions championed by Democrats that conservatives may consider wasteful or too progressive, such as efforts to use the law to redress social, economic or racial injustices. “The worst-case scenario is that people using Inflation Reduction Act tax credits will only able to use the base credits, and that the energy community adders, the domestic content adders, the low-income community adders — all things putting major horsepower behind clean energy deployment — could effectively go away once guidance and rules are rewritten,” said Hayes, a founding partner at lobbying firm Lot Sixteen. Kevin Book, managing director of ClearView Energy Partners LLC, a research firm, said, “I think there’s a very good chance that some of the provisions could be revisited, reinterpreted by the IRS and Treasury in a differently minded administration.” Book and Hayes still think the climate law will survive. Not only are Democrats mostly unified in defending it, but the IRA is benefiting majority-Republican districts around the country. Since the law was enacted, companies have announced more than $270 billion in capital investments on projects and manufacturing tied to renewable energy and electrification, according to the American Clean Power Association. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) at the Iowa State Fair on Saturday. | Jeff Roberson/AP Photo Still, DeSantis, the Florida governor, earlier this year blocked funding tied to the law in his state, while former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — now running for the GOP presidential nomination — called the law a “mistake” in a Bloomberg TV interview. “They can slow things down, they can tighten criteria,” Jeff Navin, a partner at Boundary Stone Partners and former chief of staff at the Department of Energy, said about a potential Republican president. “There are a few discretionary programs they can refuse to exercise, like the increased authority for loan programs.” Mandy Gunasekara, EPA’s chief of staff under Trump and a conservative energy policy advocate, said a GOP president would ask Congress for changes. But without strong Republican majorities, he or she would have to improvise. The IRA created a $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The law also set up a $3 billion environmental and climate justice program. EPA is in the process of doling out the money. “Any area where the government’s wastefully spending taxpayer money, that’s somewhere a Republican will want to scrutinize and, to the extent possible, cut back,” said Gunasekara. The Treasury Department is still racing to finish guidance for some of the law’s tax incentives, and everything may not be done by Inauguration Day. Any pending work would be ripe for Republican intervention. Some guidance documents may not be completed because of their complexity or because programs aren’t yet scheduled to take effect, such as a credit for technology-neutral net-zero power sources, which will replace the existing wind energy production tax credit and solar energy investment tax credit. “I’d imagine if there is a change in administration, there’d be a freeze on new guidance until the new team came in place, and they could slow-walk that guidance and put in more restrictive or limited guidance,” Navin said. “I’d imagine the Biden team knows there’s this possibility. That’s why they’re prioritizing certain pieces of guidance over others.” Hayes says a main concern is that Republican leaders may simply want to redirect spending away from the IRA to other priorities, rather than undermine it for ideological reasons. “The best thing [the Biden team] can do is to get the implementing rules and guidance finalized in a legally defensible way so companies can march ahead with investments in projects and hiring people to build them,” he said. Republican attempts against the IRA echo how Trump and the GOP tried to both repeal and sabotage the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama and the Democrats’ signature health care law. Trump and Republicans tried in 2017 to repeal most of the law, also known as Obamacare, but failed when then-Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) voted against the effort. “[Trump] was however able to change some of the rules and considerably weaken the law,” said Michael Doonan, a policy professor at Brandeis University. Those actions included cutting funds for outreach to potential enrollees, slashing subsidies to insurers and reducing restrictions on insurance plans. “If there is discretion in some of the funding for environmental projects, the administration could steer these towards projects to more supportive states, to allies in business or to minimize any adverse effect on the fossil fuel industry,” Doonan said of the climate law. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) after a press conference last month on the Inflation Reduction Act's anniversary. | Francis Chung/POLITICO Republican lawmakers have so far been unable to repeal the IRA’s clean energy tax provisions, despite trying a handful of times since they took the House majority in January. The first was H.R. 1, the House GOP’s broad energy policy package, also known as the “Lower Energy Costs Act.” It passed the House in March, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) declared it “dead on arrival” in the Senate, and Biden pledged to veto it. The GOP tried again with its bill to raise the debt ceiling, the “Limit, Save, Grow Act,” the next month. That legislation incorporated H.R. 1 but went even further in targeting the energy incentives in the IRA. Those rollbacks didn’t survive debt ceiling negotiations with the Senate and Biden. Most recently, the House Ways and Means Committee passed the “Build It in America Act,” another attempt to repeal some of the IRA’s energy tax breaks. For now, Navin said, the IRA is the “law of the land” regardless of who wins the White House, and the administration’s ability to shift priorities is limited. “The executive branch doesn’t have the ability to just refuse to spend money for purposes that Congress dictates,” he added. “That’s long-standing, settled law.” Even though Treasury has been working on guidance for tax credits, those incentive structures are written into the law, giving a future administration little wiggle room. “They could restrict the scope, they could structure it in ways that make those tax credits less applicable or less broadly available,” said Navin. “But the tax credits would still exist under law, and taxpayers could still claim them.” Department of Energy headquarters in Washington. | Francis Chung/POLITICO DOE’s loan programs, which got an $11.7 billion boost in the IRA, would be a prime target of a Republican administration. Those programs did not make any new loans or loan guarantees during Trump’s time in office. It would be legal for him to do the same in a second administration. However, DOE got in trouble in 2017 when the Government Accountability Office said the department violated a law against “impoundment” of funds when it tried not to release money under the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy. Trump wanted to scrap ARPA-E but Congress refused, and the administration was forced to change course. Congressional Democrats are banking on the IRA’s broad popularity among Republicans as a safeguard against both a future president and lawmakers. “I think so much of it will be embedded by then, it will be difficult” to roll back, said Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees tax issues. “This will be wildly popular when people see what these tax credits are like. Who’s using them right now? Republicans. Red states,” he said. Illinois Rep. Sean Casten, one of the top Democratic voices on energy and climate, said: “You’ve got a bunch of businesses that are making investments that are predicated on a tax credit that was passed by Congress. You’re going to have a huge fight about that.” House Republicans’ previous repeal attempts show that they might keep trying to undo the IRA. “I just want an all-of-the-above energy approach,” Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) said when asked what he wants a GOP president to do about the IRA. “And so we have to invest in traditional energy and we have to invest in alternative and renewable energy as well.” Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) said, “Let’s get a Republican president first.” Link Copied © 2023 POLITICO LLC", "Boehner says his party's plan for the president's agenda is to 'kill it, stop it, slow it down.\" By Andy Barr 10/28/2010 08:09 AM EDT Link Copied If Republicans take the House as anticipated on election night, voters can expect to hear the customary talk about coming together with Democrats for the good of the country. President Barack Obama inevitably will extend a hand across the aisle as well. But that’s Tuesday. Right now, the tone is a lot different — with Republicans pledging to embrace an agenda for the next two years that sounds a lot like their agenda for the past two: Block Obama at all costs. And even Obama’s pre-election appeals to cooperation are wrapped in an I’m-still-the-president tone that suggests that Americans will be looking at two opposing camps glaring at each other across the barricades — gridlock all around. Here’s John Boehner, the likely speaker if Republicans take the House, offering his plans for Obama’s agenda: “We’re going to do everything — and I mean everything we can do — to kill it, stop it, slow it down, whatever we can.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell summed up his plan to National Journal: “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.” Obama frequently reminds voters he believes all the delay in Washington this year is the Republicans’ fault. “So I hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle are going to change their minds going forward, because putting the American people back to work, boosting our small businesses, rebuilding the economic security of the middle class, these are big national challenges. And we’ve all got a stake in solving them. And it’s not going to be enough just to play politics. You can’t just focus on the next election. You’ve got to focus on the next generation,” Obama said a recent event in Rhode Island. It is popular to compare 2010 with 1994. Pundits point to a rejection of an overreaching Democratic president, a swing of moderate and independent voters to Republican ranks and a grass-roots groundswell that brings dozens of new faces to Washington. But the second part of the prediction foresees that Obama will moderate his goals, Republicans will cool their tone and Washington will be able to responsibly address major issues. Republicans are sounding like they’re not interested in that part. To be sure, some of this is political trash-talk, each side trying to stoke up its partisans in the closing hours of the election. Republicans have premised much of their whole campaign on one idea — stop Obama — and it’s put them on the cusp of taking the House and scoring big gains in the Senate, so there’s no reason to quit now. But veterans of the 1994 takeover are advising both Obama and the GOP to work together over the next two years, arguing that the strategy benefits both sides political and legislatively. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich advised Obama to consult with former President Bill Clinton on how to productively operate with Republicans. Gingrich led a budget fight that culminated in a government shutdown in 1995, but the two sides later were able to pass welfare reform legislation and other compromise measures. “It was painful, it was difficult, and President Clinton did a tremendous job on working with us on balancing the budget and cutting taxes,” Gingrich said on CNN this week. Obama “has an enormous opportunity to be in charge if he listens carefully to the American people and if he operates in the framework of what they want,” Gingrich added. But if Obama’s listening to Republican leadership, he’d hear that he’s not wanted. “To the extent the president wants to work with us, in terms of our goals, we’d welcome his involvement,” Boehner told Hannity. “There will be no compromise on stopping runaway spending, deficits and debt. There will be no compromise on repealing Obamacare,” said Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) in an interview last week on conservative Hugh Hewitt’s radio show. “There will be no compromise on stopping Democrats from growing government and raising taxes,” added Pence, who may leave the House GOP leadership to prepare for a presidential run. And many of the potential incoming Republicans have stated that they wouldn’t budge in trying to meet Democrats halfway. “When it comes to spending, I’m not compromising. I don’t care who, what, when or where, I’m not compromising,” Ken Buck, the Republican Senate nominee in Colorado, told The Washington Post. The White House has indicated that it is willing to reach out to the GOP following the election, though Republicans would contend that its track record suggests otherwise. “I think we’re open to speaking to the Republicans, if they really mean it, if they’re talking about deficit reduction, if they’re willing to move,” Vice President Joe Biden said recently. Polls show that both parties would be wise to reach out. A Bloomberg poll out Thursday shows that 80 percent of likely voters want the two parties to work together over the next two years. And a new New York Times/CBS News poll showed that 69 percent of the public wants to see Obama compromise with Republicans and 72 percent wants congressional Democrats to work with Republicans. Voters were split however when asked if they wanted to see Republicans work with Obama and congressional Democrats. Forty-six percent want to see Republicans work with Democrats, while 45 percent do not.

In previous shutdowns, this led to significant delays and longer wait times for travelers at airports across the country. Additionally, an Extreme Republican Shutdown would halt air traffic controller training—potentially leading to long-term disruptions to the industry at a moment when we’ve seen critical progress filling a backlog of controllers.The reason these transportation priorities are now at risk: extreme House Republicans’ relentless efforts to slash funding for vital programs rather than work in a bipartisan manner to keep the government open and address emergency needs for the American people. House Republicans have turned their backs on the bipartisan budget deal that two-third of them voted for just a few months ago and instead proposed a continuing resolution (CR) that proposes devastating cuts to programs that millions of hardworking Americans count on—including rail safety inspections and the Transportation Security Administration. Their extreme CR also fails to provide the urgent funding President Biden requested to avoid disruptions to FAA air traffic operations. Below is a state-by-state breakdown of the more than 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 TSA Officers who would be forced to work without pay during an Extreme Republican Shutdown: ### We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

Republican legislators prioritize bolstering U.S. deterrence and military capabilities, particularly nuclear weapons, while Democrats emphasize seeking diplomatic solutions and decreasing U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons. The House Republican Policy Committee released a report February 13 declaring that “nuclear weapons and deterrence remain as relevant today as they were at the height of the Cold War.” The lawmakers argued that the threats might have changed from one pre-eminent foe—the Soviet Union—to more disparate and smaller threats—namely, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea—but the value of nuclear weapons in protecting U.S. security remains the same. The report, Differentiation and Defense: An Agenda for the Nuclear Weapons Program, argues that, for nuclear weapons to retain their role as a credible deterrent, the U.S. nuclear weapons complex must be revitalized by halving the time needed to conduct a nuclear test explosion from today’s 24-36 months. It also calls for researching new types of nuclear weapons and modernizing and preserving the nuclear stockpile. In addition, the report recommends that the United States field different types of nuclear weapons to enable it to threaten a variety of targets. As part of this approach, the report calls for research into low-yield warheads—with a yield of five kilotons or less—which has been prohibited by legislation passed in 1993. It also recommends continued research into nuclear warheads for destroying deeply buried and hardened targets. (See ACT, April 2003.) The report touts missile defenses as a key element to dissuade adversaries from investing in illicit weapons programs and dismisses arms control regimes as having limited worth. “The states that are seeking to develop these weapons are largely uninterested in limiting their programs through negotiation or in honoring the agreements they make,” the report asserts. Senate Democrats took an opposite view. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) co-sponsored a resolution March 5 recommending that the United States move “away from the increased reliance on and the importance of nuclear weapons.” Thirty-seven other Senate Democrats and Senator Jim Jeffords (I-VT) have endorsed the initiative. Ten co-sponsors of the resolution also expounded earlier on this theme in a February 21 letter to President George W. Bush urging him not to contemplate using nuclear weapons against Iraq. The resolution calls on the Bush administration to develop a strategy stressing multilateral and bilateral negotiations, including “direct and immediate talks with North Korea,” to strengthen international controls and nonproliferation norms. These Democrats argue that other countries might become more motivated to acquire nuclear weapons if they perceive the United States as assigning expanded roles to nuclear weapons or increasing its willingness to use them. Both the House Policy Committee report and the Democratic resolution offer proposals for frustrating proliferation in progress. Yet, the Republicans call on the United States to rely on its own intelligence and technological capabilities to “overtly and covertly disrupt” proliferation activities, while the Democrats recommend negotiating a “protocol to interdict shipments of such weapons and delivery systems.” Both also professed support for cooperative programs to help Russia protect and eliminate its dangerous weapons and materials. Although the Republican report suggested re-energizing the programs by increasing U.S. private sector participation, the Senate resolution called for increasing U.S. funding as recommended by a January 2001 bipartisan task force, which specified an ideal amount of $3 billion per year. The Bush administration pledged last summer to spend $10 billion over 10 years as part of a Group of Eight initiative. (See ACT, July/August 2002.)

Americans regularly elect the president and Members of Congress. However, difficult-to-fire career employees with entrenched job security—not political appointees who serve at the discretion of the President—perform most federal work. These employees’ jobs do not depend on election outcomes. Career employees thus exercise federal power without adequate transparency and democratic accountability. Most career federal employees honorably serve the American people, diligently following orders and implementing policies of elected officials. However, a significant minority does not. This report documents cases of career bureaucrats resisting Trump Administration policies. Political appointees who served under President Trump reported: Civil service protections enable this policy resistance. They make removing career employees for any reason prohibitively difficult. This is not what the founders of the civil service intended. They wanted to prevent patronage hiring but feared removal protections would protect incompetent or intransigent employees. Thus, after America converted to a merit service, federal employees could not appeal dismissals for over six decades. Federal employee appeals did not arise until the 1940s. Congress should return to the original vision for the civil service and make all federal employees at-will. Removal protections shield career bureaucrats from accountability for how they exercise federal power. Government of, by, and for the people should not operate this way. James Sherk America was founded on the principle of government by consent of the governed. Regular elections keep government leaders accountable to the people. Nonetheless, elected officials rely on career employees to do most government work. These career employees’ jobs do not depend on who wins the election. Many career staff diligently and impartially serve whoever holds office. However, many do not. Many career employees resisted the President’s agenda during the Trump Administration. Interviews with former Trump Administration appointees reveal these employees used similar strategies to stymie the President’s policies. These included: This report documents how hostile career employees utilized these tactics during the Trump Administration. Such bureaucratic resistance undermines the government’s democratic accountability. Americans do not vote for federal career employees. Those employees should not stymie lawful policies elected officials’ support. Current civil service protections help enable this behavior. The law presumes federal employees deserve their jobs. Agencies face a high burden of proof to affirmatively demonstrate that employees deserve dismissal. Employees can then appeal. The entire process can take years. This makes it difficult for political appointees to meaningfully address poor performance or remove intransigent career staff. In FY 2020, agencies removed just one-quarter of one percent of tenured federal employees.[1] The civil service’s founders did not want the government to operate like this. The Pendleton Act that created the civil service did not allow employees to appeal dismissals. Federal employees did not get this ability until the 1940s—six decades after the spoils system ended. To protect America’s democracy, Congress should make federal employees at-will once again. While restrictions on patronage-based hiring are appropriate, agencies should not have to go through a “virtual trial at law” to dismiss an employee. The President should also use his existing constitutional and statutory authorities to make policy-influencing career employees at-will. This would restore the original vision for the civil service. It would also stop intransigent career employees from undermining the democratically expressed will of the people. GOVERNMENT BY CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED In America, governing authority flows, as the Declaration of Independence explains, “from the consent of the governed.” The people elect the president; the president appoints senior agency officials; those officials carry out the law with the assistance of their subordinates. The Constitution thereby gives the American people a role (albeit indirectly) in choosing the officials who govern them (Erickson & Berry, 2019, p.2). However, career employees fill almost all federal positions. Political appointees make up less than 3,800 of the federal government’s approximately 2.2 million civilian jobs (U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 2021; U.S. Government Policy and Supporting Positions, 2020, p. 212).[2] Career employees make up over 99.8 percent of the federal workforce. The President and his appointees necessarily delegate most federal responsibilities to career staff. This delegation stands in tension with the concept of government by the consent of the governed. Career staff keep their jobs irrespective of election results. If the American people do not like the job a cabinet secretary is doing, they can vote against the President who appointed him. Presidents routinely remove underperforming cabinet secretaries for precisely this reason. But voters have no recourse if they do not like the job a career bureaucrat is doing. Career staff keep their jobs no matter who Americans elect. Anthony Fauci, for example, became the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 1984, when Ronald Reagan was President. He kept this powerful position through the subsequent elections of Presidents George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. Voters’ views on Fauci’s performance—approval, disapproval, or indifference—did not affect his tenure. In theory, staffing the executive branch with primarily career employees can be consistent with democratic self-government—if those staff neutrally implement the elected President’s policies. Public administration scholars often espouse this vision of the civil service (Moynihan, 2004). In this framework, career employees are a neutral tool, impartially using their expertise to implement their politically accountable superiors’ directives. In reality, career federal employees are human beings with opinions and wills of their own. Many career employees joined the federal government because they wanted to make a difference. They often feel strongly about how their agencies should operate. Political scientists have long documented that some career staff pursue their policy preferences over and against those of elected officials (Johnson & Libecap, 1994, pp. 156-171). Such behavior undermines the government’s democratic accountability. The author of this report served on the White House Domestic Policy Council from 2017 to 2021. Agency appointees frequently described career staff resistance during his White House tenure. After leaving the White House, the author interviewed numerous political appointees about their time in government. This report documents their experiences with career staff. [3] FAITHFUL PUBLIC SERVANTS It needs to be emphasized that many career employees are faithful public servants. Almost every political appointee interviewed for this report recounted career employees who did their jobs diligently. Many mentioned career staff who worked long hours and weekends to advance urgent priorities, especially during the COVID pandemic. Not a few liberal career employees would provide their perspective and concerns to conservative appointees, then faithfully implement policies political leadership decided on—even if they strongly disagreed. Those employees are a credit to the civil service. Public administration scholars’ vision of career employees setting aside their views to provide neutral expertise is not baseless. Faithful public servants were either a majority or near-majority of career employees in most agencies. However, an antagonistic minority has caused significant problems. And in some agencies—like the Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Rights Division or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)—the vast majority of career staff appeared hostile to Trump Administration policies. Career employees in those agencies treated political appointees not as the representatives of the will of the people but as an occupying army to be resisted. Additionally, many (though not all) non-hostile career staff in agencies dominated by hostile career staff kept their heads down. They knew they could face internal retaliation for helping political appointees implement their agenda. While many career employees are faithful, many others undermine the elected President’s agenda. CAREER FEDERAL EMPLOYEES DISPROPORTIONATELY LIBERAL This problem is exacerbated during conservative administrations. Federal employees are disproportionately liberal and thus are particularly likely to object to a conservative President’s policies. Researchers have repeatedly documented the federal bureaucracy’s liberal lean. One recent study found twice as many registered Democrats as Republicans in the federal workforce (Spenkuch, Teso & Xu, 2021, p. 16).[4] This study found an even larger disparity in the Senior Executive Service (SES), the federal government’s most senior career employees. Democrats outnumber Republicans in the SES by 3 to 1 (Spenkuch, Teso & Xu, 2021, p. 37).[5] Another study examined career employee campaign donations.[6] It revealed that most career federal employees’ campaign donations go to politically liberal candidates (Feinstein & Wood, 2021, p. 25).[7] While there are many conservative federal employees, the federal workforce as a whole stands well to the left of America’s political center. Career staff are even more liberal than Democratic Presidential political appointees in some cases. One political appointee who served at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the George W. Bush and Donald Trump administrations recalled a conversation with a counterpart who served in the same agency under President Bill Clinton. This political appointee had remarked that it must have been easier for his counterpart to work with HHS career staff because they were philosophically aligned. The Clinton administration official replied that managing the career employees was actually quite difficult—the career employees considered him and his fellow Clinton appointees insufficiently progressive “establishment sellouts.” The Clinton official reported that career staff constantly leaked to Congress and the media to pressure political appointees to be more aggressive. CAREER STAFF RESISTANCE Researchers find that when conservatives lead agencies with liberal career staff, those agencies issue fewer policy changes and take longer to issue those changes (Feinstein & Wood, 2021, pp. 30- 37).[8] Similarly, researchers find that career employees are less productive and effective when their political views meaningfully differ from their agency’s political leadership (Spenkuch, Teso & Xu, 2021, pp. 19-27). In some cases, left-wing career staff do not simply obstruct policies they oppose; they actively move policy in the opposite direction than that desired by political appointees (Wood, 1988). Bureaucratic resistance was particularly pronounced during the Trump Administration. While career staff policy opposition usually occurs behind the scenes, it made national news under President Trump. Within two weeks of President Trump’s inauguration, the Washington Post ran an article entitled “Resistance from within: Federal workers push back against Trump (Eilperin, Rein, & Fisher, 2017). Later that year, Bloomberg News reported how “career staff have found ways to obstruct, slow down or simply ignore their new leader, the president” (Flavelle & Bain, 2017). Several political appointees who served in the Trump and Bush administrations reported greater career staff resistance when they served under President Donald Trump than under President George W. Bush. Some federal employees even boasted of their intransigence to each other. For example, President Trump appointed Peter Robb to serve as General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). A Freedom of Information Act request uncovered NLRB regional directors celebrating how their self-described “resistance” stymied Robb’s agenda (Nelson, 2021). While public administration scholars theorize about impartial career staff providing neutral administrative expertise, many federal employees do not approach their jobs that way. THE HOSTILE CAREER STAFF PLAYBOOK Polling shows Americans recognize this. A Monmouth University survey (2018) found 60% of Americans believe unelected officials have too much influence in determining federal policy. But there is much less public awareness of how the bureaucracy exerts its influence. Policy resistance usually occurs behind closed doors, and news reports paint only a partial picture. The former appointees the author interviewed often reported similar experiences; hostile career staff used similar tactics across agencies. This report publicly documents the playbook antagonistic staff used to impede policies they opposed. WITHHOLDING INFORMATION Hostile career staff can obstruct political appointees in many ways. Perhaps the most common tactic is simply withholding information. Career staff have agency-specific expertise. They know many things political appointees need to implement their agenda. Career employees can frustrate that agenda simply by withholding their expertise or knowledge. Hostile career employees did this frequently. When political appointees asked questions, antagonistic staff would provide as little information as possible.[9] They might know where political appointees wanted to go with their questions and how to get there, but they would not volunteer that information. Often, they would only provide information supporting their preferred approach. In other cases, career staff withheld vital information from political appointees entirely. This forced political appointees to waste time gathering information their career employees could have easily provided. For example, political appointees reported that: Career employees refused to turn over the internal documents. They provided various excuses, such as claiming that they did not have the data anymore or the people involved had left. However, ED subsequently had to turn over this evidence during a lawsuit. Career employees then promptly produced memos summarizing the Department’s evidence against the for-profit schools. Those memos showed the Department had a weak case. This intransigence was very frustrating to ED political appointees. ED career staff had precisely the information they were looking for all along, but concealed it until legally required to disclose It. MISREPRESENTING THE FACTS Some career employees went beyond withholding information—they actively misrepresented the facts about what agencies could, or could not, do. Political appointees had to do their own research to determine what actions they could lawfully undertake. For example, political appointees reported: REFUSING IDEOLOGICALLY DISAGREEABLE WORK Career staff are supposed to implement political appointees’ policy directives, regardless of their personal policy views. This is a fundamental obligation for government lawyers. Their profession ethically obligates them to represent their client—the federal government—to the best of their ability, irrespective of their personal views. Many career staff approach their jobs this way. But a significant minority will not work on projects they disagree with. Their attitude is they only do work they believe is good policy, regardless of the administration’s policy views. This approach undermines America’s democracy. Career staff who refuse to enforce laws they personally oppose stop the American people from getting the policies they voted for. Political appointees are meant to manage and supervise career staff’s general operations; they do not have the time to take over routine enforcement actions. Unfortunately, some career employees refuse to enforce laws they disagree with. For example, political appointees reported that: In 2018, political appointees directed the career deputy who ran the EOS to oversee the Yale investigation and move it along. The career deputy did so, despite philosophically disagreeing with the case. Two attorneys from outside EOS were assigned to work on the case. The investigation took much longer than usual despite being a straightforward case. Finally, after two years of investigating, the DOJ uncovered strong evidence of racial discrimination against Caucasians and even stronger evidence of discrimination against Asian-Americans. Political appointees personally drafted a racial discrimination complaint against Yale—a task that junior career lawyers would typically handle. DOJ then needed to assemble a team to pursue the Yale racial discrimination case. Political appointees asked EOS to provide eight lawyers to work on the case. The career staff refused outright, telling political appointees that none of them would work on it. DOJ instead had to assemble a team from outside EOS, primarily made up of employees borrowed from the DOJ Civil Division, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Connecticut (where Yale is located), and the Civil Rights Division’s front office. DOJ had clear evidence of racial discrimination at Yale and a clear legal theory, but no EOS career lawyers would work on the case because it did not support their worldview.[12] Similarly, DOJ sought to protect the rights of girls and young women to compete on a level playing field in high school and college sports. The Civil Rights Division supported parents in Connecticut suing to prevent biological males who identified as women from unfairly competing against girls in track meets and an Idaho law barring biological males from competing against women. The Division’s career staff opposed these efforts, and political appointees performed all related legal work. So while the Civil Rights Division has over 400 lawyers and professional employees, it had only about a dozen lawyers—primarily political appointees—willing to work on certain issues. Political appointees believed these limitations significantly impaired the Division’s effectiveness. DELAYS AND SLOW-WALKING Outright refusing to work on a project can be risky; it gives political appointees legal justification to dismiss career staff who refuse orders. While the removal process is complex and time-consuming, it is possible to remove federal employees who refuse to work.[15] Consequently, even hostile staff typically accept assignments they object to. However, many will then slow-walk the project, taking far longer to complete it than work they supported. Political appointees would frequently find that career staff would take weeks or months to do work that political employees could do themselves in a few days. For example, political appointees reported that: The Cuomo Administration initially reported very low nursing home death rates. DOJ political appointees found these reported figures questionable. They knew New York had a high COVID death rate, and the elderly were particularly vulnerable, so the low reported figures for nursing homes seemed odd. DOJ requested additional data from several states, including New York and Michigan, that required nursing homes to admit individuals with COVID.[17] Civil Rights Division career lawyers tried to block this request. They argued DOJ should request data from states with Republican governors, like Texas and Indiana, based on historical surveys of how well-run nursing homes had been before the pandemic. At the time, Texas and Indiana had far lower death rates than New York State. Political appointees overruled these objections, saying they were only examining how states were currently responding to the COVID pandemic. The Division’s career lawyers dragged their feet and did not draft the letters requesting additional data. Frustrated with the delay, DOJ political appointees drafted the letter and sent it out themselves (Department of Justice, 2020). This action helped to expose the Cuomo Administration’s cover-up of deaths in New York nursing homes. Subsequent investigations showed New York’s official figures underreported nursing home deaths by as much as 50 percent (New York State Office of the Attorney General, 2021). UNACCEPTABLE WORK PRODUCT Hostile career employees can only delay projects for so long. Sufficient delay can become an effective refusal to perform work, which could justify termination. So hostile career staff unwilling to formally refuse an assignment need to ultimately complete it. However, they often then produce unacceptable work product. Draft regulations are complex documents with many legal facets. Sophisticated career staff can draft regulations that formally comply with their directives but are unlikely to withstand judicial review. This allows them to technically complete their assignment—making it harder to dismiss them—while stymieing the administration’s policy objectives. Such obstruction frequently forced political appointees to do work that career staff should have performed themselves. For example, political appointees reported that: LEAKING When internal obstruction does not block an initiative, hostile career staff will often leak to the press or Congress. Political appointees find leaks extremely damaging. While they can work around career obstruction—such as having political appointees do tasks career staff would typically perform—leaks consume enormous amounts of time and attention. They can create a media or congressional firestorm, especially when career staff misrepresents the policies in question. Political appointees must then respond to the resulting inquiries, taking time away that should be spent advancing their policy agenda. Selective leaking is a deliberate career staff tactic to divide political appointees’ time and attention and pressure them to change policy. For example, political appointees reported that: In December 2019, career lawyers at GSA were asked to review an early draft of the order. To avoid leaks, it was not shared with other GSA components. Nonetheless, a copy of that draft appeared in the press in February 2020 (McGuigan, 2020; Make Federal Buildings ‘Beautiful Again’?, 2020). The leak created a media firestorm, with many critics comparing support for traditional architecture to Hitler’s Nazi Germany (Baskin, 2020; Wagner, 2020; Pinto, 2020). GSA subsequently determined that a career lawyer gave a physical copy of the draft to the career chief architect. The chief architect converted it into a PDF using an agency scanner. He then e-mailed it to several external recipients and his personal e-mail account with the subject heading “For your eyes only … for now.” A week later, he resigned in protest. Ironically, the provision that attracted the most criticism—language making classical architecture the default style for all new federal buildings—had already been cut from the working draft before the chief architect resigned.[20] The executive order that President Trump ultimately signed instead eliminated GSA’s institutional bias against traditional architecture while directing GSA to seek community input on new building designs and prioritize designs that non-architects appreciate (Exec. Order 13967). However, the leak made the ultimate executive order controversial. President Biden rescinded it shortly after taking office (Exec. Order 14018). INTRANSIGENCE AND INSUBORDINATION Some career staff went beyond refusing assignments or doing them poorly: they would flatly disregard political appointees’ directions and instead do what they thought best. Such insubordination and intransigence occurred commonly in some agencies and infrequently in others. For example: HIRING IDEOLOGUES INTO CAREER POSITIONS The media often describes career employees as non-partisan. This is only sometimes true. Career staff are typically less partisan than political appointees (Feinstein & Wood, 2021, pp. 25-30). However, agencies often hire partisan ideologues Into career positions. Sometimes political appointees hire fellow partisans into these roles. In other cases, ideological career staff hire like-minded applicants. Either way, ideological career staff make implementing a contrary policy agenda very difficult. Examples political appointees reported of agencies hiring overtly ideological career staff include: These problems remained unchanged in the Trump Administration. Career staff continued to apply superficially neutral hiring criteria that effectively screened out conservative or nonpartisan applicants. Career staff also appeared to “blackball” anyone whose resume indicated they were conservative, even if that was not the stated reason for their not getting hired. At the same time, Civil Rights Division career staff hired many overtly liberal and progressive activists. The Obama DOL similarly appointed the head of New York State’s “Joint Enforcement Task Force on Misclassification” to head the Fair Labor Standards Division of the Solicitor of Labor’s Office. This Task Force sought to reclassify workers as employees instead of independent contractors—a longtime priority of left-wing labor activists. This appointee continued that work for the Obama DOL. She is highly ideological and was functionally an Obama Administration political appointee—but was hired into a powerful career position that she retained throughout the Trump Administration. Trump appointees had to work around her opposition to their policies. This hiring philosophy has been carried into the Biden Administration. The Biden NLRB recently hired a prominent labor law writer for a career position in a regional office (Magner, 2021). This writer has extensively written about how the NLRB could radically rewrite longstanding precedent to boost union organizing. He has called for the Board to prohibit employers from discussing unionization with employees, order employers to bargain with unions their employees did not vote for and give unions authority over businesses’ capital allocation (Magner, 2020). CAREER EMPLOYEE RESISTANCE CHANGES POLICY Career employee resistance changes policy. While political appointees can often work around hostile career staff, career opposition sometimes changes policy initiatives or defeats them outright. This typically happens for one of several reasons. Reducing Policy Bandwidth First, career staff resistance reduces political appointees’ bandwidth. When career staff refuse assignments or produce unusable work product, they force political appointees to implement policy reforms on their own. But agencies do not have enough political appointees to assume all these responsibilities by themselves. Thus, policy resistance forces agencies to triage their agenda, focusing political appointees’ efforts on their highest priorities and leaving tertiary projects undone. Career staff opposition prevented agencies from issuing many rules during the Trump Administration. Political appointees could not delegate these tasks to career employees, and they did not have enough time to do them themselves. Academic research confirms these reports. Researchers find that agencies with hostile career staff issue fewer and less significant regulations (Feinstein & Wood, 2021, pp. 35-37). Running out the Clock Second, hostile career staff can defeat policy changes by running out the clock. Stalling tactics like delays and slow-walking usually just postpone policy changes. However, in some cases—especially in the final year of a presidential term—stalling can block policy changes outright. If a court invalidates a rule for procedural reasons the agency can bring it back in effect by re-doing the rulemaking process and fixing the procedural defect. The first step is to re-publish the proposal in the Federal Register—this time providing adequate notice of the intended final policy. Putting this notice together is a ministerial task; the agency has previously done almost all the work of creating the rule. It must simply republish that proposal with only slight modification. The task generally takes only a few days. After the district court ruled against USDA, political appointees directed the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to publish a revised notice in the Federal Register. Career FNS staff pretended they did not know how to put the notice together. The task should have been done by the summer. Instead, hostile staff dragged the process out for months. Political appointees were preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic and did not have the bandwidth to drive the career FNS team. As a result, the notice was not submitted to the Federal Register in time for USDA to re-do the regulatory process, and the rule was never issued. FNS career staff ran out the clock on the rulemaking process and killed a policy they opposed. The same FNS career staff who dragged their feet on this ministerial task rapidly implemented significant policy changes for the Biden Administration. In the first year of the Biden Administration, FNS expanded food stamp benefits by 30 percent while weakening work requirements for able-bodied adults (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Rescission of Requirements for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents; 2021; Department of Agriculture, 2021a; Department of Agriculture, 2021b). Weakening Legal Defenses Third, career staff can also defeat policy changes by undermining their legal defense. The Administrative Procedures Act (APA) requires agencies to follow technical procedural steps to issue new rules. Courts routinely overturn rules if agencies do not follow these steps. Career staff can undermine policy changes by following APA procedural requirements sloppily. Similarly, career lawyers can undermine policies by defending them poorly in court. Political appointees believed this frequently happened. Legal sabotage was probably the most effective career staff resistance tactic. Agencies typically win about two-thirds of APA challenges to new rules (Barbash & Paul, 2019). However, under the Trump administration, opponents overturned most new rules they challenged in court (Institute for Policy Integrity, 2021).[24] Constraining Procedural Discretion Finally, career staff can change policy outcomes by constraining their agency’s procedural discretion. The APA requires agencies to provide reasoned justifications for policy changes. Career staff can accordingly influence policy by not doing, or only partially doing, the work necessary to provide such justifications. Agencies cannot simply plow through such resistance, as courts frequently overturn regulations that violate this procedural requirement. This tactic can significantly influence policy when agency political appointees lack the time or technical expertise to create APA justifications on their own. Sec. Perdue wanted to set the unemployment floor to 7%—the level Republicans in the House of Representatives supported. USDA needed to find research and studies justifying that decision. Political appointees told career experts to locate the data necessary to support the 7% threshold. USDA career staff made no effort to find or generate that data. Consequently, when it came time to finalize the rule, USDA had to default to the lower 6% threshold (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: Requirements for Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents, 2019). USDA did not have enough evidence in the record to justify the higher rate. Career staff hostility forced USDA to substantially weaken work requirements that were a presidential and secretarial priority. Constructive Red Teaming Not all career staff hostility undermined policy changes. In some cases it improved them. For example, many senior career lawyers in the Department of Labor are very liberal. They argued strongly against several Trump DOL regulations, such as those defining joint employment or clarifying the legal test for independent contracting. In some ways their opposition impeded policy changes; DOL had to involve political staff in the regulation drafting teams to prevent delays or shoddy work product. In other ways, this career opposition was very constructive. Ideologically hostile experts internally critiqued every controversial DOL regulation. These hostile career lawyers provided political appointees with every substantive legal and policy objection their proposals would face. This “Red Teaming”—as political appointees described it—enabled DOL to identify and eliminate legal or policy problems before their rules went public. Political appointees believed that—contrary to staff’s apparent intentions—career employee Red Teaming meaningfully improved DOL’s policymaking. However, the benefits of Red Teaming had its limits. DOL career lawyers opposed and raised legal objections to almost everything political appointees wanted to do. Many of their legal objections were specious and simply masked policy objections. Consequently, political appointees sometimes found it challenging to determine when career staff were raising genuine concerns that needed to be addressed. The problem was not that some career employees personally opposed President Trump’s agenda. Raising concerns was often helpful. The problems came when career employees actively obstructed policies they opposed. CIVIL SERVICE REGULATIONS PREVENT MEANINGFUL ACCOUNTABILITY Federal employees can be terminated for refusing directives or for poor performance. So, in theory, agencies can dismiss intransigent or insubordinate career staff. In practice, civil service protections make dismissing all but the worst employees prohibitively difficult. Civil service rules presume tenured federal employees deserve to keep their jobs.[26] Agencies must prove that good cause justifies dismissal.[27] To establish good cause exists, agencies must collect evidence and navigate procedural steps, such as providing poor performers a “performance improvement period.”[28] They must also demonstrate misconduct warranted removal—and not a lesser penalty—by evaluating that behavior through the twelve Douglas factors.[29] These internal agency procedures typically take five months to one year. [30] Once an agency dismisses an employee, they have multiple options to appeal: These procedures make firing a federal employee a long and challenging process. Between internal agency procedures and external administrative appeals, the process often takes between one and four years—potentially followed by federal court appeals. Moreover, employees can put their supervisor on trial for trying to remove them. Employees facing removal frequently file meritless discrimination or whistleblower retaliation complaints. This forces the supervisor to prove they did not discriminate or retaliate against the employee. Nearly all federal employee discrimination or whistleblower complaints are meritless.[43] The EEOC closed 15,911 federal employee complaints in FY 2019. The government found discrimination occurred in only 175 of these cases (EEOC, 2021, Table B-10). Similarly, the Office of Special Counsel reports it substantiates only about 3 percent of whistleblower reports (2021, p.26).[44] Career staff use frivolous complaints to make dismissals against them harder. They also use the complaints to gain leverage, offering to drop their complaint if the agency agrees not to dismiss them. Firing an employee is also financially risky for agencies. If a removal is overturned, the Back Pay Act (1966) generally requires paying employees back wages they would have otherwise earned. Agencies must also frequently cover any attorney fees, which typically range from between $300 and $900 an hour.[45] As a result, agencies that discipline rogue employees risk massive financial outlays. This happened to the Department of Justice after it disciplined two prosecutors who intentionally withheld exculpatory information from Senator Ted Steven’s defense during his corruption trial (Schuelke, 2011). DOJ suspended—not dismissed—these prosecutors for 55 days. The prosecutors appealed, and the MSPB overturned their suspensions on a technicality. The MSPB also ordered DOJ to pay the prosecutors back wages and $643,000 in attorney fees (Goeke and Bottini v. Department of Justice, 2016). Merit Systems Protection Board surveys show that only two-fifths of federal career supervisors are confident they could remove an employee for serious misconduct. Only one-quarter are confident they could remove a poor performer (2019, pp. 6,15). Political appointees similarly reported it was very difficult to dismiss career employees. They could transfer those employees or move them to a different office. But they said they could almost never remove them.[46] Even if the agency had clear evidence justifying removal, dismissing the employee would typically take too much time and effort. Political appointees provided many instances of career employees who deserved removal but kept their jobs. For example: Eventually, the employee’s supervisors met with her to discuss job duties and performance expectations. The employee responded by amending her existing EEOC complaint to include additional examples of alleged discriminatory treatment. That complaint prevented the EOP from removing or otherwise disciplining this employee, despite her failure to perform her job duties. EOP Human Resources advised that taking any actions against her would add to her case; if she were removed, she could claim it was in retaliation for her EEOC complaint. The EEO complaint protected her from dismissal. The employee eventually retired, but the EEOC was still processing her complaint when the Trump Administration ended. Given these obstacles, agencies rarely dismiss federal employees for any reason. In FY 2020, agencies removed just one-quarter of one percent of tenured federal employees.[49] Civil service procedures shield many federal employees from removal for misconduct, insubordination, and unacceptable performance. REMOVAL PROTECTIONS UNDERMINE VISION FOR THE CIVIL SERVICE The reformers who created the civil service opposed federal employee removal protections. They wanted to create a merit service. They regulated hiring to prevent federal jobs from becoming patronage rewards. But they also feared removal protections would protect incompetent and intransigent employees. As George William Curtis, president of the National Civil Service Reform League and a co-drafter of the Pendleton Act, explained: [I]t is better to take the risk of occasional injustice from passion and prejudice, which no law or regulation can control, than to seal up incompetency, negligence, insubordination, insolence, and every other mischief in the service, by requiring a virtual trial at law before an unfit or incapable clerk can be removed (Frug, 1976, p. 955). For six decades after the end of the spoils system the federal civil service implemented this vision. Civil service rules prevented agencies from rewarding political supporters with career jobs. But they placed only minimal restrictions on removals. Federal employees could not appeal removals until the Second World War. In 1944 Congress passed veterans’ preferences for federal jobs. That legislation also allowed veterans to appeal removals to the Civil Service Commission. This prevented agencies from circumventing veteran hiring preferences through pretextual firings (Frug, 1978, pp. 959-960). The general federal workforce did not get removal protections until the 1960s. By that point veterans made up a large portion of the federal workforce. Allowing only some employees to appeal their removals came to be seen as arbitrary and unfair. So Presidents John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon extended appeals rights to non-veterans too (Frug, 1978, pp. 960-961). Congress codified external appeals in the Civil Service Reform Act (1978), which created the civil service system that largely exists today. Federal employee removal protections are a modern invention that protects entrenched bureaucracy. They also erode the morale of dedicated public servants, making it difficult for agencies to remove poorly performing or intransigent employees. The annual Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey consistently finds that agencies’ failure to address poor performers is one of federal employees’ greatest frustrations (OPM, 2020, pp. 3, 24). The original civil service reformers saw removal protections as undermining a merit service. PROTECTING DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY For the government to be democratically accountable to the people, elected officials must be able to implement their platform and enforce the law. Current civil service procedures weaken this accountability. No one voted for career employees, but they can—and some do—substantially impede policies they disagree with. In some cases, career staff block policy changes altogether, or even refuse to enforce laws they personally oppose. This prevents Americans from getting the government they voted for. The federal government could take two main steps to protect the government’s democratic accountability. First, agencies could hire significantly more political appointees. This would enable politically accountable officials to supervise career staff more extensively. It would also give agencies greater ability to have political appointees drive key priorities and take over tasks—like writing regulations—that some career staff refuse to perform effectively. Career staff intransigence would matter much less if political appointees had more bandwidth to do tasks themselves. Agencies do not need new legislation to hire more political appointees. They have the authority to create as many Schedule C political appointees as they consider necessary, provided the Office of Personnel Management approves (5 C.F.R. §213.3301). Second, Congress could return the federal workforce to at-will employment. Removing employment protections would make career employees much more accountable to the President. They would know that if they attempted to pursue their own agenda instead of the President’s they could be easily removed. This would also return the federal workforce to the reformers’ original vision for the merit service. A return to at-will employment would retain the government’s existing merit-based hiring procedures. It would also maintain rules that prohibit dismissing employees because of their political contributions (or lack thereof). But agencies would enforce those policies themselves; employees could not bring lengthy appeals over dismissals. The merit service operated effectively under similar rules for six decades under the Pendleton and Lloyd-LaFollette Acts.[50] Returning to those policies would protect democratic self-government. If Congress is unwilling to make the federal workforce at-will, the President can make policy-influencing career positions at-will unilaterally. The President has statutory authority to exempt policy-influencing positions from civil service appeals (5 U.S.C. § 7511(b)(2)). Historically this authority has only been applied to political appointees. In late 2020 President Trump signed an Executive Order that also removed employment protections from policy-influencing career staff (Exec. Order 13957). President Biden rescinded this order before it could take effect (Exec. Order 14003), but nothing prevents a future administration from bringing it back. Doing so would make the federal government much more accountable to the American people. CONCLUSION Democracy operates on the principle of government by the consent of the governed. When career employees attempt to prevent elected officials from implementing their agenda, they undermine American democracy. Many federal employees do their best to implement the administration’s policies. Unfortunately, many do not. During the Trump Administration, many career employees refused or defied directives, withheld information, slow-walked projects they opposed, performed unacceptably, and used strategic leaking to undermine the President’s agenda. Some career employees even refused to enforce laws they did not support. Political appointees cannot simply remove intransigent employees. Civil service removal protections make removing federal employees prohibitively difficult. The reformers who created the civil service wanted to avoid patronage hiring, but they also feared removal protections would entrench incompetence and insubordination. Congress can protect American democracy by returning to the original vision for the civil service: merit-based hiring and straightforward removals.

The American Political Science Review, 82(1). 213-234. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1958066 Z Score Table. (n.d.). Z table. http://www.z-table.com/ [1] Author’s calculations based on data released by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. See footnote 49. [2] During the 2021 Presidential transition there were 3,762 executive branch positions available for Presidential appointees, non-career members of the Senior Executive Service, and Schedule C political appointees (U.S. Government Policy and Supporting Positions, 2020, p.212). [3] This report does not identify political appointees interviewed by name in order to protect sources. However, these appointees are known by the author to have served in senior policymaking positions in the Trump administration. In many cases they recounted examples of policy resistance that the author heard contemporaneously while serving in the White House. [4] The study found that in 2019 approximately 50 percent of career federal employees were Democrats, while 26 percent were Republicans. [5] The study found about two-thirds of SES employees are Democrats, compared to slightly more than one-fifth who are Republican. [6] This study used data on campaign contributions between 1979-2014 from the Database on Money, Ideology in Politics. This database calculates a “CF score” that indicates how liberal or conservative political donors are based on the candidates they donate to. For example, a donor who gave exclusively to Republicans would be ranked as more conservative than most donors, and a donor who gave exclusively to Democrats would be ranked as more liberal. Further, a Republican donor who gave to prominent conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) would be ranked as more conservative than one who gave to moderates like Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI). Similarly, a Democratic donor who gave to overtly socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) would be ranked as more liberal than one who gave to moderates like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) or Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX). [7] CF scores are normalized to be mean zero with a standard deviation of one. Feinstein and Wood (2021, p. 25) report that the average career federal employee’s CF score over the 1979-2014 is -0.560. Applying a Z-score table shows that an individual 0.56 standard deviations to the left of a normalized population mean is to the left of 71.33 percent of the overall population (Z Score Table, n.d.). This means the average federal employee gave to more liberal candidates than 71 percent of all campaign donors did. [8][8] Regulation in this context refers to a formal change in agency rules required to go through the Administrative Procedures Act’s notice-and-comment process. APA rulemaking is required for both regulatory and deregulatory actions. Career staff opposition does not simply make it harder for agencies to increase regulatory burdens, but also to promulgate regulations that reduce regulatory burdens. [9] Throughout this report the term “political appointees” is used to describe reports from officials at specific agencies, regardless of whether the author spoke to one or multiple former officials at such agency. This approach is used to help protect the confidentiality of the author’s sources. [10] For example, NLRB career staff would present decisions the NLRB made under the Obama administration overturning 50 or more years of prior precedent as settled law and would not present cases or precedents the NLRB made under previous administrations coming to different conclusions. [11] PACER is an acronym for Public Access to Court Electronic Records. It provides electronic access to U.S. federal court documents, such as filings and court orders in ongoing judicial proceedings. [12] The Biden administration dismissed this case against Yale shortly after taking office, but a coalition of Asian-Americans are pursuing a similar case through private litigation. [13] Additional examples include only one Civil Rights Division career lawyer being willing to work on letters warning state and local governments that the First Amendment prohibits them from applying more stringent COVID restrictions to places of worship than to similarly situated secular facilities. [14] The Church Amendments were named after their principal sponsor, Sen. Frank Church (D-ID), and are codified at 42 U.S.C. § 300a-7 et seq. The Church Amendments depend on federal enforcement as they do not contain a private right of action that would allow hospital employees to file suit on their own behalf. [15] Under 5 U.S.C. § 7513(a) federal employees may be removed for such cause as will improve the efficiency of the service. Refusal to perform their duties constitutes one such cause. [16] E.g. Notices of Proposed Rulemakings (NPRM) and Final Rules. Such rules can be either regulatory or deregulatory actions. [17] These states were New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. [18] This proposal would exclude NEPA review when the federal government’s sole action involved guaranteeing the loan and, if necessary, making the lender whole and selling the underlying asset. It kept NEPA review when USDA itself was making the loan. [19] The U.S. Federal Court House in Salt Lake City, Utah is another example. GSA career staff selected the architect and gave him broad discretion to choose his preferred design, while giving little input to the local community. Locals now derisively refer to this courthouse as a “Borg Cube” or a “gigantic air conditioning condenser” (SLC Weekly). [20] The final executive order made classical architecture the default style for the District of Columbia, rather than nationwide. [21] Another example of this phenomenon frequently occurred in litigation. Regional directors would not make the legal arguments in cases that headquarters instructed them to make. [22] President Biden designated Peter Ohr as acting general counsel shortly after taking office. [23] The Administrative Procedures Act and associated caselaw generally requires agencies to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) and give the public an opportunity to comment before finalizing regulatory changes. To finalize the rule agencies must give a reasoned response to the arguments the commentators make. Agencies can modify the final regulation in response to comments, but any changes must be a “logical outgrowth” of the initial proposal. Agencies cannot make changes in the final rule that commentors could not have logically foreseen from the initial NPRM. In this case the federal judge held that the changes USDA made between the NPRM and final rule were significant enough that the agency needed to give the public an opportunity to comment on them before implementing the final rule. [24] The Trump administration litigation loss rate was also attributable in part to opponents filing suit in jurisdictions with activist liberal judges appointed by Democratic presidents (e.g. California and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals). Democratic appointees ruled against the Trump administration almost 85 percent of the time (Institute for Policy Integrity, 2021). The Supreme Court frequently overturned these decisions on appeal. See for example Trump v. Hawaii (2018), Trump v. Sierra Club (2019), and Department of Homeland Security v. New York (2020). [25] The regulations allowed states to waive work requirements for counties with unemployment rates 20% or more above the national average (7 CFR § 273.24(f)(3)(iii)). This relative definition meant that the threshold for waiving work requirements fell in tandem with the national unemployment rate. As the national economy improved this waived work requirements in many counties with low unemployment rates. For example, the national unemployment rate in 2018 and 2019 fell below 4%. The USDA standards meant any county with unemployment above 4.8% (20% higher than 4%) qualified for work requirement waivers. However, 4.8% is below what economists historically considered the natural rate of unemployment (approximately 5.5%). [26] Federal employees initially serve a probationary period of one year in most agencies, and, until 2023, two years at the Department of Defense. During this probationary period employees effectively serve at will and agencies do not have to justify their dismissal. [27] Agencies can use two primary authorities to remove tenured employees: Chapter 43 and Chapter 75. Chapter 43 can only be used to remove employees for unacceptable performance. Agencies must demonstrate that “substantial evidence” shows the employee performed unacceptably (5 U.S.C. § 7701(c)(1)(A)). Agencies can use Chapter 75 authority to remove employees for “such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service” (5 U.S.C. § 7513(a)). This has been interpreted to cover removing employees for both poor performance and misconduct. Agencies using Chapter 75 authority must demonstrate that the “preponderance of the evidence” justifies removal (5 U.S.C. § 7701(c)(1)(B)). [28]Before removing an employee for unacceptable performance under Chapter 43 agencies must give the poor performer an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, colloquially known as a performance improvement period or “PIP (5 U.S.C. § 4302(c)(6)). If the employee continues to perform unacceptably at the end of their PIP, or the employee improves but relapses to an unacceptable level within 12 months, the agency may remove them. To do so the agency must first give the employee 30 days advance notice, informing the employee they intend to dismiss them and providing them an opportunity to respond. The agency must issue a decision within 30 days of the conclusion of the notice period (5 U.S.C. § 4303). Agencies using Chapter 75 authorities do not need to provide employees with a PIP. They do need to provide the 30-day advance notice period during which the employee may respond to the charges against them. The agency may remove the employee after considering the employees’ response and weighing the evidence (5 U.S.C. § 7513). [29] The Douglas factors are named after the seminal MSPB case establishing this framework, Douglas v. Veterans Administration (1981). The Douglas factors include the relationship of the infraction to the employee’s responsibilities, the notoriety of the offense, consistency with discipline for similar infractions in the agency, the possibility of rehabilitation, the workers’ disciplinary and work records, mitigating circumstances such as unusually high job tensions, and the efficacy of alternative punishments in deterring future misconduct. Managers must show they carefully evaluated each of the Douglas factors before proposing to remove an employee. If they do not the MSPB may reduce the penalty upon appeal. [30]The Government Accountability Office (2015, p.15) estimates it takes 6 months to 1 year to remove an employee for unacceptable performance using Chapter 43 procedures. Chapter 75 based removals for poor performance or misconduct take approximately 5 months. Agencies typically spend about three months gathering evidence to support a proposed removal. They must then provide the employee with 30 days advance notice of their proposed removal, during which time the employee can respond to the charges against them (5 U.S.C. § 7513(b)(1)). Agencies can dismiss the employee at any point after the conclusion of the advanced notice period and the employee’s response; 30 days is a not atypical response period. [31] Employees in some national security relevant agencies (e.g. the FBI or Central Intelligence Agency) generally do not have MSPB appeal rights. [32] The MSPB holds that: Where the Board sustains an agency’s charges, it will defer to the agency’s penalty determination unless the penalty exceeds the range of allowable punishment specified by statute or regulation, or unless the penalty is so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion. That is because the employing agency, and not the Board, has primary discretion in maintaining employee discipline and efficiency. The Board will not displace management’s responsibility, but instead will ensure that managerial judgment has been properly exercised (citations omitted) (Saiz v. Dep’t of Navy, 2015). [33] The MSPB can mitigate penalties for actions taken under Chapter 75 (for either performance or misconduct) but cannot mitigate performance-based actions taken under Chapter 43. [34] The MSPB (2021, p. 12) reports it took an average of 102 days in FY 2020 to process initial appeals. The MSPB has not had a quorum since January 2017, and so MSPB headquarters not been able to process appeals of initial decisions since then. Prior to the MSPB losing its quorum the Board (2017, p. 15) reported that it took an average of 185 days for MSPB headquarters to review initial decisions. Thus it takes the MSPB an average of about 287 days to adjudicate appeals. [35] 5 U.S.C. § 7703(b) Employees to appeal adverse MSPB decisions to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. 5 U.S.C. § 7703(d) allows only the director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)—not the agency—to seek judicial review of an MSPB order if the OPM director determines “that the Board erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management and that the Board’s decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive.” Agencies cannot otherwise appeal MSPB decisions ordering employees reinstated. [36] The Office of Personnel Management reports that federal unions represented 1.3 million federal employees in 2019 (U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 2019, p. A7). OPM also reports the federal government employed 2.1 million civilian employees that year (n.d.). These figures exclude Postal Service employees. [37] Chapter 71 of title 5 leaves the selection of arbitrators to unions and agencies to negotiate. CBAs typically require the parties to jointly select an arbitrator from a list of potential arbitrators supplied by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. [38] See the concurring opinion of Member Abbott in Department of Labor, Office of Workers' Compensation and American Federation of Government Employees (2021). [39] Arbitral awards in removal proceedings are subject to judicial review in the same manner as decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board (5 U.S.C. § 7121(f)). [40] Federal employees can also appeal their dismissal on the grounds it was discriminatory before a grievance arbitrator and the MSPB. [41] The EEOC FY 2019 Annual Report on the Federal Workforce shows that, government-wide, EEO complaints closed in FY 2019 took an average of 587.3 days to process from the date they were filed. Complaints that proceeded to a final order from an administrative judge were processed in an average of 1,006.9 days (EEOC, 2021, Table B-10). [42] See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–16(c), which allows federal employees and applicants for federal employment to appeal adverse EEOC decisions to federal court, but does not similarly allow agencies to appeal decisions they lost. See also Laber v. Harvey (2006), where the 4th circuit explained agencies have no right to obtain judicial review of EEOC OFO decisions. [43] Genuine employment discrimination or whistleblower retaliation is of course abhorrent. [44] Table 5 in the Office of Special Counsel’s FY 2020 Annual Report to Congress (2021) shows that OSC received a cumulative 12,239 whistleblower disclosures between FY 2013 and FY 2020. After investigation, those disclosures were substantiated in only 396 of those cases—3 percent. [45] Back Pay Act attorney fee awards often use the Laffey attorney fee matrix (Laffey Matrix, n.d.). Hourly Laffey rates range from $400 to $900 an hour, depending on the attorney’s experience. [46]Some political appointees reported firing career employees for poor performance or misconduct. Those appointees reported this took a lot of time and effort. [47] Employees could access their e-mail accounts without using the VPN. [48] The Douglas factors include the employee’s past disciplinary record and the employee’s past work record. [49] In most agencies the probationary period is one year, but it is two years at the Department of Defense (which accounts for over one-third of the Federal, non-postal workforce). FedScope data cubes, maintained by the Office of Personnel Management (n.d.), show that agencies removed 3,939 permanent full-time employees with at least two years of service for performance or misconduct in FY 2020. This represents approximately one-quarter of one-percent of the 1.6 million permanent full-time Federal employees with at least two years of service OPM reports the executive branch employed during this period (n.d.). [50] For more on the history of the civil service see Sherk (2021). The Pendleton Act of 1883 placed considerable restrictions on the hiring process to ensure merit-based hiring. But it placed almost no restrictions on the dismissal process. Rather it made discharging employees based on their political contributions a misdemeanor. The Attorney General could bring charges to enforce the law, but individual employees had no right to appeal or otherwise contest their removal. Under the Lloyd-LaFollette Act of 1912 agencies had to provide a legitimate reason for an employee’s dismissal, and the employee had a right to respond, but the agency’s subsequent determination to retain or discharge the employee was final—the law gave them no right to appeal. Rather, the Lloyd-LaFollette Act expressly provided agencies were not required to justify dismissals in trial-like proceedings.

These refined carbs may contribute to high blood sugar and overeating. Not all carbs are the same. Many whole foods that are high in carbs are incredibly healthy and nutritious. On the other hand, refined or simple carbs have had most of the nutrients and fiber removed. Eating refined carbs is linked to drastically increased risk of many diseases, including obesity, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Almost every nutrition expert agrees that refined carbs should be limited. However, they are still the main source of dietary carbs in many countries. This article explains what refined carbs are, and why they are bad for your health. Refined carbs are also known as simple carbs or processed carbs. There are two main types: Refined carbs have been stripped of almost all fiber, vitamins and minerals. For this reason, they can be considered as “empty” calories. They are also digested quickly, and have a high glycemic index. This means that they lead to rapid spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels after meals. Eating foods high on the glycemic index has been linked to overeating and increased risk of many diseases (1, 2). Sadly, sugars and refined grains are a very large part of the total carbohydrate intake in many countries (3, 4, 5). The main dietary sources of refined carbs are white flour, white bread, white rice, pastries, sodas, snacks, pasta, sweets, breakfast cereals and added sugars. They are also added to all sorts of processed foods. Refined carbs include mostly sugars and processed grains. They are empty calories and lead to rapid spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels. Whole grains are very high in dietary fiber (6). They consist of three main parts (7, 8): (Image from SkinnyChef). The bran and germ are the most nutritious parts of whole grains. They contain high amounts of many nutrients, such as fiber, B vitamins, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese and selenium. During the refining process, the bran and germ are removed, along with all the nutrients they contain (9). This leaves almost no fiber, vitamins or minerals in the refined grains. The only thing left is rapidly digested starch with small amounts of protein. That being said, some producers enrich their products with synthetic vitamins to make up for some of the loss in nutrients. Whether or not synthetic vitamins are as good as natural vitamins has long been debated. However, most people will agree that getting your nutrients from whole foods is always the best choice (10). Diets high in refined carbs also tend to be low in fiber. Low-fiber diets have been linked with an increased risk of diseases like heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, colon cancer and various digestive problems (11, 12, 13). When grains are refined, almost all the fiber, vitamins and minerals are removed from them. Some producers enrich their products with synthetic vitamins after processing. A large portion of the population has overweight or obesity. Eating too many refined carbs may be one of the main culprits (14, 15). Because they are low in fiber and digested quickly, eating refined carbs can cause major swings in blood sugar levels. This can contribute to overeating (16). This is because foods high on the glycemic index promote short-term fullness, lasting about one hour. On the other hand, foods that are low on the glycemic index promote a sustained feeling of fullness, which lasts about two to three hours (2, 17). Blood sugar levels drop about an hour or two after eating a meal high in refined carbs. This promotes hunger and stimulates parts of the brain associated with reward and craving (18). These signals make you crave more food, and are known to cause overeating (16). Long-term studies have also shown that eating refined carbs is linked with increased belly fat over the course of five years (19, 20). Furthermore, refined carbs may cause inflammation in the body. Several experts have speculated that this may be one of the primary dietary causes of leptin resistance and obesity (21, 22). Refined carbs cause rapid spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, and only make you feel full for a short time. This is followed by a drop in blood sugar, hunger and cravings. Heart disease is incredibly common, and currently the world’s biggest killer. Type 2 diabetes is another very common disease, affecting about 300 million people worldwide. People with type 2 diabetes have a high risk of developing heart disease (23, 24, 25). Studies show that a high consumption of refined carbs is linked with insulin resistance and high blood sugar levels. These are some of the main symptoms of type 2 diabetes (14, 26, 27). Refined carbs also increase blood triglyceride levels. This is a risk factor for both heart disease and type 2 diabetes (28, 29, 30, 31). One study in Chinese adults showed that over 85% of the total carbohydrate intake came from refined carbs, mainly white rice and refined wheat products (32). The study also showed that people who ate the most refined carbs were two to three times more likely to get heart disease, compared to those who ate the least. Refined carbs may increase blood triglycerides, blood sugar levels and cause insulin resistance. All of these are major risk factors for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Eating a lot of refined carbs can have many negative health effects. However, not all carbs are bad. Some carbohydrate-rich, whole foods are extremely healthy. These are great sources of fiber, vitamins, minerals and various beneficial plant compounds. Healthy carb-rich foods include vegetables, fruit, legumes, root vegetables and whole grains, such as oats and barley. Unless you are following a carb-restricted diet, there is absolutely NO reason to avoid these foods just because they contain carbs. Here is a list of 12 high-carb foods that are incredibly healthy. Whole foods that contain carbs tend to be incredibly healthy. These include vegetables, fruits, legumes, root vegetables and whole grains. For optimal health (and weight), try to get the majority of your carbs from whole, single ingredient foods. If a food comes with a long list of ingredients, it is probably not a healthy carb source.

OUR BRANDS", "How do carbohydrates affect your cholesterol, specifically the triglycerides? The liver lies at the nexus of metabolism and nutrient flow, particularly carbohydrates and proteins. Situated immediately downstream from absorptive surface of the intestines, those nutrients enter the blood in the portal circulation and pass directly to the liver. The major exception is dietary fat, which is absorbed as chylomicrons directly into the lymphatic system where it empties into the bloodstream without first passing the liver. As the major organ responsible for storing and distributing energy, it is naturally the main site of action of the hormone insulin. When carbohydrates and proteins are absorbed, insulin is released from the pancreas. It travels in the portal vein, heading expressly to the liver. Concentrations of glucose and insulin are often 10 times higher in the blood of portal system and liver compared to the rest of the body and the systemic circulation. Insulin promotes storage of food energy for later use. This is crucial in the survival of the species, since food is not constantly available. We must be able to store enough food to survive the periods of famine inherent in human history. In the liver, glucose molecules from dietary carbohydrates are strung together in long chains to form the molecule glycogen. For a quick energy boost, glycogen can easily be broken back down into its component glucose molecules. Dietary protein is broken down into its component amino acids upon intestinal absorption. Some amino acids are required for make new proteins and overall protein turnover. However, any excess cannot be stored directly. These must be transformed into glucose at the liver before being stored as glycogen. Dietary fat, because it does not require liver processing, does not require insulin. In response to ingestion of dietary fat, there is minimal insulin secretion. Glycogen is the preferred storage form of glucose since it is easily accessible. However, there is limited storage room available inside the liver. Glycogen is analogous to a refrigerator. Food brought into the house is easily placed into and taken out of the refrigerator. However, it can only hold a certain amount of food. Once full, excess glucose needs a different storage form. The liver transforms this glucose into newly created molecules of triglycerides, also known as body fat. This process is called De Novo Lipogenesis (DNL). ‘De Novo’ means ‘from new’, and ‘lipogenesis’ means fat creation. So, DNL means literally, the making of new fat. It is left unsaid that this newly created fat is made from the substrate glucose, not dietary fat. This distinction is important because fats made from DNL are highly saturated, leading to confusion. Eating excessive carbohydrates can lead to an increase in saturated fat levels in the blood. When needed, the triglyceride molecule from body fat can be broken into three fatty acids which most of the body is able to use directly for energy. Compared to glycogen, it is a much more cumbersome process of converting fat to energy and back again. However, fat storage provides the unique advantage of unlimited storage space. This body fat is analogous your basement deep freezer. While it is more difficult to move food into and out of your freezer, you may store larger amounts. There is also room to buy a second or third freezer in the basement if needed. These two forms of storage fulfil different and complementary roles. Glycogen (fridge) is easily accessible, but limited in capacity. Body fat (freezer) is hard to access, but unlimited in capacity. There are two main activators of DNL. The first is insulin. High dietary intake of carbohydrates stimulates insulin secretion and also provides the substrate for DNL. The second main factor is excessive dietary fructose. With DNL running at full production, large amounts of new fat are being created. But the liver is not the appropriate place to store this new fat. The liver should normally only contain glycogen. What happens to all this new fat? First, you could try to burn this fat for energy. However, with all the available glucose around after the meal, there is simply no reason for the body to burn the new fat. Imagine that you have gone to Costco and simply bought waaayyy too much food to store in your refrigerator. One option is to eat it, but there’s simply too much. If you cannot get rid of it, much of the food will be left on the counter where it will rot. So this option is not viable. The only option left is to transfer this new created triglyceride somewhere else. This is known as the endogenous pathway of lipid transport. Triglycerides are packaged together with special proteins called very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). These packages can now be exported out to help decompress the congested liver. The amount of VLDL produced mostly depends upon the availability of hepatic triglycerides. Lots of newly created fat triggers production of more of these triglyceride filled VLDL packages. Insulin plays a key facilitating role in the production of VLDL, by increasing the genes needed for DNL. Experimental infusion of large amounts of carbohydrates increases the release of VLDL from the liver by a massive 3.4 fold. This massive increase in triglyceride rich VLDL particles is the major reason for an increased plasma triglyceride level, detectable in all standard blood test for cholesterol. Excessive DNL can overwhelm this export mechanism resulting in the abnormal retention of this new fat in the liver. As you stuff more and more fat into that liver, it becomes noticeably engorged and can be diagnosed on ultrasound as fatty liver. Once released from the liver, the VLDL particles circulate through the bloodstream. The hormone lipoprotein lipase (LPL), found in the small blood vessels of muscles, adipocytes and heart, breaks down the VLDL. This releases the triglycerides and breaks it into fatty acids, which can be used directly for energy. As VLDL releases triglycerides, the particles become smaller and denser, called VLDL remnants. These are reabsorbed by the liver again and released as low-density lipoproteins (LDL). This is measured by standard blood cholesterol panels and is classically considered the ‘bad’ cholesterol. High carbohydrate diets increase VLDL secretion and raise blood triglyceride levels by 30-40%. This phenomenon is called carbohydrate-induced hypertriglyceridemia and can occur with as little as five days of high intake. Similarly, increased intake of fructose has been linked to hypertriglyceridemia. Dr. Reaven described hyperinsulinemia’s starring role in causing high blood triglycerides in 1967 accounting for 88% of the variability. Higher insulin levels produce higher blood triglyceride levels. Therefore, it is no surprise that reducing dietary carbohydrates and fructose effectively lowers blood triglycerides. The landmark DIRECT study showed that the Atkins-styled diet reduced triglycerides by 40%, compared to only an 11% reduction in the low fat group. — Jason Fung Low Carb for Beginners Intermittent Fasting for Beginners How to Reverse Type 2 Diabetes Does Eating Extra Fat Make You Fat?

Sugar is a type of carbohydrate, which is a source of energy for the body. Both adults and children may experience health problems in later life if they consume too much sugar in their diet. However, a person can reduce sugar intake for a healthier diet. This article explores the connection between sugar and cholesterol. It discusses what cholesterol is and the effects of sugar consumption on both good and bad cholesterol. It also explains how a person may manage sugar intake and when to contact a doctor. Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article will use the terms “male,” “female,” or both to refer to sex assigned at birth. Click here to learn more. Cholesterol is a fatty molecule and steroid essential for health, as it plays several important roles within the body. One crucial function of cholesterol is providing structural integrity to cell membranes and managing their fluidity, which helps to control how proteins and lipids, or fats, move within the membrane. That said, cholesterol is also important for other reasons. For instance, the body can use cholesterol to synthesize molecules such as vitamin D, alongside a range of steroid and sex hormones. Additionally, cholesterol in bile salt allows the digestive system to extract fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamins A, D, E, and K. Scientists divide cholesterol into two types: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. People sometimes call the former “bad” cholesterol and the latter “good” cholesterol. This is because people who have higher amounts of LDL cholesterol may be at an increased risk of developing serious medical conditions such as coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysms, and stroke. In contrast, people with higher amounts of HDL cholesterol are less at risk of developing these conditions. It may be helpful for a person to lower their LDL cholesterol levels and increase their HDL cholesterol levels. Since different foods have different effects on cholesterol levels, maintaining a balanced diet is important for managing cholesterol levels.

There are different types of sugar that occur naturally and others that people chemically refine. Many people use sugar as a food sweetener and preservative, but it also affects cholesterol levels in the body. This section discusses the effects of refined sugars on cholesterol levels. According to a 2016 medical review, as sugar intake increases, LDL cholesterol levels go up, whereas HDL cholesterol levels go down. This is especially true of some sugars, such as refined fructose or sucrose, as opposed to other sugars, such as glucose. Furthermore, the researchers of a 2020 study suggested that replacing fructose or sucrose with starch may lower LDL cholesterol levels. Starch is a complex carbohydrate made up of glucose. Scientists have observed similar effects in children. For instance, a 2021 study investigated the effects of added sugar intake on 8-year-old children. The researchers found a significant decrease in HDL cholesterol levels in children who consumed higher amounts of dietary sugar. However, a 2022 review of scientific research found that consuming low levels of added dietary sugar has minimal effects on long-term LDL and HDL cholesterol levels. However, the researchers noted that further studies into this topic are necessary. People who are concerned about their cholesterol levels may not need to cut added sugars out of their diet completely. However, reducing their added sugar intake may be beneficial. There is some debate about how much sugar adults can healthily consume on average, as the amount varies between individuals. However, according to the American Heart Association, adult females should consume no more than 25 grams (g) of added sugar per day, and adult males should consume no more than 36 g of added sugar per day. Some scientists estimate that, on average, people in the United States consume between three to six times that amount. Therefore, many Americans are at risk of developing several health conditions that have a link to high sugar consumption, including: People can replace added sugars with other sources of energy. These might include natural sources of unrefined sugar, such as fruits and vegetables. People should speak with a healthcare professional for further advice about how to modify their diet safely. A doctor can diagnose elevated LDL cholesterol levels or hypercholesterolemia. This condition can cause the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, which can lead to an increased risk of: Anyone who is concerned about their cholesterol levels should speak with a doctor. A doctor can offer further advice about lowering cholesterol intake and perform tests to determine if a person has healthy cholesterol levels, if necessary. If a person has high levels of LDL cholesterol and low levels of HDL cholesterol, they may be at risk of serious health problems. Eating too much added sugar can lead to this imbalance of cholesterol levels. People may consume too much sugar from a young age. However, a person can reduce their dietary sugar intake. A healthcare professional can help a person manage their diet and lower LDL cholesterol levels.

Fat is an important part of your diet, but some kinds are healthier than others. Find out which to choose and which to avoid. Dietary fat is the fat that comes from food. The body breaks down dietary fats into parts called fatty acids that can enter the bloodstream. The body also can make fatty acids from the carbohydrates in food. The body uses fatty acids to make the fats that it needs. Fats are important for how your body uses many vitamins. And fats play a role in how all cells in the body are made and work. But all dietary fats are not the same. They have different effects on the body. Some dietary fats are essential. Some increase the risk for disease, and some help prevent disease. Find out how different dietary fats affect your body and how to choose foods with healthier fats. There are two main kinds of dietary fats: saturated fat and unsaturated fat. These terms describe the chemical makeup of the fatty acids. Most foods have a mix of different kinds of fat. But some have higher levels of saturated fats, and others have higher levels of unsaturated fats. Key differences in fats include the following: The Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest that less than 10% of calories a day should be from saturated fats. The American Heart Association suggests a goal of 5% to 6% of daily calories from saturated fats. Foods high in saturated fats include: Saturated fats can add up quickly in foods that combine ingredients. In U.S. diets, the most common sources of saturated fats are sandwiches, burgers, tacos and burritos — foods that usually combine meat and dairy products. Baked goods with butter, full-fat ice cream and other desserts are also common sources of saturated fats. Saturated fat tends to raise levels of cholesterol in the blood. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is called \"bad\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is called \"good\" cholesterol. Saturated fats raise the levels of both. A high level of bad cholesterol in the bloodstream increases the risk heart and blood vessel disease. Limited evidence suggest that saturated fats and high cholesterol levels may be linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease or other diseases that cause dementia. Monounsaturated fats are found in many foods, including red meats and dairy products. About half the fats in these foods are saturated and half monounsaturated. Many plants and plant oils are high in monounsaturated fats but low in saturated fats. These include: Monounsaturated fats from plants may lower bad cholesterol and raise good cholesterol. They also may improve the control of blood sugar levels. Replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated fats in the diet may lower the level of bad cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. Triglycerides are fat cells that circulate in the bloodstream and are stored in the body’s fat cells. A high level of triglycerides in the blood increases the risk of diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Eating plant foods high in monounsaturated fats, particularly extra virgin olive oil and tree nuts, may benefit heart health and blood sugar regulation. The two categories of polyunsaturated fats are omega-6 fatty acids and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-6. Sources of omega-6 fatty acids include: Benefits of a diet high in omega-6 fatty acids, especially when they replace saturated fats, may be linked to: Omega-3. Sources of omega-3 fatty acids include oily fish, seeds and nuts: Diets high in omega-3 fatty acids may have health benefits, including: Trans fats are a type of fat that raises bad cholesterol and lowers good cholesterol. There are very small amounts of naturally occurring trans fat in meats and dairy from grazing animals, such as cows, sheep and goats. But most trans fats are in plant oils that have been chemically changed to be a solid fat. These are called partially hydrogenated oils. At one time, trans fat oils were thought to be a healthy choice to replace saturated fats. They also were inexpensive and a had a long shelf life. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined that artificially created trans fats are \"no longer recognized as safe\" in foods. They are no longer used in U.S. food production. They may still be used in other countries. A healthy diet is a balance between taking in enough calories and nutrients for your level of activity. Your health care provider or a dietician can help you understand goals for calories, nutrients and types of foods to eat. One thing to consider is that each gram of fat has 9 calories. That's true for all fats. So calories can add up quickly, even with healthy fats. For example, walnuts are a healthy snack high in polyunsaturated fats. But just a dozen walnut halves contain about 160 calories — more calories than in one large apple. The key message about fats is to focus on eating healthy fats and limiting unhealthy fats. Eat more fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds and whole grains that are rich in vitamins, nutrients and fiber.

That's roughly the speed of your home broadband network. Carriers are rolling out 4G over the next few years, and they're in different stages of their expansion. Verizon currently has 371 markets covered nationwide, covering 75% of the U.S population. AT&T has 65 markets, covering 24% of the population. Sprint covers just 19 markets. Those numbers are in constant flux: All of the carriers plan to significantly increase their 4G coverage fairly rapidly. AT&T says it will have 4G LTE in more than 100 cities by the end of 2012. Sprint says it will have its network available in 100 additional cities \"in the coming months.\" Verizon plans to have 400 markets covered by the end of the year. Some metro areas where LTE is partially deployed do not yet appear on carriers' official coverage maps. Eventually, all three nationwide iPhone carriers say their 4G coverage will be as pervasive as 3G. Until then, users will find their iPhones shifting in and out of 4G. When your phone leaves a 4G zone, it will seamlessly move to 3G as a backup. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

You will basically need to do some googling if you want to find this info since after each new iPhone release there are plenty of publications on cNet and other tech websites that would point which models are sold by which networks. I bet if you even simply google your model, you will get a result with the carrier who was selling that model. Jun 9, 2018 by Andy L @andy888 I didn't say it was. I simply said it was a comprehensive list of all iPhones and model numbers from Apple. Jun 9, 2018 by S W Actually if you have an iphone go to settings/general/about it gives you the network you are on and the model and serial number of your phone. Jul 6, 2018 by Matt McMillen Andy L @andy888 Rep: 25 2 Posted: May 29, 2018 Actually, in most cases, it is impossible to tell which carrier the iPhone is or was used on by simply looking at the model number. Though in some cases it might work. There is actually an IMEI check which can show what is known as the \"Initial Activation Policy\" and this would be the original carrier of the device. Notice however that the same device can be used on another carrier later. Was this answer helpful? 1 Comment: imei.info will tell you the carrier it was sold to. But in the US if the model has 2 available (GSM and GSM+CDMA), GSM only are sold to Tmobile/AT&T, and Verizon and Sprint get the other model. Jun 9, 2018 by S W Adams Bell @adamsb Rep: 1 2 Posted: Jun 8, 2018 To find what carrier network it's locked your iPhone, Verizon, T-Mobile or AT&T, you can do this using iPhone IMEI Checker service. You need to find your IMEI number from your Cell Phone, and go here iPhone IMEI Carrier Checker to find the full informations for your device.

Jul 29, 2018 by Adams Bell William @williampr Rep: 13 1 Posted: Sep 30, 2019 If like to find what carrier network it’s locked need to use some official IMEI checker from AT&T or Verizon company.

Past 24 Hours: 7 Past 7 Days: 27 Past 30 Days: 123 All Time: 54,674", "Discover Thomson Reuters By Reuters Staff 3 Min Read NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL.O closed down and AT&T Inc. T.N finished up slightly but Sprint gained about 4 percent on Monday amid mixed Wall Street iPhone sales estimates for the device's first weekend on the market. Some investors were disappointed with initial iPhone sales, while others saw early estimates as a boost to Sprint Nextel S.N, a smaller rival of AT&T, the exclusive U.S. service provider for Apple's first cell phone. “I think there was a bit of a relief rally ... Sprint’s not going to get destroyed on this,” at least in the second quarter, said JP Morgan analyst Thomas Lee, adding that some investors had been worried because the iPhone had launched on the second to last day of the June quarter. Sprint, which had promised improvements in customer growth for the second quarter, is seen as the most vulnerable to iPhone-related customer losses because it has a high proportion of customers who use data services included in the iPhone. Bill Shope, who covers Apple for JP Morgan, estimated Apple sold about 312,000 iPhones on Friday and Saturday, he said in a research note. “We believe initial demand may have been disappointing, but it’s still early,” Shope said “We don’t believe supply was much better than expected, so demand could be a bit light.” Other analysts were more positive. Gene Munster, analyst at Piper Jaffray, estimated sales for Friday and Saturday at 500,000, beating his original forecast of 200,000. “We were surprised by the rate at which Apple was able to sell the handsets, with 50 cashiers processing up to 1,000 iPhones/hour in some stores,” Munster wrote in a note. At UBS, analyst Ben Reitzes said: “Given strong initial demand, we continue to believe our unit estimates of 950,000 for 2007 and 8.1 million for 2008 could prove conservative.” The iPhone, which combines a music player, a Web browser and a phone costs $500 or $600, depending on storage capacity. About 2 percent of people who bought the iPhone have been experiencing delays in activating their service, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday. AT&T said on Monday that it had resolved most activation delay problems. Separately, Apple was hit by news that the biggest music company, Universal Music Group, has refused to sign a long-term deal with Apple’s iTunes Music Store. This could allow Universal to pull some of its artists’ music from iTunes to sign exclusive deals with other partners. ITunes sells music that can be played on both the iPod and the iPhone. Shares of Sprint closed up 87 cents, or 4 percent, at $21.58 on New York Stock Exchange. AT&T shares finished up 35 cents, or almost 1 percent, at $41.85 on the NYSE, while Apple shares closed down 78 cents at $121.26 on Nasdaq.

Today, Sprint drastically increased the appeal for a Sprint iPhone 5 by naming specific 4G LTE launch cities for the next few months and sharing plans to complete 4G LTE coverage to the scale of its current 3G network by the end of 2013. Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 5 with 4G LTE support at the September 12th event in California and the iPhone 5 release date is set for 9 days later on September 21st. Friday we received word by way of The Wall Street Journal that the iPhone 5 will support global 4G LTE. The Sprint 4G LTE network is only live in 19 markets today, but by the end of the year it is likely to show up in the following cities. View Sprint 3G LTE coverage Estimated 2012 in a full screen map The addition of over 100 new Sprint 4G LTE cities and markets increases the appeal of Sprint’s 4G LTE Unlimited plan, and is enough to put a Sprint iPhone 5 purchase back on the radar.

And all the other carriers have it here, even Tmobile. Oh how I wish they had the iPhone :( Bigtaggg 10/01/2012 at 11:02 am Obviously Sprint cannot compete in California when it comes to bandwidth.

Sprint's unlimited data plan may get pricier in the near future. Sprint may raise prices for unlimited data in the latter part of the year, CEO Marcelo Claure said in an interview with Kansas City, Mo.-based TV station KSHB. \"For the next few months, unlimited continues,\" he said. \"We might increase prices towards the latter part of the year.\" Sprint offers an unlimited plan for $85 a month, and a special $50 plan for iPhone users. More ominously for data hogs on Sprint's network: he warned that the company might eliminate unlimited data in the future. A spokesman declined to add anything beyond Claure's comments. The unlimited data plan -- \"Unlimited Everything\" -- was the marquee offering by former CEO Dan Hesse, who attempted to shake up the industry with an all-you-can-eat offering that simplified how much you paid each month. Even as Sprint struggled with poor network coverage, slow download speeds and customer defections, the offer was able to pique the interest of a certain segment of heavy data users. But with Sprint focused on improving its network coverage and the cost of carrying all of those streaming videos, music and photos mounting, the company is taking a closer look at unlimited data. That Sprint, which has long stood by its unlimited offer, is considering eliminating the option speaks to the mounting costs of maintaining and upgrading a wireless network. Sprint said on Thursday that it would stop throttling, or slowing down the connection, of its heaviest data users subscribed to an unlimited plan. The company made the move a day after the Federal Communications Commission fined AT&T $100 million because it throttled its grandfathered unlimited data subscribers, which the agency felt meant those plans were \"falsely labeled.\" Claure is focused more on network quality. At Recode's Code conference in Ranchos Palos Verde, Calif, he boasted that Sprint would have the No. 1 or No. 2 network in the nation, suggesting his coverage would potentially surpass AT&T and Verizon Wireless. He also warned that unlimited data plans couldn't last forever, although he said it still made financial sense. Sprint's unlimited plan was popular at a time when AT&T and Verizon Wireless moved away from unlimited data, instead convincing its customers to sign up for tiered plans with a set amount of data for individuals or families. If you went over that limit, you would have to pay an overage fee. Sprint came in and offered ease of mind with the wireless bill. But Sprint isn't alone in unlimited anymore. T-Mobile also offers an unlimited data plan for $80 a month. Phones Foldable Phones Headphones Mobile Accessories Smartwatches Wireless Plans", "The Trump-era DOJ’s decision to allow the T-Mobile/Sprint merger will go down as one of the worst merger-enforcement mistakes in decades. This merger will be responsible for transferring billions of dollars in wealth from average Americans to the T-Mobile/Sprint shareholders. To guard against repeating the mistake of T-Mobile/Sprint, we need a strengthened structural presumption, one that statutorily instructs flipping the burden of persuasion to defendants and requires “clear and convincing evidence” to be rebutted. When the Trump-era DOJ allowed T-Mobile and Sprint to merge in July 2019, it promised the best of both worlds: consumers would benefit from T-Mobile’s accelerated 5G deployment and retain a fourth wireless provider. To effect the latter, then-AAG Makan Delrahim devised a divestiture that would reposition satellite-TV provider DISH as Sprint’s replacement. Here was his plan: Sprint would sell its prepaid-wireless assets to DISH. These assets included Sprint’s 9.3 million prepaid subscribers, its Boost brand, its 800 MHz spectrum licenses, and the Sprint stores and cell towers that the new T-Mobile did not want. DISH would then use these cell sites and its pre-existing spectrum, augmented from the divestiture, to build its own wireless network using never-before-deployed technology. While DISH worked on its complex nationwide build, it could serve its customers by paying for them to roam on the new T-Mobile’s infrastructure for seven years. Not even two years later, Delrahim’s plan is already falling apart. The prepaid customers DISH inherited from Sprint disproportionately buy cheap wireless service, which runs on the old CDMA standard used in 3G networks. In the latest turn of events, T-Mobile announced last month that it would discontinue its CDMA service in January 2022, nearly two years ahead of schedule. With T-Mobile’s shutdown, DISH’s customers will have to “get new devices, new SIMs, or upgrade via software.” DISH now has to take on an unexpected upgrade that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. T-Mobile’s announcement led DISH CEO Charlie Ergen to denounce the unexpected shutdown as “anticompetitive.” DISH has already warned investors that with the shutdown, its trend of bleeding hundreds of thousands of subscribers may soon turn into a hemorrhage. For T-Mobile, this is great news, since many of the subscribers ditching DISH are bound to turn to T-Mobile’s own cheap wireless plan. But for price-sensitive consumers, the forecast is grim: while they could choose between T-Mobile and Sprint before the merger, these dissatisfied customers now effectively face a monopoly provider. It should come as no surprise that DISH is struggling in the wireless market, and price-conscious consumers are bearing the brunt of harm from the merger’s fallout. We knew back in 2011 that T-Mobile and Sprint competed particularly closely in low-cost wireless services. We also knew from DOJ’s longstanding Merger Remedies Policy that remedies should not require an entrant like DISH to depend on an incumbent who is a direct rival; it makes perfect sense that T-Mobile would rebel against helping DISH grow into a firm that can compete against T-Mobile itself. Not only was the DISH divestiture ill-devised, but the T-Mobile/Sprint merger never did pass muster under basic logic. If it was really critical to keep four players in the wireless market—so important that DISH needed to enter—why even let T-Mobile buy Sprint in the first place? Why not just keep the existing fourth player, instead of designing a Rube Goldberg settlement in the hopes that a new player will grow to have the competitive force of Sprint in seven years’ time? These frustrations have fueled heated criticism of the merger. Such critiques are well-placed, as the merger has already produced harm and threatens to wreak more damage. Besides hobbling DISH, T-Mobile will degrade the quality of its service this April by automatically enrolling its subscribers into an aggressive, personalized ad-targeting program. T-Mobile has also signaled to investors that it has become more like its rivals Verizon and AT&T. On an investor call in February, CEO Mike Sievert said, “We’ve competed mostly on price in the past, if we’re honest. Now, we have a premium product.” Translation: the era of aggressive price competition in wireless is over. Looking forward, we can expect T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon to nestle into a cozy triopoly that returns immense profits to their shareholders. T-Mobile is already prepared to deliver on this prospect. On March 11, it predicted to investors that its free cash flow will be flush enough to support a $60 billion stock buyback within five years. Stock buybacks benefit the investor class, whose members are disproportionately the wealthiest people in America; recent surveys show that the top 10 percent of households own approximately 80 percent of all stocks. In contrast, nearly all households across the income distribution buy wireless services, and low-income households particularly favor prepaid plans, a segment where T-Mobile and Sprint had competed vigorously pre-merger. With its latest proclamations to investors, T-Mobile celebrates the fact that its merger will transfer billions of wealth from average Americans to the rich, further widening the chasm between the haves and have-nots. For this reason and many others, the T-Mobile/Sprint deal will go down as one of the worst merger-enforcement decisions in decades. “the T-Mobile/Sprint deal will go down as one of the worst merger-enforcement decisions in decades.” In this postmortem, we examine how the deal came to close, and what we might learn from the mistakes made along the way. DOJ should never have approved the deal in the first place. The T-Mobile/Sprint merger presented a harmful 4-to-3 combination in the critical and well-defined market of mobile wireless services. Four-to-three mergers deservedly raise eyebrows, and evidence from other countries showed that 4-3 mergers in the wireless market would increase prices. Further, the post-merger market shares blasted through the HHI thresholds in the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, making the transaction presumptively anticompetitive. As such, a settlement should never have been on the table. But after many years of trying to merge, the parties finally found a receptive agency head in Delrahim, the “veteran lobbyist” tapped to be head of the Trump Administration’s Antitrust Division. When presented with the deal, Delrahim was eager to refashion the telecom market and less eager to deliver on his charge of protecting consumer welfare. Delrahim took a series of unorthodox steps. He became a mediator between the parties, helping hold the deal together when tensions between the CEOs ran high. He exchanged text messages with Ergen and advised him on how to secure regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission, which also needed to approve the deal. And when the parties closed their transaction in July 2020, Delrahim issued a press release to “congratulate” T-Mobile and Sprint for merging. Not only did his conduct conflict with his role as the nation’s head antitrust enforcer, but the behavioral remedy Delrahim reached in T-Mobile/Sprint contradicted his 2017 statements. Then, with an eye toward signaling his unwillingness to settle in AT&T/Time Warner, he inveighed against behavioral remedies. “[A]t times antitrust enforcers have experimented with allowing illegal mergers to proceed subject to certain behavioral commitments. That approach is fundamentally regulatory, imposing ongoing government oversight on what should preferably be a free market.” He added, “[I]f a merger is illegal, we should only accept a clean and complete solution.” Perhaps Delrahim was conscious of his hypocrisy when he later announced the settlement he had reached in the T-Mobile/Sprint merger, as he was careful to cast it as “structural” and not “behavioral.” But because the crux of the settlement is to have DISH roam on T-Mobile’s network for seven years, the settlement is behavioral at its core. Studying the divestiture against the Trump-era DOJ’s handling of other antitrust cases sheds additional light. Compare Delrahim’s adamant refusal to accept behavioral conditions when the parties proposed them in AT&T/Time Warner—which presented a weaker merits case—with his enthusiasm to strike behavioral conditions in the T-Mobile/Sprint divestiture to DISH—even though this 4-3 merger was presumptively illegal and raised nearly every red flag in the Horizontal Merger Guidelines. Taken together, these two decisions cannot be reconciled on principle. Because the Delrahim-led DOJ was derelict in policing the T-Mobile/Sprint deal, a group of states challenged the merger in federal court. In presenting their case, they pointed out flaws in the DISH settlement—chiefly that the divestiture relied on T-Mobile to help DISH grow to scale in wireless, but T-Mobile would have the ability and incentive to cripple DISH. At trial in the Southern District of New York, Ergen testified that he was confident DISH would receive adequate service from T-Mobile through the roaming agreement, even though new T-Mobile and DISH would compete for wireless subscribers. He offered that DISH had never had a problem with buying services from AT&T, despite AT&T’s DirecTV competing head-to-head with DISH’s satellite-television offering. Ergen, however, conveniently omitted the fact that AT&T, after merging with Time Warner, had blacked out HBO and Cinemax for DISH’s satellite and Sling TV subscribers. The loss of AT&T’s content contributed to DISH’s loss of more than 330,000 subscribers that quarter. Despite this recent experience, Ergen maintained in court that there would be no problem with DISH relying on a direct competitor for a critical input in the mobile-wireless industry it was preparing to enter. Judge Victor Marrero did pick up on this danger during his questioning at trial, but he ultimately believed the DOJ-appointed monitor and wholesale-price formula would be enough to rein in T-Mobile’s incentives. We have now seen that those checks were inadequate. This is no surprise, as economic theory predicts that companies’ profit incentives are strong enough to overcome inevitably incomplete contractual restraints. More generally, Judge Marrero underestimated the strength of the parties’ incentives in his assessment of the merger. Instead of accounting for how the merger would facilitate collusion by creating three symmetrical players, for instance, he decided it would be easier to assess witness credibility. Judge Marrero purported to study the executives’ behavior and glean “telltale” patterns of truthfulness, concluding that the new T-Mobile would continue to compete vigorously against AT&T and Verizon. In so doing, he placed his faith in the self-serving testimony of executives rather than in decades of enforcement experience, economic evidence, and jurisprudence. “the episode of the T-Mobile/Sprint merger underscores the need for multiple enforcers to police the antitrust beat. Left to its own devices, DOJ waved the merger through. If not for the state attorneys general, the story would have ended there, without any governmental challenge.” Any student of corporations knows that firms operate to maximize their profits, and shareholders will replace managers who routinely turn down legal opportunities to earn profit. The managers of T-Mobile and Sprint are no different. Even though they promised the court they would compete vigorously and keep prices low, they will—and in fact, they must—fulfill their profit-maximizing mandate. So when “pulling their punches” in a comfortable oligopoly is more profitable than competing vigorously, we should expect companies to do so—even if particular executives have promised otherwise. Even more troubling than ignoring firms’ profit motivations is the idea that the fate of a merger that posed $8.7 billion in annual consumer harm would be based on perceptions of individual executives’ demeanor. The entity to analyze in a merger is “the firm,” not any one individual. Not only does the individual manager have a financial interest in the merger being consummated, but the manager is not the dispositive player, as they may change roles or move on from the company. And regardless of what that manager says in court, he (in this merger, they were all “he’s”) has a fiduciary duty to shareholders and the same set of incentives and assets as anyone else in that role. Therefore, the company’s incentives are the correct focus for a court. We need clear-eyed decision makers to decide antitrust cases. Judges need to understand firms’ incentives and should be willing to wade into the evidence, engage with economics, and respect the many decades of learning embedded in the structural presumption. In T-Mobile/Sprint, Judge Marrero dismissed the structural presumption, finding it was overcome by the arrival of 5G, DISH’s pseudo-entry as a tenant on T-Mobile’s network, and executives’ self-interested representations. The structural presumption is strongly supported by theory and experience. To accord it the weight commensurate with its robust support, the structural presumption should be enshrined into the law itself and rebutted only upon “clear and convincing evidence.” When setting up the structural presumption, Philadelphia National Bank had required defendants to produce evidence “clearly showing that the merger is not likely to have such anticompetitive effects.” In the decades since, however, courts have watered down the standard to allow defendants to rebut the presumption upon only a “showing.” The judiciary has worried about imposing a “heavy burden of production” on defendants when “it is easy” for the government “to establish a prima facie case.” But the very point of the structural presumption should be to require defendants to demonstrate convincingly why their merger would not harm competition in cases where the government can easily show that market shares are high. To overcome decades of judicial erosion, we need new legislation to shore up the structural presumption. Specifically, a statutory structural presumption should go beyond the existing Baker Hughes formulation—it should fully flip the burden of persuasion to defendants when the presumption is triggered and require “clear and convincing” evidence to be rebutted. Senator Klobuchar’s recently proposed bill marks a step in the right direction, as it would hardwire the existing structural presumption into statute and expand it to include acquisitions of nascent competitors and mega-mergers valued at more than $5 billion. Further, the episode of the T-Mobile/Sprint merger underscores the need for multiple enforcers to police the antitrust beat. Left to its own devices, DOJ waved the merger through. If not for the state attorneys general, the story would have ended there, without any governmental challenge. In T-Mobile/Sprint, however, the states took on the unprecedented task of challenging the merger themselves, demonstrating the valuable function of the states to undergird antitrust enforcement efforts when a federal agency has abdicated that duty. Fiona Scott Morton served as an economic expert and testified at trial for the states in their challenge of the T-Mobile/Sprint merger. Melody Wang worked on the T-Mobile/Sprint merger while at the New York Attorney General’s office. She also assisted with The Capitol Forum’s coverage of T-Mobile/Sprint, both when the deal was announced in 2018 and during the 2019 trial. No related posts. No related posts.

Contact Us | Privacy Policy The three major US carriers all offer \"unlimited\" 5G plans for the many iPhone 12 owners set to enjoy faster speeds. AppleInsider cuts through the noise to compare plans and help you find the best wireless network for your new iPhone. Keep in mind that \"unlimited\" has caveats. Every carrier plan includes the possibility of throttling your data to slower speeds after you reach a certain level of usage. Additionally, some plans have limits like lower-quality video streaming or slower hotspots after hitting a separate tethering cap. Each plan also discounts its per-line pricing when you add additional numbers to your plan. The three carriers each have subscription-based extras to lure you towards their service and entice you into opting for a pricier tier. For example, T-Mobile bundles Netflix with some family plans, AT&T uses HBO to lure you in, and Verizon adds Disney services and Apple Music to its most expensive package. Let's take a look at each network's options and the extras that go along with them to help you pick the best plan for your new iPhone 12. AT&T for iPhone 12 AT&T offers 5G in both standard (sub-6GHz) and mmWave, which it calls \"5G+\", in select cities. The network gives you the choice of three \"Unlimited\" plans that all include 5G access. The highest-tier plan, at $85/month for one line, is called Unlimited Elite. It offers 100GB of data before possibly throttling down to much slower 2G speeds. That is the highest total of any of the carriers' plans, so this may be the best choice if you stream loads of content on the go. AT&T takes advantage of its purchase of Warner Media, including an HBO Max subscription in this highest-tier bundle. Unlimited Elite is also AT&T's only plan with HD streaming. The other two plans are limited to standard-definition (SD) video streams. AT&TThrottle AfterHotspot DataVideo1 Line5+ LinesUnlimited Elite100GB30GBHD$85$45 eachUnlimited Extra50GB15GBSD$75$35 eachUnlimited StarterAnytimeN/ASD$65$30 each Unlimited Extra is AT&T's middle tier, offering 50GB of data before possible throttling. At $10 cheaper than Unlimited Elite, this middle-ground plan makes other concessions like a lower hotspot cap (15GB vs. 30GB), SD video, and no HBO. Unlimited Starter is AT&T's cheapest 5G plan, and it has significant caveats. The carrier reserves the right to throttle your data to 2G speeds at any time based on network congestion. While this may not cause concern in more rural areas, that plan isn't wise for anyone living in or near cities. Unlimited Starter also doesn't offer any hotspot data or the Advanced Mobile Security, which includes spam and fraud call blocking, safe browsing, and identity monitoring that the other two plans include. It's a little cheaper at $65/month for one line but is too great a compromise for urbanites who need reliably fast data speeds. Verizon for iPhone 12 Verizon has four pricing tiers for its \"Unlimited\" 5G plans. It's the most expensive of the three carriers, though not by a wide margin. Verizon calls its premium tier Get More Unlimited, costing $90/month for one line. The plan supports both sub-6GHz 5G (\"5G Nationwide\") and mmWave 5G (\"5G UltraWideband\") where supported. On this plan, Verizon may throttle your data to 3G speeds after 50GB of high-speed usage. The carrier includes 30GB of 5G or LTE hotspot tethering in its most expensive plan. It adds a Disney Bundle, including subscriptions to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. Verizon also throws in an Apple Music subscription and 600GB of Verizon Cloud, its phone-backup service. However, iPhone owners may find it easier to stick with Apple's integrated iCloud backups.

Do More Unlimited and Play More Unlimited each offer 50GB of data use before possible tethering. Do More Unlimited prioritizes Verizon Cloud (600GB), and 50% off tablets, hotspot devices, and smartwatches. Meanwhile, Play More Unlimited replaces those perks with a Disney bundle subscription. Verizon's entry-level plan, Start Unlimited, rings up at $70 for one line. Like the other entry-level plans, it may revert to throttled speeds at any time, so avoid this option if you want reliable data speeds. It also doesn't include mmWave 5G, though Verizon will add that for an extra $10/month. Start Unlimited doesn't include any hotspot data, and its subscription add-ons (Apple Music and Disney+) are only six-month trials. T-Mobile for iPhone 12 After completing its Sprint purchase this year, T-Mobile is the last of the three major US carriers. The company offers three pricing tiers for 5G service: Magenta Plus, Magenta, and Essentials. Unlike the other carriers, T-Mobile includes taxes and fees in its prices and may end up being a better deal than would appear at first glance. Magenta Plus costs $85 for one line and will possibly throttle data after 50GB of use. In this plan, T-Mobile includes HD video streaming, 20GB of hotspot data (reverting to 3G after that), a Netflix subscription (standard, two HD screens) for family plans, 5GB of LTE in Canada and Mexico, and Gogo in-flight texting and Wi-Fi. T-MobileThrottle AfterHotspot DataVideo1 Line5+ LinesMagenta Plus50GB20GBHD$85$40 eachMagenta50GB3GBSD$70$32 eachEssentialsanytimeN/ASD$60$27 each The Magenta tier offers $70 for one line and has the same 50GB cap before throttling. It only offers SD video streaming, drops the hotspot cap to 3GB before throttling, and offers a lower-tier Netflix subscription (basic, one SD screen). The Essentials plan costs $60 for one line and doesn't include any 5G or LTE hotspot data. Like AT&T's and Verizon's, T-Mobile's cheapest plan also may throttle data any time networks become congested, making it another poor choice for city dwellers. Which do you choose? None of this makes any difference if you can't get a 5G signal. Signal reception is the most critical factor in your decision, so be sure to check each carrier's coverage maps, including 5G rollouts, before making a decision. If you're able, asking friends in your area what their real-world coverage is like or borrowing their devices to do speed tests would give you an even better perspective. Verizon has the best rural sub-mmWave coverage, so if you're far from a city, that alone may settle your decision. Carriers prioritize urban and suburban areas for 5G towers, and, regardless of carrier, the fastest speeds will reach less-populated areas much more slowly. While indoors, you will almost never see the faster speeds that mmWave can deliver. But, the 5G network can have some routing improvements leading to faster real-world speeds, in good conditions. Faster 5G speeds will mean eating through data more quickly. While 50GB is more than enough for most people, you may consider the 100GB in AT&T's most-expensive plan if you worry about passing that. As we saw in our individual-carrier breakdowns, none of the plans offer truly unlimited high-speed data. Here's a look at the data caps before each plan is subject to throttled speeds. Blank lines mean they can lower your speeds at any time. If you plan on using your iPhone 12 as a personal hotspot for other devices, those limits may weigh into your decision as well. Verizon and AT&T offer more hotspot data with their premium plans, though T-Mobile provides an extra 10GB for an additional $10/month. None of the providers include hotspot data on their cheapest tiers. The media-subscription add-ons for each plan are also worth considering. For example, if you're a Verizon customer who already subscribes to Disney+ and Hulu, bundling them with your phone plan may end up being worth it. However, if you're considering these options, take a moment to add up what those subscriptions would cost separately and weigh that against a pricier phone bill. Carriers will discount extra lines on your plan, with the cost of each dropping more with each additional line. Families will save money if they have all of their lines on the same carrier through a single account. 5G is a moving target, as carriers only started rolling out their next-gen networks within the last two years. All three providers regularly add more areas to their 5G maps, and their coverage may look quite different when we revisit this comparison for the iPhone 13. Keep in mind that \"unlimited\" has caveats. Every carrier plan includes the possibility of throttling your data to slower speeds after you reach a certain level of usage. Additionally, some plans have limits like lower-quality video streaming or slower hotspots after hitting a separate tethering cap.

AT&T offers 5G in both standard (sub-6GHz) and mmWave, which it calls \"5G+\", in select cities. The network gives you the choice of three \"Unlimited\" plans that all include 5G access. The highest-tier plan, at $85/month for one line, is called Unlimited Elite. It offers 100GB of data before possibly throttling down to much slower 2G speeds. That is the highest total of any of the carriers' plans, so this may be the best choice if you stream loads of content on the go. AT&T takes advantage of its purchase of Warner Media, including an HBO Max subscription in this highest-tier bundle. Unlimited Elite is also AT&T's only plan with HD streaming. The other two plans are limited to standard-definition (SD) video streams. Unlimited Extra is AT&T's middle tier, offering 50GB of data before possible throttling. At $10 cheaper than Unlimited Elite, this middle-ground plan makes other concessions like a lower hotspot cap (15GB vs. 30GB), SD video, and no HBO. Unlimited Starter is AT&T's cheapest 5G plan, and it has significant caveats. The carrier reserves the right to throttle your data to 2G speeds at any time based on network congestion. While this may not cause concern in more rural areas, that plan isn't wise for anyone living in or near cities. Unlimited Starter also doesn't offer any hotspot data or the Advanced Mobile Security, which includes spam and fraud call blocking, safe browsing, and identity monitoring that the other two plans include. It's a little cheaper at $65/month for one line but is too great a compromise for urbanites who need reliably fast data speeds. Verizon has four pricing tiers for its \"Unlimited\" 5G plans. It's the most expensive of the three carriers, though not by a wide margin. Verizon calls its premium tier Get More Unlimited, costing $90/month for one line. The plan supports both sub-6GHz 5G (\"5G Nationwide\") and mmWave 5G (\"5G UltraWideband\") where supported. On this plan, Verizon may throttle your data to 3G speeds after 50GB of high-speed usage. The carrier includes 30GB of 5G or LTE hotspot tethering in its most expensive plan. It adds a Disney Bundle, including subscriptions to Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. Verizon also throws in an Apple Music subscription and 600GB of Verizon Cloud, its phone-backup service. However, iPhone owners may find it easier to stick with Apple's integrated iCloud backups. Verizon's next two tiers cost the same ($80 for one line) but accentuate different perks. Do More Unlimited and Play More Unlimited each offer 50GB of data use before possible tethering. Do More Unlimited prioritizes Verizon Cloud (600GB), and 50% off tablets, hotspot devices, and smartwatches. Meanwhile, Play More Unlimited replaces those perks with a Disney bundle subscription. Verizon's entry-level plan, Start Unlimited, rings up at $70 for one line. Like the other entry-level plans, it may revert to throttled speeds at any time, so avoid this option if you want reliable data speeds. It also doesn't include mmWave 5G, though Verizon will add that for an extra $10/month. Start Unlimited doesn't include any hotspot data, and its subscription add-ons (Apple Music and Disney+) are only six-month trials. After completing its Sprint purchase this year, T-Mobile is the last of the three major US carriers. The company offers three pricing tiers for 5G service: Magenta Plus, Magenta, and Essentials. Unlike the other carriers, T-Mobile includes taxes and fees in its prices and may end up being a better deal than would appear at first glance. Magenta Plus costs $85 for one line and will possibly throttle data after 50GB of use. In this plan, T-Mobile includes HD video streaming, 20GB of hotspot data (reverting to 3G after that), a Netflix subscription (standard, two HD screens) for family plans, 5GB of LTE in Canada and Mexico, and Gogo in-flight texting and Wi-Fi. The Magenta tier offers $70 for one line and has the same 50GB cap before throttling. It only offers SD video streaming, drops the hotspot cap to 3GB before throttling, and offers a lower-tier Netflix subscription (basic, one SD screen). The Essentials plan costs $60 for one line and doesn't include any 5G or LTE hotspot data. Like AT&T's and Verizon's, T-Mobile's cheapest plan also may throttle data any time networks become congested, making it another poor choice for city dwellers. None of this makes any difference if you can't get a 5G signal. Signal reception is the most critical factor in your decision, so be sure to check each carrier's coverage maps, including 5G rollouts, before making a decision. If you're able, asking friends in your area what their real-world coverage is like or borrowing their devices to do speed tests would give you an even better perspective. Verizon has the best rural sub-mmWave coverage, so if you're far from a city, that alone may settle your decision. Carriers prioritize urban and suburban areas for 5G towers, and, regardless of carrier, the fastest speeds will reach less-populated areas much more slowly. While indoors, you will almost never see the faster speeds that mmWave can deliver. But, the 5G network can have some routing improvements leading to faster real-world speeds, in good conditions. Faster 5G speeds will mean eating through data more quickly. While 50GB is more than enough for most people, you may consider the 100GB in AT&T's most-expensive plan if you worry about passing that. As we saw in our individual-carrier breakdowns, none of the plans offer truly unlimited high-speed data. Here's a look at the data caps before each plan is subject to throttled speeds. Blank lines mean they can lower your speeds at any time. If you plan on using your iPhone 12 as a personal hotspot for other devices, those limits may weigh into your decision as well. Verizon and AT&T offer more hotspot data with their premium plans, though T-Mobile provides an extra 10GB for an additional $10/month. None of the providers include hotspot data on their cheapest tiers. The media-subscription add-ons for each plan are also worth considering. For example, if you're a Verizon customer who already subscribes to Disney+ and Hulu, bundling them with your phone plan may end up being worth it. However, if you're considering these options, take a moment to add up what those subscriptions would cost separately and weigh that against a pricier phone bill. Carriers will discount extra lines on your plan, with the cost of each dropping more with each additional line. Families will save money if they have all of their lines on the same carrier through a single account. 5G is a moving target, as carriers only started rolling out their next-gen networks within the last two years. All three providers regularly add more areas to their 5G maps, and their coverage may look quite different when we revisit this comparison for the iPhone 13. I prepay mint $300 then never think about it again for another year. Cant justify another $900 for mobile service and a $1000 for a 5g phone on top of the $800 i pay per year for Wifi for my Mac, iPad and work PC. No thanks. It all adds up very very quickly.

Yep!It all comes down to cost benefit. Or it should.My first career was a cost accountant and cost analyst and a big part of the job was doing cost analysis of new products and equipment -- was it worth it?My second career was a systems analyst (mostly in the financial area) and while cost vs benefit was never a biggee, make vs buy always was.My third career was a psych nurse working with mentally ill people living in the community and the benefit for those patients taking the drugs (i.e., some level of sanity) was constantly being compared to the 'cost' of the nasty side effects they generated.But, when it comes to electronics people tend to just jump for the latest and greatest.For myself, I refuse to pay a grand or two for a PC. The one I'm typing on now cost $200 (used) and works as well and in some ways better than those costing 5 or 10 times more.Likewise, my car is now 21 years old. But it not only runs perfectly but no reasonably priced new car will provide me with anything that my old one doesn't already do. True, its not as shiny and doesn't have a modern look. But, functionally a new one simply wouldn't provide me with anything more than it already does..... So, I'll save that money for other things and for when I really need it. Whew, I had no idea the monthly costs had gone up so much. These prices are nutso. I knew VZW and ATT were stupid expensive (which is why I left ATT years ago, among many reasons), but TMob used to be really cheap—I have an older plan on TMob with all the same specs/limits as Magenta Plus (but no Netflix subscription—whooptido), two lines, $72 a month. All included. I already confirmed with their (very nice) customer service that I can keep that plan even if I upgrade to a 5G phone. I feel for people who only need one line on any of these plans, they're getting screwed. Whew, I had no idea the monthly costs had gone up so much. These prices are nutso.

Interesting that my T-Mobil plan for old farts (55 & over) does not include 5G. To get 5G I'd have to switch to a standard plan at a substantial increase: 2 lines on my old farts plan costs $55 a month but the regular \"essential\" plan that includes 5G would cost $90 - almost 2/3's more!But, to be fair, the 55 plan was always cheaper so not all of that could be tied directly to 5G. But for me, it would still be a substantial increase. GeorgeBMac said: goodbyeranch said: I prepay mint $300 then never think about it again for another year.

I would think T-mobile would allow 5G on the 55 and over plan since they rolled it out first on the sub frequency that should improve coverage in rural areas. If not for the speed, at least make sure the 55+ plus plan has good service coverage with 5G for these people to have service and make calls when needed. After all they agreed to increase rural area coverage as part fo the sprint merger. I guess I will find out if the coverage with sub 5G is better sometime today since I am in that rural area.

There are stark differences between the two: Verizon regularly places as #1 for network coverage and speed in 3rd-party tests like those run by OpenSignal and RootMetrics, often placing them in first place for the Big 4. In contrast, Sprint places dead last of the 4 in both areas -- so, they compete with Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile by pricing their wireless plans much cheaper and including some great perks. But how do Sprint and Verizon stackup directly against each other? You may think it’s an easy win, but don’t be so sure. To find out, we checked out both carriers in categories such as price, plans, data, coverage, customer service, and device availability. Read on to learn what we found. It’s a pretty clear win for Sprint when it comes to price per month — even their top plan (Unlimited Premium) is $5 cheaper than Verizon’s bottom-tier unlimited plan (Go Unlimited). And as top-tier plans go, Sprint’s Premium is far and away cheaper than Verizon’s Above by $25 bucks a month. Go buy yourself a PS4 with the $300 bucks Sprint just saved you this year. Additional fees are the same when it comes to both carriers — activation fees come out to about $30, regardless of which carrier you choose. But those are one-time things, and Sprint even waives it if you buy your phone and plan online. Not Verizon, though, so that’s another win for Sprint. Both carriers offer multiple discounts. First up is the common one -- the autopay discount. You’ll save $5 bucks a line for both carriers. Verizon has a restriction, though: no credit cards. It’s debit only. The other discounts are pretty widespread between the two, but both offer discounts for certain employers, new subscribers, and military veterans and members. Sprint even has a plan designed specifically for military members that matches up pretty close to their Unlimited Plus plan: Verizon’s military discounts give you a broader range of options that can be applied to each of their plans: Whether Verizon or Sprint’s military discounts will be a good deal depends on you: what plans you’re looking at, your location, etc. Both take care of the men and women in uniform pretty well. Verizon also provides the same military discounts to first responders — Police, Fire, and EMS. Sprint does not. Sprint and Verizon both offer -- and focus on marketing -- their unlimited plans options. Both have 4 options (6 for Sprint if you count the Senior and Military options), but Sprint’s data deprioritization thresholds start out higher than Verizon -- 50GB of 4G LTE data starting at the Basic level. Verizon, in contrast, only offers 22GB of 4G LTE before they start throttling — except at the Above Unlimited level, which gives you 75GB. But even at that level, Sprint’s top-tier plan option gives you 100GB before slowing you down each month, $5-$15 cheaper, depending on discounts. That said, Verizon’s plans are pretty well-packed with features, like their middle-tier option, Beyond Unlimited — it has a 15GB hotspot allowance in addition to the 22GB data threshold. Plus, HD video streaming and some international perks, like TravelPass. But even then, Verizon has a hard time beating Sprint. Sprint offers HD video streaming and a 15GB hotspot on their middle-tier plan as well — Unlimited Plus also includes Hulu on demand and a Tidal music subscription, free of cost. And again, their cheaper. The win has to go to Sprint here. When it comes to limited-data options, Verizon offers more than Sprint. Sprint has just one: a 2GB plan. Verizon, however, gives you 3 to choose from: Small, Medium, or Large. *All plans reflect current promotional discounts Both carriers offer a lot of multiline options — pretty much any plan is fair game, whether it’s an unlimited, prepaid, or limited-data option. It’s worth noting that again, when it comes to price, Sprint wins out — especially with their current discounts. But you’ll pay for that when it comes to coverage, as you’ll soon find. Essentially, with Sprint you’ll get cheaper family plans with plenty of perks (Hulu, Tidal, etc.), but poorer coverage. And with Verizon, you’ll get great features, an awesome network, and still-solid discounts for every line you add -- but it still adds up to be pricier than Sprint. Verizon, top; Sprint, bottom. Finally — we reach a very important point: coverage and performance. We’ll spoil the comparison right away: Verizon wins, no-contest. Verizon Wireless simply has better coverage and speeds than Sprint and anyone else (although T-Mobile is hard on their tail for speed). According to OpenSignal and RootMetrics, Verizon handily won in nearly every category: 1st place for coverage, and 1st or 2nd for speed. Sprint, however, did not place at all in any category, coming in deadlast. Their commercials claim less than 1% difference in speed, and their coverage map actually looks pretty good — but no. They’ve never come in 1st or 2nd place for speed or coverage, and studies consistently place them in 3rd or 4th place. But if you live in a city, metro, or surrounding area, you’ll probably be okay. That said, though, T-Mobile and Sprint have been attempting to join forces in a merger to improve both of their offerings. That’s been slow-moving, however -- so we’ll see. Verizon wins again here. J.D. Power ranked Verizon as the 2nd-place winner for customer service, with 4 out of 5 power circles — only T-Mobile customers were more satisfied. Sprint came in last place, with just 2 power circles. In fact, Verizon was ranked about 11 points above the industry average (Verizon: 822 points; average: 811), while Sprint was ranked well below the average (755 points). Sprint has some work to do. Hopefully that merger with customer-service leader T-Mobile will improve them here. Not a comprehensive list. See here for additional smartphone offerings from Verizon and here for Sprint. It doesn’t matter much if you want the latest iPhone or Samsung Galaxy — both Verizon and Sprint will have it. And, while Verizon used to have a monopoly on Google Pixels, the Google phones have recently arrived at Sprint and other carriers, knocking off the Big Red’s advantage here. Really the only difference is if you want a Google Pixel 2, instead of 3 — you’ll have to bring your own with Sprint, while Verizon still carries the older model Google phone in-store. Just when you thought they were down for the count, Sprint gets back up. Verizon can’t beat Sprint’s perks. All of Sprint’s unlimited plans come with a free Hulu Limited Commercials streaming subscription. Plus you get international data (2G speeds) and texting in more than 100 countries. At the Plus level you get Tidal music added on, and at Premium you get Tidal, Lookout, and Amazon Prime in addition to Hulu. Verizon, however, doesn’t give you much for perks: you can get a good deal if you bundle with Verizon Fios internet, but that’s about it — and unlike Verizon’s wireless network, Fios is pretty restricted to the east coast. If you live somewhere Verizon Fios is available, check out their Double Play or Triple Play if you’re thinking about signing up for Verizon Wireless service -- you’ll get $10 off your phone bill + $10 off your Fios bill. When it comes to overall performance and speed, Verizon is better than Sprint — and any other carriers, for that matter. You can go just about anywhere in the U.S. and be confident that your phone will have good service (within reason). Plus, Verizon has great customer service. Sprint can’t say the same about either. That said, where Sprint can beat Verizon is with lower prices and great perks included in many plans. Plans are cheaper, free international texting and data (versus needing to buy a TravelPass at $10 a day with Verizon) is included, and you get great video, music, security, and even Amazon Prime subscriptions thrown in at no charge. So if you live in an area with good Sprint coverage, it may be a better bet and you might not notice a difference in performance. Luke is the managing editor and site manager of Dailywireless.

The 21st-century answer to the legendary Johnny Carson, Harris has been on a remarkable hot streak, turning award shows into a veritable showcase of entertainment magic. His charismatic presence, combined with a perfect blend of humor and professionalism, has captured the hearts of audiences and critics alike, reinvigorating the spirit of classic television ceremonies.\n\nBorn on June 15, 1973, in New York City, Harris burst onto the scene with his portrayal of the lovable straight man, Doogie Howser, M.D. on the long-running medical drama series. However, it was his transition to the stage that truly set the stage for his ultimate rise to the emcee throne. His Broadway debut in \"Rent\" and later in \"Cabaret\" showcased his incredible talent as a performer, which would soon translate into the realm of award show hosting.\n\nHarris made his mark on the annual Tony Awards in 2008, a role that critics described as a \"genius turn\" for the young actor. His witty banter, impeccable timing, and ability to connect with the audience made him a force to be reckoned with. His hosting style, characterized by a mix of humor, self-deprecation, and genuine enthusiasm, struck a chord with viewers who longed for a familiar face amidst the glitz and glamour of Hollywood award shows.\n\nBut it was his role at the 2015 Academy Awards, in the wake of a perceived dull and lackluster ceremony, that truly cemented Harris's place in the annals of awards-show history. He injected an unparalleled energy and excitement, turning even the most predictable moments into something thrillingly unpredictable. His opening monologue was a masterclass in modern comedy, and his interaction with the audience and presenters set a new standard for engaging television moments.\n\nHarris's ability to seamlessly transition between light-hearted jokes and heartfelt tributes has solidified his status as the modern-day awards-show maestro. The 2019 Met Gala, 2020 Emmy Awards, and the upcoming 2023 Academy Awards, all hosted by Harris, are further testament to his extraordinary hosting abilities. He has not only revived the art of the award show but also created a space where artists and celebrities alike feel comfortable, entertained, and celebrated.\n\nWhat separates Harris from his predecessors is his versatility – he is not just a polished host but a true performer, with a knack for bringing out the best in his guests. His innate ability to create a warm and inclusive environment has become a trademark, turning what were once staid affairs into unforgettable events that people look forward to each year.\n\nAs we look back on Neil Patrick Harris's hot streak, it's clear that he has transcended the boundaries of traditional hosting, becoming a modern-day Johnny Carson for a new generation. His passion, dedication, and undeniable charisma will undoubtedly continue to captivate audiences for years to come, ensuring that the spirit of award-show entertainment lives on in the most magical way possible.", "token_usage": 687, "human_written_evidences": ["– the reviews are in for last night ' s emmy awards , and they are not good .

This year’s show averaged 5.9 million viewers, down from 7.4 million last year, and roughly a half-million short of the previous low recorded in 2020, a virtual ceremony mounted during the pre-vaccine stage of the coronavirus pandemic. A few caveats apply, including the fact that the Emmys – which rotate among the four major broadcast networks – shifted to Monday night from Sunday, as they do whenever the show is carried by NBC because of the conflict with “Sunday Night Football.” Emmy ratings usually take a hit during those NBC years, and the competition included a highly competitive NFL game between the Denver Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks that averaged more than 10 million viewers. Still, to underscore how steadily and steeply viewing of the award ceremonies has fallen, the Emmys averaged 10.2 million viewers the last time that NBC broadcast them in 2018. All the major award shows took a steep hit in 2020, but most exhibited some ratings rebound. The Oscars, for example, grew by more than 50% in March after plummeting to a record low the previous year. As has become common, the Emmys were largely awarded to streaming and premium TV programs that generally attract smaller audiences than the most popular broadcast shows, even with the decline in viewership of linear TV. That dynamic is perceived as a contributing factor in the steady ratings erosion, reducing the rooting interest of viewers whose attention is scattered among an abundance of options. HBO’s “Succession” and “The White Lotus” nabbed two of the top prizes, with the third going to Apple TV+’s comedy “Ted Lasso” for the second consecutive year. (HBO and CNN are both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.) This year’s Emmys featured relatively little discussion of politics, which is frequently cited as turning off some viewers. Critics were generally unimpressed with the telecast, which was hosted by longtime “Saturday Night Live” cast member Kenan Thompson. © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

It is a confusing but often entertaining time to watch television. Appropriately, the 2022 Emmy Awards honoring all that television was also a confusing, often entertaining experience. After a largely virtual ceremony in 2020 and one held half-indoors and half-outdoors because of a rise in COVID-19 cases in 2021, this was the first “normal” Emmy Awards in three years. And it was normal in a lot of ways. Host Kenan Thompson kicked it off with a splashy, corny musical salute to famous TV shows of the past like Friends and The Brady Bunch (while highlighting the lack of Black characters in said shows). The Saturday Night Live veteran did a fairly by-the-numbers opening monologue, quipping, “If it weren’t for TV, what would we do, read books?” — a timely acknowledgment of how much content exists in 2022 and also a joke that might actually have been told at an Emmys ceremony in the early 1950s. As always, there was an “In Memoriam” segment that paid tasteful tribute to TV legends who died during the past year, and in keeping with awards-season protocol, John Legend provided its soundtrack. At its core, this was a traditional Emmy Awards that did the things we are accustomed to seeing at the Emmys. ﻿Elaborately dressed actors and creators accepted trophies, some of them well deserved (Sheryl Lee Ralph!), some of them less so (a directing award for a Ted Lasso episode instead of that episode of Barry with the motorcycle chase?). A lot of those trophies went to shows that have won before — Ted Lasso, Succession, Last Week Tonight With John Oliver (which nabbed Outstanding Variety Talk Series for the seventh consecutive year), and Saturday Night Live (named Outstanding Variety Sketch Series for the sixth year in a row). As a limited series, The White Lotus had never received an Emmy before, but going into the awards, it was easy to imagine the elitist critique dominating the limited-series lane, and that’s exactly what it did. Did I mention this Outstanding Limited Series is coming back this fall for a second season? Yeah, the Emmys don’t make sense sometimes. But they’re also a type of comfort TV, like a reboot of a familiar property in which we know which characters will emerge triumphant but we still watch anyway. At the same time, this Emmys ceremony, broadcast on NBC on a Monday night due to the immovability of Sunday Night Football, felt more chaotic than usual. There was a sense that the voters, as well as the producers, had decided to try some things. Some fresh series centering historically underrepresented voices were honored, including Abbott Elementary (it won for writing and Ralph as supporting actress), Squid Game (it won for directing and lead actor Lee Jung-jae) and Lizzo’s Watch Out for the Big Grrrls, which beat longtime fave RuPaul’s Drag Race in the Outstanding Reality Competition category. And while a lot of the major winners were predictable, this year’s awards also reflected the wide spectrum of places to find good television. For the first time in nearly a decade, a network sitcom, ABC’s Abbott Elementary, won the award for Outstanding Comedy Writing. While HBO scored more Emmys than anybody else, which is often the case, high-profile prizes went to shows on AppleTV+, Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and NBC, a snapshot of how broad our television-consumption habits have become. Like a streaming platform fine-tuning its user interface, the telecast itself introduced some new features. Chyrons highlighting messages from the winners appeared at the bottom of the screen during many acceptance speeches, an approach that allowed them to thank all the people they wanted without wasting precious airtime saying all those names. This was not a bad idea, though it did add another layer of information to absorb on top of all the other elements being thrown at us, in particular the music overseen by Zedd, who apparently decided that playing TV theme songs relevant to the winners was not good enough for the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards and instead seemingly selected whatever random track was cued up in his Spotify Emmys playlist. The rare time Zedd played something perfectly evocative of the past year in TV — Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” — it came during a moment that had absolutely nothing to do with Stranger Things. The Emmys also decided that advertising would no longer be limited to the commercial breaks, which is why we got an extended bit that was actually an ad for the Kia Telluride X-Pro and Jake Lacy hanging backstage to tout his upcoming role in the Peacock series A Friend of the Family. These served as reminders that, as much as television is about great storytelling and allowing audiences to feel seen, it’s also being made in an environment where every network and streaming conglomerate is more desperate than ever for money and eyeballs. I doubt this is the last Emmys broadcast in which we’ll see this kind of sneak-attack advertising. Come 2024, expect the Outstanding Drama Series to be sponsored by Pepsi. In other words, the Emmys felt different and the same, filled with familiar characters as well as shout-outs to shows that some people didn’t even know existed. (I won’t reveal how many Vulture staffers were not aware that Lizzo has a reality show on Prime Video, but it was more than one, and I am certain they were not alone.) Like listening to Jennifer Coolidge, a winner for her role in The White Lotus, talk about how a lavender bath earlier in the evening had caused her to “swell up in her dress,” the ceremony was a lot. But like Coolidge getting cut off before she could finish that perfectly Coolidge-ian speech, it also made us want more. Similar to peak TV at its apex, the Emmys was a little too much too fast — the broadcast sailed through 25 categories last night, one more than we typically see at the Academy Awards, and still finished right on time at 11 p.m. ET. But within that flurry of activity, the Emmys captured some unexpected, truly sublime moments. Undeniably the most sublime of all was Ralph’s acceptance speech, when she launched into “Endangered Species,” using every molecule of oxygen in her lungs to celebrate her first Emmy win after years of working on the stage and screen. It was emotional, inspirational, the sort of spontaneous expression that makes you appreciate what it’s like to watch a talent be overtaken by their gift on live television. You had to sit through a lot of random song choices by Zedd and jokes about how Netflix is poor now to get to stuff like that. But that’s how TV in 2022 works, isn’t it?

This exquisite artifact, with its intricate design and historical significance, transported visitors back in time to the Wild West era.\n\nThe 1873 Carson City dime, a shining example of America's monetary heritage, is an invaluable addition to any numismatic collection. Born in the bustling mining town of Carson City, the mint there was established in 1870 specifically to produce coins containing precious metals mined locally. During this period, Nevada's rich silver veins were at the forefront of the nation's economic development, and the mint played a crucial role in circulating these valuable coins across the country.\n\nThe dime, minted from 90% silver and 10% copper, features a design that is both distinctive and reflective of its era. On one side, a profile of Lady Liberty, adorned with a protective liberty cap, stands tall, symbolizing freedom and democracy. The reverse side displays the national shield, a nod to the country's strength and unity, supported by arrows and an oak branch – a fitting tribute to the nation's reliance on its natural resources and pioneer spirit.\n\nWhat sets this particular 1873 Carson City dime apart is its rarity. Due to the limited production and its relatively short circulation, these coins are highly sought after by collectors and historians alike. The mint closed its doors in 1878, leaving behind a small but significant legacy of coins minted during its existence. Any surviving specimen, like the one displayed on August 10th, is a precious testament to the region's past and the nation's economic milestones.\n\nAs visitors marveled at the intricacies of the coin, the display became not just an exhibition of a rare coin but also a living lesson in history. It provided a tangible connection to the stories of the miners who worked tirelessly in the Nevada silver mines and the craftsmen who minted the coins that once circulated in local stores, bars, and homes.\n\nThe event served as a reminder of the importance of preserving and appreciating history, as it showcased the role that even an everyday coin can play in understanding the past. The 1873 Carson City dime, with its fascinating backstory, was not just a coin but a piece of Nevada's rich cultural heritage that captured the imagination of all who had the privilege to witness it.\n\nIn conclusion, the display of the 1873 dime from Carson City, Nevada, on that August 10th was much more than a simple exhibit. It was a time capsule, holding within its worn edges the echoes of a bygone era, and a tangible link to the nation's past. As visitors left the display, they carried with them a newfound appreciation for the history etched on that humble yet illustrious coin.", "token_usage": 621, "human_written_evidences": ["– a one-of-a-kind dime minted in 1873 sold for $ 1.6 million at a philadelphia auction last night , reports ap . the coin depicts a seated lady liberty , and it is thought to be the lone survivor from a one-day minting of dimes at the renowned ( in coin circles , anyway ) mint in carson city , nevada . another 110 coins also went up for auction , one of each coin minted in carson city before its facility closed in 1893. total haul : $ 10 million . total face value of the coins : about $ 600 , according to usa today , which has more explanation on why collectors were so bowled over .\n"], "reference_documents": ["an 1873 dime from carson city , nev. , is displayed on friday , aug. 10 , 2012 , in philadelphia . the dime sold at auction for $ 1.84 million . it ' s part of the battle born collection , which contained one of ...

(August 14, 2012) — Leading international rare coin auction house Stack’s Bowers Galleries conducted one of the most highly-anticipated events in numismatic auction history on August 9, 2012, with a record-setting numismatic collection, the Battle Born Collection of Carson City Mint Coinage. The highlight of the night was the coveted ‘1873-CC No Arrows Liberty Seated’ dime, which sold for a record $1.84 million USD – the most expensive dime ever sold at auction. Attended by nearly 250 enthusiasts, collectors, investors and dealers and resulting in nearly $10 million in total sales, the auction of the Battle Born Collection took place as part of the Stack’s Bowers Galleries ‘Rarities Night Auction’ at the American Numismatic Association (ANA) World’s Fair of Money held at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia. The Unique 1873-CC No Arrows Liberty Seated dime, graded MS-65 by PCGS and pedigreed to the famous Louis E. Eliasberg, Sr. Collection, is the only example known to exist; it is the “holy grail” among collectors of the extremely popular Carson City Mint. It is now the most expensive circulation strike federal silver coin sold at auction, the most expensive Liberty Seated coin sold at auction, and the most expensive Carson City Mint coin ever sold at auction. “Most coins from the Carson City Mint were used solely for commerce,” says Chris Napolitano, president of Stack’s Bowers Galleries. “The mint existed from 1870-1893, and at that time most people were just trying to survive. Coin collecting was a hobby ill-suited to those forging a new West.” Today, coins from the Carson City Mint are highly valued and widely collected due to their rarity and historical significance. Most Carson City Mint coinage issues were originally produced in very limited numbers, and the surviving coins form an indelible link to the romance and history of the American West. As a unique rarity, the 1873-CC No Arrows dime is of even further importance, and its presence in the Stack’s Bowers Galleries 2012 Philadelphia ANA Auction created additional excitement. Rusty Goe, chief architect of the Battle Born Collection over the last 11 years, purchased the unique 1873-CC No Arrows dime in 2004 for $891,250 from a Bowers and Merena auction. He later sold it into the Battle Born Collection, thus completing the collection. “The sale of the Battle Born Collection is the most significant event in the history of Carson City Mint coin collecting,” commented Goe. “It sets a new standard of excellence in numismatics, and pays homage to the history, legacy and lore of the famed Carson City Mint. The Battle Born Collection appeals to not only Carson City Mint collectors, in fact, but gold coin enthusiasts, specialists in silver coins such as Liberty Seated and Morgan silver dollars, and more generalized collectors with an appreciation for the history of the coinage of the Old West.” The Battle Born Collection is one of just two complete sets of Carson City Mint coinage ever assembled, and it is the only one ever to be sold intact in one auction. All 111 regular issue Carson City Mint coins were sold as part of the Battle Born Collection, including the legendary and unique 1873-CC No Arrows Liberty Seated dime. The Battle Born Collection was sold ‘without reserve,’ meaning all 111 coins were sold to the highest bidders. “The sale of this dime was incredibly exciting,” says Napolitano. “People from all around the world participated in the Rarities Night auction, in person, over the phone, and online through the Internet. There were a few bidders continuing their bids after the million-dollar mark, which kept everyone in the room on the edge of their seats. To be a part of this history making occasion of selling the most expensive dime ever sold at auction is nothing short of extraordinary!” The Battle Born Collection, in particular, certainly saw spirited bidding, as the coins in this collection are so rare and desirable that their inclusion in this year’s ANA World’s Fair of Money Auction represented a once-in-a-lifetime bidding opportunity for many Carson City Mint, silver dollar, and gold coin enthusiasts. Stack’s Bowers Galleries’ official 2012 Philadelphia ANA Auction started on August 4 and ran through August 10. The live auction featured more than 5,500 lots of U.S. coins and paper money, in addition to the approximately 1,300 lots of world paper money and coins presented by Stack’s Bowers and Ponterio. Stack’s Bowers Galleries is currently accepting consignments for the Official Auction of the November 2012 Whitman Coin & Collectibles Baltimore Expo and the January 2013 Americana Sale. Stack’s Bowers Galleries is also the Official Auctioneer of the August 2013 ANA World’s Fair of Money that will take place in Chicago, and we are currently accepting consignments for that event, as well. About Stack’s Bowers Galleries Stack’s Bowers Galleries, a division of Fortune 500 Company Spectrum Group International Inc., was launched in January 2011, combining the extraordinary histories of Stack’s, the oldest rare coin auction and retail company in America, with Bowers and Merena Auctions, one of the world’s pre-eminent auctioneers of rare coins and paper money.

Ford, Jr. and Louis E. Eliasberg, Sr. collections, the Harry W. Bass, Jr. Collection, and the Norweb Collection, to name just a few. Topping off this amazing numismatic history is the inclusion of the world record for the highest price ever realized at auction for a rare coin; the legendary 1933 Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle that realized an astounding $7.59 million (sold in partnership with Sotheby’s). The company is headquartered in Irvine, California, with offices in New York, New Hampshire, and Hong Kong.

This finding challenges conventional wisdom that non-traditional relationship structures guarantee heightened sexual experiences.\n\nExploring the Study\n\nThe groundbreaking study, which surveyed a diverse range of participants from various types of intimate relationships, sought to delve into the complex dynamics of sexual satisfaction in unconventional relationships. The researchers analyzed data from thousands of individuals, including those in monogamous, polyamorous, and swinging relationships, to derive a comprehensive understanding.\n\nContrary to assumptions that multiple partners might lead to increased sexual exploration and variety, the study revealed that sexual satisfaction often depends on a multitude of factors beyond the number of partners. Factors such as effective communication, emotional openness, trust, and negotiation within the relationships were found to be key determinants of sexual happiness.\n\nSexual Dynamics in Open Relationships\n\nOpen relationships, where individuals have the freedom to pursue romantic or sexual connections outside their primary partnership, often emphasize communication and consent. The study found that when these foundations were in place, open relationships did not necessarily equate to increased sexual satisfaction. Instead, a strong emotional bond was found to be a more significant predictor of sexual fulfillment.\n\nPolyamorous Relationships: A Different Perspective\n\nIn polyamorous relationships, where individuals may have multiple romantic and sexual partners simultaneously, the study discovered that satisfaction was not solely dependent on the quantity of partners. Instead, it emphasized the importance of open communication, clear boundaries, and emotional maturity among all involved parties. It was found that when these elements were cultivated, polyamorous relationships could foster a deep sense of connection and sexual exploration without compromising satisfaction.\n\nThe Importance of Emotional Intimacy\n\nWhat the research consistently highlighted was the centrality of emotional intimacy in determining sexual satisfaction. Regardless of relationship structure, individuals who prioritized emotional closeness and connection with their partners, be it one or multiple, experienced higher levels of sexual happiness.\n\nChallenging Stereotypes and Expectations\n\nThis study serves as a reminder that sexual satisfaction is not a straightforward metric that can be traced solely to the number of partners or the nature of the relationship. It calls for a shift in societal attitudes and expectations, acknowledging that sexual fulfillment is a deeply personal and nuanced experience influenced by factors beyond the confines of traditional relationship dynamics.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the study's findings challenge the notion that open or polyamorous relationships inherently equate to heightened sexual satisfaction. Sexual satisfaction is a multifaceted aspect that depends on factors such as communication, trust, and emotional intimacy, regardless of relationship structure. As we continue to explore and understand the intricacies of modern relationships, it is crucial to recognize that happiness in the bedroom is not a one-size-fits-all formula.", "token_usage": 609, "human_written_evidences": ["– feel like monogamy is keeping you from an exciting sex life ? take note : an open relationship , with the potential for more sexual partners , does not necessarily mean you ' ll be more sexually satisfied . that ' s according to a survey of more than 11,000 people from 28 european countries , aged 18 to 65. in the survey conducted by german research company dalia in march , 82 % of monogamous couples and 80 % of married couples reported that they were sexually satisfied , compared to 71 % of couples in an open or polyamorous relationship and fewer than half of singles , reports quartz . other than singles who are \" looking , \" those in open relationships were actually the most likely to be unsatisfied sexually . some 22 % said they weren ' t sexually satisfied , compared to 12 % of married participants and 11 % of monogamous respondents . interestingly , a university of michigan survey of some 2,000 people over 25 , published in march , found heterosexuals in open relationships were significantly less satisfied with their relationship overall than those in monogamous relationships , reported michigan live . on the flip side , though , those in polyamorous relationships reported having higher levels of trust and lower levels of jealousy than their monogamous counterparts . that left researchers to conclude that there is \" no net benefit of one relationship style over another . \" ( americans appear to be having trouble in the bedroom. )\n"], "reference_documents": ["and , contrary to popular belief , people in open or polyamorous relationships aren ’ t more sexually satisfied : 71 % of people in polyamorous or open relationships are satisfied with their sex life compared to 82 % of people in monogamous relationships and 80 % of people who are married , in civil unions or partnerships . the least sexually satisfied people are those who are single and looking for a relationship ; only 40 % are satisfied . single people are also more likely to choose not to divulge information about their sex life . the survey also shows that general satisfaction increases with age among men but stays relatively stable among women . however , for both men and women , 25-30 year olds are most likely to report that they are ‘very satisfied ’ with their sex life .

Creating a successful open relationship requires top-notch communication, trust, and clear boundaries. Not everyone craves the traditional monogamous relationship. For some people, relationship satisfaction requires more diversity. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to explore your sexuality with multiple people. When you care about your primary partner and don’t want to lose that connection, creating an open relationship becomes an ethical option for both people. But in order for open relationships to work clear communication, boundaries, and expectations are essential. On the surface, an open relationship is one where you and your partner agree to allow sexual encounters with other people. “Open relationships are sometimes referred to as ‘monogamish,’” explains Ashera DeRosa, owner and licensed marriage and family therapist at Whole Stories Therapy, Buffalo, New York. “They fall under the ENM (ethically non-monogamous) umbrella.” ENM, or consensual non-monogamy (CNM), relationships are those where multiple partners are mutually agreed upon and allowed, under various relationship structures, like swinging or polyamory. The honesty in an open relationship is what sets it apart from infidelity, or cheating, where other intimate connections are kept secret. Consensual non-monogamy is more common than most people realize. According to research from 2017, approximately 1 out of every 5 single adults in the United States have participated in a CNM relationship at some point in their lives. According to DeRosa, what sets an open relationship apart from polyamory is the relationship hierarchy. “An open relationship is generally a couple that maintains a strong emotional bond with one another that may explore sexually with others, often under certain circumstances,” she says. “With polyamory, we tend to see emotional and sexual relationships with multiple partners.” In an open relationship, your primary partner has the majority share of your emotions and commitment. In polyamory, you may develop the same deep level of emotional and physical intimacy with multiple people. There’s no clear evidence to suggest open relationships fail more than monogamous ones, even though that’s the common assumption. You can feel secure, valued, and loved in an open relationship just as you can in a monogamous one. “How are we measuring success? The vast majority of relationships fail,” DeRosa points out. “Relationship structures are only as healthy as the participants. If everyone involved is communicating effectively and being proactive, I see no difference in outcome when it comes to structure.” Just like monogamous relationships, open relationships work through clear communication, boundaries, and trust. They can be successful when both partners understand the rules and there’s no sense of inequality. In the right open relationship, you may be able to obtain the perfect balance of emotional fulfillment and sexual fulfillment. Nicolle Dirksen, owner of Clover Counseling and sex and couples’ therapist from Owatonna, Minnesota, explains, “Much like any relationship structure, folks choose an open relationship for all kinds of reasons. Some people may be attracted to multiple genders and feel more fulfilled when they can explore relationships with genders different from their current partner.” In addition to sexual diversity, an open relationship may be appealing if you feel constrained by the cultural norm of monogamy, or if you have sexual fantasies your primary partner isn’t comfortable with. According to a longitudinal study from 2020, people are just as happy in CNM relationships as they are in monogamous ones. But an open relationship may have some specific relationship benefits, including: An open relationship isn’t without its pitfalls, especially if boundaries aren’t clear or both partners aren’t as invested in the idea of sexual intimacy with other people. Potential cons of an open relationship include: There’s no universal test that can determine if an open relationship is where you should be. To start, if you can’t stand the thought of sharing your primary partner or engaging in extra sexual encounters yourself, CNM might not be the right choice. Sophia Turner, a relationship and sex therapist from Chicago, Illinois says, “If you can check these boxes, an open relationship might be for you:” Clear, honest communication is the backbone of a successful open relationship. Taking the first step to discuss this relationship structure is a good indication of whether your communication skills can hold up in the long run. To help this conversation along, DeRosa, Dirksen, and Turner recommend the following tips: “If your partner says no, you may have to do some soul searching to determine how you want your future sex life and/or love life to look and begin having some tough conversations,” says Dirksen. Remember, an open relationship requires both people to be satisfied with the relationship structure. An open relationship is one where both parties agree to allow sexual relationships outside of the primary partnership. Like all relationships, an open relationship requires good communication, trust, and a clear understanding of what multiple sexual partners entail. If you feel you’d be happiest in an open relationship, talking about it honestly with your partner is the unavoidable first step.

A survey of 27,500 people, The Global Study of Sexual Attitudes and Behaviors (GSSAB; Laumann et al., 2006), found four components of sexual satisfaction: physical pleasure, emotional satisfaction, the importance of sex in one’s life, and satisfaction with sexual health and functioning. In a similar vein, relationship satisfaction can be defined as an affective response arising from a person’s subjective evaluation of the positive and negative dimensions associated with one’s romantic relationship.

A man, whose identity has been described as a local resident, walked into the heart of the courthouse complex, aiming to unleash chaos, and opened fire on a deputy, leaving the law enforcement officer gravely injured.\n\nAccording to preliminary reports, the incident occurred abruptly when the suspect entered the courthouse, apparently armed and prepared to take drastic action. As the deputy, who has not been named, went about their duties, the gunfire tore through the air, striking the unsuspecting officer in a harrowing scene that has left the community reeling.\n\nEmergency responders were swift to arrive on the scene, rendering aid to the injured deputy, who was quickly transported to a nearby hospital. The nature of the injuries is yet to be disclosed, but authorities are confirming the deputy's condition is serious, with hopes for a full recovery.\n\nLaw enforcement officers, including SWAT teams, swiftly sealed off the area, ensuring the safety of the remaining staff and visitors who were caught in the midst of this terrifying event. The suspect was apprehended without further incident, and law enforcement agencies are now working diligently to piece together the details of the motive behind the attack.\n\nThe Forrest County Courthouse, usually a place where justice is sought and upheld, now stands as a stark reminder of the vulnerability that exists even in the most secure environments. The incident has sparked an outpouring of support for the injured deputy and their family, as well as a community-wide concern for public safety.\n\nCounty officials have vowed to cooperate fully with the investigation, sharing information with local and federal law enforcement as needed.

All rights reserved.", "Thousands of protesters rallied outside the Georgian parliament on Sunday amid mounting opposition to the country's government. Critics accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of being under the sway of Russia and of backsliding on democracy. The government has been accused of jailing political opponents and silencing independent media. The rally was organised by the main opposition party in support of jailed former President Mikheil Saakashvili. Mr Saakashvili, who served two terms as president between 2004 and 2013, is currently serving a six-year jail term for abuse of power, although international rights groups have condemned his conviction as politically motivated. Last month, mass protests forced the government to abandon a bill that would have required any non-governmental organisation receiving money from abroad to register as an \"agent of foreign influence\". Opponents said the bill was modelled on one introduced in Russia in 2012 to suppress dissent and called it a step towards authoritarianism. The protests saw police use water cannon and pepper spray on attendees. On Sunday, demonstrators outside the parliament building in capital Tbilisi waved Georgian, Ukrainian and European Union flags and held a huge banner that read: \"For a European future\". Public opinion in Georgia is overwhelmingly pro-EU, and the government says it remains committed to the country's bid to join the bloc, but opponents say its actions are harming Georgia's chances of gaining membership. Georgia applied for EU membership along with Ukraine and Moldova days after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. In June, the EU formally named Ukraine and Moldova as candidate member states, but said Georgia must implement a number of political and judicial reforms before being given the status. Addressing the rally, Levan Khabeishvili, chair of the United National Movement party, which was founded by Mr Saakashvili, called for the \"liberation of political prisoners\" and the introduction of the reforms Brussels has asked for. Giorgi Margvelashvili, who succeeded Mr Saakashvili as president, told the crowd that the Georgian government was \"being controlled from Moscow and our obligation is to save our homeland from Russian stooges\". \"We are freedom-loving people, part of the European family, we reject Russian slavery,\" he said. One of the demonstrators, 27-year-old painter Luka Kavsadze, told the AFP news agency: \"Our struggle will be peaceful but uncompromised and will lead us to where we belong - the European Union.\" Recent months have seen Mr Saakashvili stage a number of hunger strikes, and his supporters have claimed he is being denied proper healthcare. Mr Saakashvili has also alleged he has been poisoned in prison, although Georgian authorities have accused him of feigning ill health to secure early release. In an article for the Politico website earlier this week Mr Saakashvili said he was dying from \"from a bewildering array of over 20 serious illnesses\".
