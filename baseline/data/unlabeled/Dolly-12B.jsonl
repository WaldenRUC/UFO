She found that people generally believe their intelligence or talents are fixed traits, which they cannot change. When these people fail to meet with success or expectations, they often withdraw from challenges or opportunities, blaming luck or external forces, instead of themselves.\n\nIn contrast, people who believe their abilities can be developed have a \"growth mindset\". According to Dweck, this mindset is \"very adaptive in the long run [and] leads to higher levels of motivation, perseverance, and well-being\".\n\nDweck's work has been covered by popular media, including the BBC, CNN, and TED.
