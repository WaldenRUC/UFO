Similarly, some individuals with XX chromosomes may develop male characteristics due to conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia.", "phrase": "Androgen insensitivity syndrome and congenital adrenal hyperplasia"}, {"question": "At what moment does the process of determining the gender of offspring begin?", "sentence": "The process of determining the gender of offspring begins at the moment of conception when a sperm fertilizes an egg.", "phrase": "At the moment of conception"}, {"question": "What do sperm and egg contain in relation to genetic material required to create a new individual?", "sentence": "Each sperm and egg contains half the genetic material required to create a new individual.", "phrase": "Half the genetic material"}, {"question": "What contributes to the diversity of human gender identities and expressions?", "sentence": "This intricate process, influenced by genetic and biological factors, contributes to the diversity of human gender identities and expressions.", "phrase": "The intricate process influenced by genetic and biological factors"}]}
