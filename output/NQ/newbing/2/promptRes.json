Directed by the multiple Academy Award winning luminary Robert Wise (who also directed \u2018West Side Story\u2019), the film boasted the talents of Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and was phenomenal commercial success, managing to rake in three hundred million dollars way back in the 1960s. Today, the legacy of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is irreproachable, having five Academy Awards to its name and enduring renown that continues to make the film relevant even today. Based on the 1959 stage musical of the same name (which in turn is based on the memoir \u201cThe Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u201d by Maria von Trapp), \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 follows the von Trapp family and their new governess Maria. Maria is a struggling nun who is assigned the job of taking care of the exceedingly mischievous seven von Trapp children. Their father, Georg von Trapp, is a retired naval captain who runs his household with military discipline after the death of his wife. While initially cold and hostile towards Maria, the von Trapp children eventually fall for her kind demeanor and melodious personality. Even the stoic captain finds himself falling for Maria affable charms but their idyllic lifestyle is threatened when the Nazis start to take over their country. If you were wondering what were \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 filming locations, read on. The backdrop for much of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is the charming pre World War II town of Salzburg in Austria during the 1930s. The scenery shows off distant snow-capped mountain peaks, verdant hilltops perfect for breaking into a spontaneous melody, and cultured medieval buildings that occupy the imagination. While it is possible to recreate these distinctive features of the region on a set as well, such a facsimile is unlikely to be nearly as authentic as the real thing. This is especially true of the 1960s when CGI wasn\u2019t really an option for filmmakers. Keeping this in mind, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 was largely filmed on location in Austria itself, specifically in the city of Salzburg. Limited filming for scenes was also done in studio in California, as well as a few scenes in Bavaria, Germany. Principal filming commenced in late March 1964 and concluded later that year in September.

The production started out with the filming of Maria\u2019s bedroom scenes as well as the nun Abbey cloister. Sketch artist Maurice Zuberano accompanied director Robert Wise to scout for locations in Austria. After a ten week period, Zuberano prepared a set of storyboards and location photos to art director Boris Leven, who designed and constructed the interior sets at Fox Studios in painstaking detail. It is on these sets that parts of the gazebo scenes in the wildly popular songs \u201cSomething Good\u201d and \u201cSixteen Going on Seventeen\u201d were filmed. The 20th century Fox Studios have served as the filming location for many world renowned films and TV shows including \u2018Modern Family\u2019, \u2018Fight Club\u2019, \u2018Edward Scissorhands\u2019, and \u2018Arrested Development\u2019. The majority of the filming for \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 took place in and around the delightful city of Salzburg in Austria. The wedding scenes were filmed at the Benedictine monastery of Mondsee Abbey in Upper Austria, with on location filming also done at Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and the Altstadt Old Town area of Salzburg.

Initially, the town leaders were opposed to Wise\u2019s use of Nazi Swastika banners in the background, which were fairly central to the film\u2019s plot.

Start Traveling. Austria \u2022 See & Do One of the most famous musical films, The Sound of Music, which was filmed in 1965 is still loved by many today. Each year hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Salzburg, Austria to walk in the footsteps of the legendary Von Trapp family. If you are a fan of the movie and wondering where the Sound of Music was filmed, you\u2019ve come to the right place. From the gazebo where Liesl sings \u201c16 going on 17\u201d to the Abbey where Maria lived and got married, here are all the must-visit Sound of Music filming locations. Recommendation: Relive the scenes of some of the most popular Sound of Music locations in Salzburg including Leopoldskron Palace, Nonnberg Abbey, and Mirabell Gardens on a guided Sound of Music tour. With an English speaking guide, and songs from the soundtrack playing throughout the tour, this Original Sound of Music tour from Salzburg won\u2019t disappoint! Marvel at the breathtaking locations for the Sound of Music and sing through the streets of Salzburg. Founded in 714 A.D., Nonnberg Abbey (German: Stift Nonnberg) is the oldest female convent north of the Alps and is where the real-life Maria became a novice nun and got married to Georg von Trapp. Nonnberg is where four scenes from the movie were filmed: the scene of the nuns singing \u201cMaria\u201d in the courtyard, Maria leaving the abbey, the kids visiting her at the abbey, and the Nazi\u2019s hunting the Von Trapps. Visitors will notice the interior of the Abbey is different from the movie, as filming inside the convent was not allowed, so the interior scenes were shot in a Hollywood studio. A highlight of this Sound of Music location in Salzburg is hearing the resident nuns Gregorian chants in Latin at 6:45 in the morning inside the beautiful Gothic abbey. The small yet beautiful flower filled St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery (German: Petersfriedhof) was the inspiration for the cemetery rebuilt on set for the scene towards the end of the movie in which the Von Trapps hide from the Nazis behind tombs. Beside being the resting place of Mozart\u2019s sister, Nannerl, this is also the resting place of Max Detweiler, \u201cUncle Max\u201d from the movie. This unique cemetery is one of the oldest (and most beautiful) cemeteries in the world and is Salzburg\u2019s oldest Christian cemetery. The catacombs carved out of the rocks of M\u00f6nchsberg provide a stunning view over the beautiful cemetery and should be visited during your Sound of Music tour in Salzburg. This baroque style garden, which was built in 1606 by the archbishop Wolf Dietrich for his mistress is a beautifully landscaped garden filled with gorgeous flowers, marble statues, fountains, and ample opportunities to reenact scenes from the movies. The iconic song, \u201cDo Re, Mi\u201d was partially shot here. While visiting Mirabell gardens, you\u2019ll relive the scene of Maria and the Von Trapp kids dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, jumping up and down the steps, as well as running through the hedge maze tunnel, all the while admiring the breathtaking view of Hohensalzburg Fortress in the distance. This film location spot, which can be visited for free, should not be missed. Situated in the center of Salzburg old town is Residence Square (German: Residenzplatz), which is home to the largest (45 feet tall) baroque fountain outside of Italy. It is in this square while singing \u201cI Have Confidence in Me\u201d, that Maria happily splashes water in the fountain, The Nazi soliders also march through the square later in the movie and hang their flag over the entrance of the old Residence Palace. Built in the 17th century to wash the horses of the prince-archbishop, the Horse Pond (German: Pferdeschwemme) was briefly featured in the movie as a backdrop to Maria and the kids singing \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d while dancing in their clothes made from curtains. In addition to being featured in the musical, the Horse Pond is well worth a visit in its own right. It is situation below the cliff side of M\u00f6nchsberg, and the bright fresco behind the horse pond makes for a gorgeous picture to add to your Sound of Music tour album. Carved into the M\u00f6nchsberg, the Rock Riding School (German: Felsenreitschule) was initially built to be a cathedral, but was later repurposed by the archbishop into a riding school where tournaments were held. Today it\u2019s Salzburg\u2019s most popular concert venue and is where the real Von Trapp family won the Sal\n\nquestion: Where was 'The Sound of Music' filmed?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Salzburg, Austria", "usage": 1066}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Fans will recognize this Sound of Music filming location from the scene where the Captain sings \u201cEdelweiss\u201d and his family joins him on stage to sing \u201cSo Long, Farewell\u201d. Frohnburg Palace played an important role in the Sound of Music as it was one of the two filming locations for the Von Trapp Villa. Once a private residence, the palace is now a Music Academy, the facade and large iron gate is where Maria first set her eyes on the Von Trapp family home towards the end of the song \u201cI Have Confidence\u201d. The Palace was also featured in the movie during the scenes in which the Captain rips the Nazi flag from above the doorway and during the family\u2019s attempt to escape from the Nazis by pushing their car silently out of the gate. Just outside the city center is Hellbrunn Palace, home to the Sound of Music gazebo. It was here that the most romantic scenes of the Sound of Music was captured; when Liesl gets her first kiss while singing \u201c16 going on 17.\u201d It is also where the Captain and Maria fall deeper in love with each other while singing \u201cSomething Good\u201d. Though visitors cannot go into the gazebo, they can dance, sing, and take as many pictures as they please around it. Make your visit to Hellbrunn even more exciting by taking a tour of the Trick Fountains at Hellbrunn Palace. The hour long tour takes you through grottoes, ponds, and walkways filled with trick fountains. Your ticket also lets you explore the inside of the palace. This is one of the best things to do in Salzburg and will be a memorable experience especially for the kids. Leopoldskron Palace is one of the most important filming location for the Sound of Music as the majestic palace and perfect lake view backdrop served as the primary filming location for all of the lake terrace scenes of the Von Trapp family home. This includes the scenes in which Maria and the kids fall off the boat into the lake, and when the Captain and Uncle Max are drinking pink lemonade on the terrace. Though the interior of the mansion was never filmed in the movie, the palace\u2019s gold Venetian ballroom and foyer were rebuilt in Hollywood for the interior scenes. Today the palace is a boutique hotel. Staying overnight is the only way to visit the film location up close and to get a peek into the Venetian ballroom. Staying here is the ultimate Sound of Music experience as you get to live in the home of the Von Trapp family in the film. You can book your stay at Leopoldskron Palace here. If you choose not to stay at the hotel, you can still view the Palace at a distance from the west side of the lake. Though not a filming location, the Von Trapp Villa is where the real Von Trapp family lived for 15 years. They managed to get onto a train at the nearby station to escape the Nazis one day before the Austrian borders were closed. Today the Von Trapp Villa operates as a hotel and an educational Sound of Music museum of the real Von Trapp family as well as behind the scenes information about the filming of the movie. Not far from Leopoldskron Palace, a visit to the Von Trapp Villa would give fans a true insight on the life of the legendary Von Trapp family that we have come to love. Fans can either book a stay at the Villa or simply visit on a guided tour which takes place every day and lasts about 45 minutes. Mt. Untersberg is depicted twice in the Sound of Music, once during the opening scene in which Maria is singing the \u201cSound of Music\u201d and again when the family is escaping over the mountain to Switzerland while singing \u201cClimb Every Mountain\u201d. Fans can easily access Mount Untersberg from Salzburg via bus and get to the top via cable car. More adventurous travelers can hike 2 hours to the top. At 1,853 meters above the Salzburg basin, Mt. Untersberg offers breaktaking views over the region and is worth the day trip from Salzburg. Less than an hour bus drive from Salzburg is the picturesque lakeside town Mondsee. There you can visit the beautiful Collegiate Church of St. Michael where Maria and Georg von Trapp got married in the movie. This is a must-see for any Sound of Music fan. Make a full-day trip out of the location and stroll through the town, take a refreshing dip in the lake, hike up the nearby forest, and eat delicious seafood along the lake. In the opening scene of the movie you get a gorgeous aerial view of the village of St. Gilgen and the popular lake, Wolfgangsee. The village and lake can easily be reached by train. Want to have a picnic on the hills while singing \u201cDo Re Mi\n\nquestion: Where was 'The Sound of Music' filmed?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Salzburg, Hellbrunn Palace, Leopoldskron Palace, Mt.

The short 1.4km hike from the Werfen town takes about half an hour to complete. Once at the top you can enjoy a picnic and breathtaking views of the surrounding areas and the Hohenwerfen Fortress. Make your trip to Werfen a full day adventure by visiting both the Hohenwerfen Fortress and the largest ice cave in the world, Eisriesenwelt. Both sights will be a welcome addition to your Salzburg itinerary. Situated just across the German border, atop the magnificent Rossfeld mountain, is the Rossfeld Panoramic Road which was used in the movie to show the safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain. The private road, Rossfeld Panoramic Road is the only filming location that\u2019s difficult to get to without a car. If you don\u2019t have a car, it is recommended to visit the nearby Untersberg Mountain to get just as spectacular views with easier accessibility. Well there you have it, the top must-visit Sound of Music filming location in and around Salzburg. All locations can be visited on your own, but if you don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle or you have limited time, consider taking a guided Sound of Music tour from Salzburg or Vienna. And to make your Sound of Music trip even more memorable, spend a night or two at the home of the Von Trapp family in the film; Hotel Schloss Leopoldskron, or in the home of the real Von Trapp family at Villa Trapp. Either one will take your trip from amazing to extraordinary. Waseem says 1 month ago The Sound of Music gazebo at Hellbrunn Palace in Salzburg was moved here from its original location at Schloss Leopoldskron. Allan Trivette says 5 months ago The writer/compiler of this page shows an obvious love for the film. I was put under a \u201cSound of Music\u201d spell at the age of 10 when the film first came out, and I\u2019m still spellbound to this day. I\u2019ve visited Salzburg 5 times, and I can\u2019t wait to go back again. But, there are a few errors on this page that need to be clarified and/or corrected. First \u2013 #7 Frohnburg Palace \u2013 the writer of this article is correct \u2013 it WAS used as the von Trapp home in the film. However, what we see in the film as the FRONT of the von Trapp home is actually the BACK of Frohnburg! The FRONT of Frohnburg was used as the BACK of the von Trapp home in the film! The back of the home is seen when Rolf comes to deliver a telegram and the Captain takes it abruptly and tells him to leave. You see it also when the pink lemonade is served. Now, to make this even more complicated, the back of the film home looking toward the lake: the canoe flipping, the Baroness and the Captain strolling by the lake, Leisl running out to meet Rolf, Maria\u2019s return when she comes back from the Abbey, etc., is located to the left of Schloss Leopoldskron. I\u2019ll write more about this below. #8 \u2013 Hellbrun Palace (the gazebo) \u2013 correction \u2013 NONE of the gazebo scenes (\u201c16 Going on 17\u201d and \u201cSomething Good\u201d) were shot anywhere near the gazebo. It was a set in Hollywood. The only time we see the gazebo that is at Hellbrun is when the Captain and the Baroness take their stroll by the lake (just before the canoe flipping). It can be seen briefly in the background during their stroll. #9 \u2013 Leopoldskron Palace \u2013 was NOT used at ALL at any time during the filming!! The production company DID want to film the lake scenes there, but the officials of the Palace at that time wanted too much money. They did, however, offer the company the use of the \u201cside lawn\u201d. If you look at the photo of the Palace on this page, the side lawn is not seen, but it is to the left of the photo\u2019s edge. The \u201cOfficial Sound of Music Tour\u201d guides will show you the Schloss and point out the original horse-headed statues and lake gate and tell you that is where those scenes were filmed. WRONG!!! The \u201clake-gate\u201d and the horse-headed fish statues, were recreated by 20th Century-Fox and erected on the \u201cside lawn\u201d where the Meierhof is now located. The Meierhof used to be the administrative offices for the Palace, but it\n\nquestion: Where was 'The Sound of Music' filmed?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Austria, the Rossfeld Panoramic Road, and Hellbrun Palace in Salzburg, as well as the home of the Von Trapp family seen in the movie.", "usage": 1087}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If one enters the main gate for the Schloss, the Schloss is to the left and the Meierhof is to the right. Walking straight from the gate to the lake one will see the pedestals for the horse-headed statues are still there. As was stated by the writer, the Venetian Room is in the Schloss and was used as the inspiration for the ballroom in the film. #11 \u2013 Mount Untersberg \u2013 clarification \u2013 the mount is seen several times in the background of several scenes, but NO SCENES were filmed ON it. #15 \u2013 Rossfeld Mountain \u2013 clarification \u2013 again, \u201cthe safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain\u201d is inaccurate. That \u201cescape\u201d scene was filmed just off the Rossfeld Panoramastrasse. There is a roadside cafe/restaurant on the Panoramastrasse called the Ahornkaser (they serve the best Apple Strudel you\u2019ll ever have). Standing in front of the Ahornkaser, there is a path on the right side of the building. Take that path about 400 feet and look up to your right. At the top of the hill is the exact spot where the von Trapps cross the mountain to freedom as \u201cClimb Ev\u2019ry Mountain\u201d is sung. At the end of that scene, with that open vista lying before them, you can see the Untersberg in the distance. I hope this helps/informs anyone planning on making a visit. Negar Modgeddi says 1 month ago I LOVE your notations about the actual places and your very thoughtful corrections! Melanie says 6 months ago Thank you for this great information! Do you know which field Maria was walking in during the opening scene? I know it was Untersberg Mountain in the background, but I can\u2019t find any information on the field she was frolicking through to get that sweeping view. Any pointers you can offer would be most appreciated! Ben says 6 months ago The opening scene was filmed on Mehlweg meadow which is not open to the public. Frans says 2 years ago The horsepond also features in a scene where Liesl runs into Rolf on his bike. lucy says 2 years ago This has been the most helpful and clear information i\u2019ve found about the filming locations thanks so much Your email address will not be published.

The opening aerial shots are Salzburg\u2019s glorious Lake District, the Salzkammergut. The castles you can see are Kloster H\u00f6glw\u00f6rth, an old monastery on a peninsula in H\u00f6glw\u00f6rther See; and Schloss Anif, off E55 a few miles south of Salzburg. The mountain, atop which Maria (Julie Andrews) makes her first twirling appearance, is Mehlweg, near the Bavarian village of Markt Schellenberg, about six miles from Salzburg. Don\u2019t be too disappointed \u2013 the birch trees and the babbling brook were added for the movie. Convent interiors were recreated in the studio, but the exterior really is Maria\u2019s abbey. It\u2019s Nonnberg Abbey, Nonnberg Gasse, where you can visit the courtyard and peek inside the chapel (which looks nothing like the interior recreated back in Hollywood). The film cheats a little with the exterior, too. As you\u2019ll find if you visit, the real Nonnberg Abbey doesn\u2019t look out over the picturesque old town of Salzburg, but to the nondescript southern suburbs. The reverse shot, of Maria leaving the abbey, filmed way across the city on the Humboldt Terrace (seen later in the Do Re Mi number), in front of the Museum of Modern Art, which since 2002 has stood atop M\u00f6nchsberg Cliffs on the site of the old Cafe Winkler. As Maria leaves to take up her post with the Von Trapp family, I Have Confidence in Me was filmed in Salzburg\u2019s Old Town, in the Residenzplatz, where you\u2019ll see the Domplatz arches, through which Maria enters, and the Residenz Fountain, in which she splashes. The \u2018Villa Von Trapp\u2019 is a combination of two different Salzburg locations. The tree-shaded lane, where Maria alights from the bus, is Hellbrunner Allee, running south from the old town. Here you\u2019ll recognise Schloss Frohnburg, a 17th century country house, now the Mozarteum Music Academy, which was used for the intimidating gates and front entrance of the villa which Maria nervously approaches. The lakeside terrace, though, was filmed at Schloss Leopoldskron, a rococo castle on Leopoldskroner Teich, a small artificial lake on the southwest of the town. You can view Leopoldskron across the lake from K\u00f6nig Ludwig Strasse, but it's now \u2013 hurrah! \u2013 a hotel. Leopoldskron's extravagantly gilt Venetian Room was replicated in the studio in Hollywood. Incidentally, the famous gazebo originally stood on the palace's grounds, when it was a private villa, but was moved to a more accessible location. The real Villa Trapp, by the way, is in Aigen, a suburb just to the southeast of the Old Town of Salzburg. Since 2008, it\u2019s been open as a hotel, Villa Trapp, Traunstra\u00dfe 34, 5026 Salzburg. There\u2019s a rail service to Bahnhof Aigen. The little footbridge over which the von Trapps skip at the beginning of the My Favourite Things montage of Salzburg is Mozart Steg, north of Mozart Platz. They quickly move on to Domplatz, in front of Salzburger Dom (Salzburg Cathedral); Kapitelschwemme, the Baroque horse pond once used for watering and cleaning horses, in Herbert von Karajan Platz; and the market on Kajetanerplatz, just north of Nonnberg Abbey, where Maria demonstrates her tomato juggling skills. They finally head off for a picnic in the meadow above the village of Werfen, 25 miles south of Salzburg in the Salzach River valley (where you can also visit the castle from wartime action movie Where Eagles Dare). Do-Re-Mi begins at the picnic, returning to Salzburg atop the Monchsberg Cliffs, on Humboldt Terrace which you can reach from the Monchsberg elevator in Anton Neumayrplatz, at the end of the Gstattengasse shopping street, and continuing with a carriage ride south from St Erhard Kirche, the Parish Church of St Erhard, along Nonntaler Hauptstra\u00dfe,\n\nquestion: Where was 'The Sound of Music' filmed?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Austria and California", "usage": 1040}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The number climaxes at Mirabell Gardens, on Schwarzstrasse, over the Salzach River behind Schloss Mirabell, where you\u2019ll find the fountains, statues and, famously, the flight of steps on which the children hop. The Von Trapp gazebo, used for Sixteen Going On Seventeen, once stood in the grounds of Leopoldskron, but constant trespassing resulted in it being moved and reconstructed in the ornamental gardens of Schloss Hellbrunn, Morzger Strasse, toward the south of Salzburg. And another cheat. It was recreated, slightly larger, back at 20th Century-Fox in Hollywood for the interior shots. Maria\u2019s wedding, which took place in Nonnberg Abbey, was filmed in the baroque, twin-towered St Michael\u2019s Church, Wredeplatz, in Mondsee, about 15 miles east of Salzburg on the E55/E60. The Anschluss scene, Austria\u2019s enforced unity with Nazi Germany, was staged back in the centre of Salzburg itself in Residenzplatz. The music festival, at which the von Trapp family perform their disappearing act, is at the Felsenreitschule (\u2018Rock Riding School\u2019), Hofstallgasse 1, a 1400-seat theatre built in what was a rock quarry for Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun in 1693, and used as the archbishop's riding school. It\u2019s one of the sites of the Salzburg Festival. Despite what some overenthusiastic tour guides might tell you, the cemetery in which the von Trapps hide from the Nazis is a Hollywood studio set, though its design is clearly based on St Peter\u2019s Graveyard, which you can see just off Kapitelplatz. The mountain over which the family finally escapes to freedom is above the village of Obersalzburg with views of the Untersberg in the distance, near the village of Rossfeld, on the 319, 12 miles south of Salzburg. \u2022 Many thanks to Lieselotte Mayrhofer; and to Bryan Crawford of Edelweiss Tours for help with this section.

Adapted from the 1959 stage musical of the same name, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is actually based on the memoir, titled \u2018The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u2019. The story deals with a postulant, who goes to the imposing home of a retired naval officer. The man is a widower, and the young woman acts as a governess to his children. Soon enough, she brings music and love to the entire family, and it is not long before she falls in love with her employer as well. Together they band, as they have to face the loss of their motherland to the Nazis. If you have seen the movie, you already know that it takes place in Salzburg in Austria. Over the course of the film, there are several iconic scenes that have been shot at picturesque locations, or there are some locations that have been simply elevated due to the value of the scene itself (think of the gazebo where \u2018Sixteen Going on Seventeen\u2019 is performed). Naturally, you might be wondering about the exact filming locations of this popular movie, and we have got you covered in that regard. When \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 started filming, the crew did not head immediately to the real locations for the movie. Instead, when principal photography began on March 26, 1964, it started at the 20th Century Fox studios located in Los Angeles. Following this, the crew headed to Salzburg, where they filmed at a variety of locations including the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and Residence Fountain, among others. Filming commenced here from April 23, to around May 22. Various other locations nearby were used, and shooting went on till around June 19. The crew also hit up places nearby including Werfen in the Salzach River valley. Some scenes were also shot in Bavaria, with the Alps serving as a wonderful backdrop. Around July 6, the team headed back to Los Angeles for the remaining scenes, and principal photography ultimately wrapped up by September 1, 1964. As is evident, a plethora of locations have been hit in this frenzied shooting schedule, and we now proceed to the specific filming locations, rendered memorable by the iconic scenes that have unfolded there. Salzburg in Austria serves as the place where most of the pivotal scenes of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place. Some of the most recognizable locations include Mirabell Palace and Gardens. If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you must know that \u2018Do re mi\u2019 is one of the most popular songs. The ending of this song sees Maria and the von Trapp kids at the Mirabell Palace and Gardens. Located in Salzburg\u2019s old town, we can see the movie characters dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, which is located in front of the palace. The other recognizable locations happen to be the rose garden at the north of the fountain and the Greek fencing statues at the entrance. Residenzplatz Square and Fountain also plays an important part, early on, as Maria can be seen splashing in the baroque horse fountain here, while \u2018I Have Confidence in Me\u2019 is playing. When Germany annexes Austria, we see Nazi soldiers marching through this square, while a Swastika flag is raised above the Old Residence Palace\u2019s entrance. The Summer Riding School (Felsenreitschule) is where the von Trapp family takes the stage, performing \u2018Edelweiss\u2019 and \u2018So long, Farewell\u2019, for the Folk Festival. Notably, hundreds of extras were hired for the scene to sing along. A little away from this location, on Herbert von Karajan Square, is the Horse Pond, where Maria and the children dance at the end of \u2018My Favorite Things\u2019. Leopoldskron Palace is important in its own way since all the lake terrace scenes of the von Trapp family home were shot here. Schloss Frohnburg was also used to show the von Trapp house, rather the intimidating front gates which Maria nervously approaches initially. Nonnberg Abbey Convent is where Maria lived, and the exteriors of the same have been used in the movie. However, the movie has taken some liberties here, as the convent does not actually look over the old town of Salzburg, but instead has a view of the nondescript southern suburbs. St. Michael Basilica in Mondsee, outside Salzburg, is remarkable because Maria gets married to Georg von Trapp, in one of the most famous scenes from the movie. Werfen, which is around a 40-minute drive away from Salzburg, has the Gschwandtanger Meadow, which\n\nquestion: Where was 'The Sound of Music' filmed?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Salzburg in Austria and Los Angeles in California", "usage": 1088}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Bavaria is important for being one of the first scenes where Maria makes her entrance. She can be seen twirling at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg. The sequence where the von Trapps escape the Nazis is also shot on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. Notably, Stage 8 and Stage 15 were used in the studios, but a lot of important scenes were shot there. Firstly, shooting inside the convent was not allowed, meaning that the set was created in the studio itself. The golden foyer and the ballroom, we see in the house, were also recreated in Hollywood. There is an important scene where the Von Trapp family hides from the Nazis behind some tombs. While the scenes have been recreated in Hollywood, they closely resemble St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery and Catacombs in Salzburg. The gazebo where two of the finest songs in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place, that is, \u2018Something Good\u2019 and \u201916 going on 17\u2032, is actually both a real-life location as well as something created in a studio. The real-life gazebo is near the Eastern entrance to the Hellbrunn Palace. A larger one was rebuilt in Hollywood where most of the scenes were actually shot. As is evident, the scenes in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 have been carefully shot to capture the beauty of the location and to transport us into this enchanting world inhabited by the von Trapp family and Maria. Making the best use of the locations is just one small aspect that has helped this film go down in history as one of the most memorable examples of great cinema.

The film is an adaptation of the 1959 stage musical, composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and a book by Lindsay and Crouse. Based on the 1949 memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria von Trapp, the film is set in Salzburg, Austria and is a fictional retelling of her experiences as governess to seven children, her eventual marriage with their father Captain Georg Von Trapp, and their escape during the Anschluss in 1938. Filming took place from March to September 1964 in Los Angeles and Salzburg. The Sound of Music was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited roadshow theatrical release. Although initial critical response to the film was mixed, it was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office film after four weeks, and the highest-grossing film of 1965. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all-time\u2014surpassing Gone with the Wind\u2014and held that distinction for five years. The film was just as popular throughout the world, breaking previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries. Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years, and two successful re-releases, the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286 million. The Sound of Music received five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Wise's second pair of both awards, the first being from the 1961 film West Side Story. The film also received two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture and Best Actress, the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. In 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) listed The Sound of Music as the fifty-fifth greatest American film of all time, and the fourth-greatest film musical. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg in 1938. Her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern. Mother Abbess sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children\u2014Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children out of drapes that are to be changed. She takes them around Salzburg and the mountains while teaching them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake which concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain attempts to fire Maria. However, he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. The Captain apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay. Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes that he enters them in the upcoming Salzburg Festival, but the Captain disapproves of letting his children sing in public. During a grand party at the villa, where guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional L\u00e4ndler folk dance, he steps in and partners Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy by indirectly convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. However, Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, so she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her purpose in life. When Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. However, the Baroness learns that the Captain's feelings\n\nquestion: Where was 'The Sound of Music' filmed?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Los Angeles and Salzburg", "usage": 1124}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

While the couple is on their honeymoon, Max enters the children into the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. Having learned that Austria has been annexed by the Third Reich, the couple return to their home, where the Captain receives a telegram, ordering him to report to the German Naval base at Bremerhaven to accept a commission in the Kriegsmarine. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and their ideology, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. That night, the von Trapp family attempt to flee to Switzerland, but they are stopped by a group of Brownshirts, led by the Gauleiter Hans Zeller, waiting outside the villa. To cover his family's tracks, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven. Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slips away and seeks shelter at the abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Zeller and his men soon arrive and search the abbey, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When they attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start, as two of the nuns have sabotaged their engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom. The real Maria von Trapp has a brief uncredited cameo as a passerby, alongside her children Rosmarie and Werner von Trapp during \"I Have Confidence\". The Sound of Music story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, published in 1949 to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband Georg in 1947. Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told. In 1956, German producer Wolfgang Liebeneiner purchased the film rights for $9,000 (equivalent to $97,000 in 2022), hired George Hurdalek and Herbert Reinecker to write the screenplay, and Franz Grothe to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional Austrian folk songs. The Trapp Family was released in West Germany on October 9, 1956, and became a major success. Two years later, Liebeneiner directed a sequel, The Trapp Family in America, and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years. Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America. In 1956, Paramount Pictures purchased the United States film rights, intending to produce an English-language version with Audrey Hepburn as Maria. The studio eventually dropped its option, but one of its directors, Vincent J. Donehue, proposed the story as a stage musical for Mary Martin. Producers Richard Halliday and Leland Heyward secured the rights and hired playwrights Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, who had won the Pulitzer Prize for State of the Union. They approached Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II to compose one song for the musical, but the composers felt the two styles\u2014traditional Austrian folk songs and their composition\u2014would not work together. They offered to write a completely new score for the entire production if the producers were willing to wait while they completed work on Flower Drum Song. The producers quickly responded that they would wait as long as necessary. The Sound of Music stage musical opened on November 16, 1959, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York City and ran on Broadway for 1,443 performances, winning six Tony Awards, including Best Musical. In June 1960, Twentieth Century-Fox purchased the film adaptation rights to the stage musical for $1.25 million (equivalent to $12,400,000 in 2022) against ten percent of the gross. In December 1962, 20th Century-Fox president Richard D. Zanuck hired Ernest Lehman to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of the stage musical. Lehman reviewed the original script for the stage musical, rearranged the sequence of songs, and began transforming a work designed for the stage into a film that could use the camera to emphasize action and mood and open the story up to the beautiful locations of Salzburg and the Austrian Alps. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" sequence in the play, for example, was originally a stagnant number; Lehman transformed it into a lively montage showing some of the beautiful sites of Salzburg, as well as showing Maria and the children growing closer over time. Lehman also eliminated two songs, \"How Can Love Survive?\" and \"No Way to Stop It\", sung by the characters of Elsa and Max. In January 1963, he saw the Fox English-d\n\nquestion: Where was 'The Sound of Music' filmed?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Austria and California", "usage": 1131}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material. While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director. Their first choice was Robert Wise, with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of West Side Story, but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, The Sand Pebbles. Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including Stanley Donen, Vincent J. Donehue, George Roy Hill, and Gene Kelly. In January 1963, Lehman invited one of his favorite directors, William Wyler, to travel to New York City with him to see the Broadway musical. After seeing the show, Wyler said he hated it, but after two weeks of Lehman's persuasion, Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film. After hiring musical supervisor Roger Edens, Wyler, Lehman, and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations. In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy-five locations\u2014an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences. During that trip, Lehman began to have reservations about Wyler's commitment to the project and communicated this to Zanuck, who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible. Lehman completed the first draft on September 10, 1963, and sent it to Wyler, who had no suggestions or changes to add. At that time, Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise, whom Lehman still wanted as the director. Later that month, Wyler's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct The Collector. Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film, and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director, ending Wyler's participation. Meanwhile, Wise, whose film The Sand Pebbles had been postponed, read Lehman's first draft, was impressed by what he read, and agreed to direct the film, joining the picture in October 1963, and flew to Salzburg with associate producer Saul Chaplin and members of his production team to scout filming locations, including many that Wyler had identified. When he returned, Wise began working on the script. Wise shared Lehman's vision of the film being centered on the music, and the changes he made were consistent with the writer's approach\u2014mainly reducing the amount of sweetness and sentimentality found in the stage musical. He had reservations about Lehman's opening aerial sequence because West Side Story, whose screenplay Lehman had also written, had used a similar opening sequence, but he was unable to think of a better one and decided to keep Lehman's. Other changes included replacing \"An Ordinary Couple\" with a more romantic number, and a new song for Maria's departure from the abbey\u2014Rodgers provided \"Something Good\" and \"I Have Confidence\", especially for the film. Lehman completed the second draft on December 20, 1963, but additional changes would be made based on input from Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer about the character of the Captain. Plummer especially helped change a character lacking substance into a stronger, more forceful complex figure with a wry sense of humor and a darker edge. Lehman completed his final draft on March 20, 1964. Lehman's first and only choice for Maria was Julie Andrews. When Wise joined the project, he made a list of his choices for the role, which included Andrews as his first choice, Grace Kelly, and Shirley Jones. Wise and Lehman went to Disney Studios to view footage from Mary Poppins, which was not yet released. A few minutes into the film, Wise told Lehman, \"Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this film and grabs her!\" Andrews had some reservations\u2014mainly about the amount of sweetness in the theatrical version\u2014but when she learned that her concerns were shared by Wise and Lehman and what their vision was, she signed a contract with Fox to star in The Sound of Music and one other film for $225,000 (equivalent to $2,120,000 in 2022). Wise had a more difficult time casting the role of the Captain. A number of actors were considered for the part, including Bing Crosby, Yul Brynner, Sean Connery, and Richard Burton. Wise had seen Christopher Plummer on Broadway and wanted him for the role, but the stage actor turned down the offer several times. Wise flew to London to meet with Plummer and explained his concept of the film; the actor accepted after being assured that he could work with Lehman to improve the character. Wise also spent considerable time and effort on casting the secondary characters. For the role of Max Detweiler, Wise initially considered Victor Borge, No\u00ebl Coward, and Hal Holbrook among others before deciding on Richard Haydn. For the character of Baroness Elsa Schraeder\n\nquestion: Where was 'The Sound of Music' filmed?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Salzburg, Austria and California", "usage": 1127}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The casting of the children's characters began in November 1963 and involved over two hundred interviews and auditions throughout the United States and England. Some of the child actors interviewed or tested, who were not selected, included Mia Farrow, Patty Duke, Lesley Ann Warren, Geraldine Chaplin, Shelley Fabares, Teri Garr, Kurt Russell, and The Osmonds. Most of the actors selected had some acting, singing, or dancing experience. Charmian Carr, however, was a model who worked part-time in a doctor's office and had no ambition to pursue a career as an actress. After a friend sent her photo to Wise's office, she was asked to interview. Wise later recalled, \"She was so pretty and had such poise and charm that we liked her immediately.\" The last person to be cast was Daniel Truhitte in the role of Rolfe. Rehearsals for the singing and dance sequences began on February 10, 1964. The husband-and-wife team of Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, who had worked with Andrews on Mary Poppins, worked out the choreography with Saul Chaplin on piano\u2014the arrangements could not be altered under Rodgers and Hammerstein's contract. The stage choreography was not used because it was too restrictive. Breaux and Wood worked out all-new choreography better suited for the film that incorporated many of the Salzburg locations and settings. They even choreographed the newly added puppet dance sequence for \"The Lonely Goatherd\". The choreography for the L\u00e4ndler strictly followed the traditional Austrian folk dance. The musical arranger Irwin Kostal prerecorded the songs with a large orchestra and singers on a stage before the start of filming. In her book, The Sound of Music: The Making of America's Favorite Movie, Julia Antopol Hirsch says that Kostal used seven children and five adults to record the children's voices; the only scene in which the child-actors' singing is heard in the released version of the film is when they sing \"The Sound of Music\" on their own after Maria leaves. Charmian Carr refuted the claim that the voices of the child actors were dubbed in the film and on the soundtrack. Carr contended that all of the children who are in the film sing on the track, but four other children were added to most of the songs to give them a fuller sound; they did not replace them as singers. The voices of some of the adult actors had voice doubles, including those of Peggy Wood and Christopher Plummer. Principal photography began on March 26, 1964, at 20th Century-Fox studios in Los Angeles, where scenes from Maria's bedroom and the abbey cloister and graveyard were filmed. The company then flew to Salzburg, where filming resumed on April 23 at Mondsee Abbey for the wedding scenes. From April 25 through May 22, scenes were filmed at the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, Residence Fountain, and various street locations throughout the Altstadt (Old Town) area of the city. Wise faced opposition from city leaders who did not want him staging scenes with swastika banners. They relented after he threatened instead to include old newsreel footage featuring the banners. On days when it rained, a constant challenge for the company, Wise arranged for scenes to be shot at St. Margarethen Chapel and D\u00fcrer Studios (Reverend Mother's office). From May 23 to June 7, the company worked at Schloss Leopoldskron and an adjacent property called Bertelsmann for scenes representing the lakeside terrace and gardens of the von Trapp villa. From June 9 to 19, scenes were shot at Frohnburg Palace, which represented the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa. Karath could not swim and was in danger during the capsizing boat scene. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" picnic scene in the mountains was filmed above the town of Werfen in the Salzach River valley on June 25 and 27. The opening sequence of Maria on her mountain was filmed from June 28 to July 2 at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg in Bavaria. During filming, Birch trees were added and then removed. The brook she walks through was plastic filled with water which was put there during filming. The final scene of the von Trapp family escaping over the mountains was filmed on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. The cast and crew flew back to Los Angeles and resumed filming at Fox Studios on July 6 for all remaining scenes, including those in the villa dining room, ballroom, terrace, living room, and gazebo. Following the last two scenes shot in the gazebo\u2014for the songs \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Sevent\n\nquestion: Where was 'The Sound of Music' filmed?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Los Angeles and Salzburg", "usage": 1122}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A total of eighty-three scenes were filmed in just over five months. Post-production work began on August 25 with three weeks of dialogue dubbing to correct lines that were ruined by various street noises and rain. In October, Christopher Plummer's singing voice was dubbed by veteran Disney playback singer Bill Lee. The film was then edited by Wise and film editor William Reynolds. Once the film was edited, Irwin Kostal, who orchestrated the musical numbers, underscored the film with background music consisting of variations on Rodgers and Hammerstein's original songs to amplify or add nuances to the visual images. When dubbing, editing, and scoring were complete, Wise arranged for two sneak-preview showings\u2014the first one held in Minneapolis on Friday, January 15, 1965 at the Mann Theater, and the second one held the following night in Tulsa. Despite the \"sensational\" responses from the preview audiences, Wise made a few final editing changes before completing the film. According to the original print information for the film, the running time for the theatrical release version was 174 minutes. The film was still in release when the Motion Picture Association of America's film ratings system was implemented in 1968, and was subsequently given a \"G\" rating (\"general audiences\") in 1969. The Sound of Music was filmed in Todd-AO by Ted McCord and produced with DeLuxe Color processing. Aerial footage was photographed with an MCS-70 camera. The sound was recorded on a 70 mm six-track using a Westrex recording system. The sets used for the film were based on the storyboards of sketch artist Maurice Zuberano, who accompanied Wise to Austria to scout filming locations in November 1963. Wise met with the artist over ten weeks and explained his objective for each scene\u2014the feeling he wanted to convey and the visual images he wanted to use. When Zuberano was finished, he provided Wise with a complete set of storyboards that illustrated each scene and set\u2014storyboards the director used as guidance during filming. Zuberano's storyboards and location photos were also used by art director Boris Leven to design and construct all of the original interior sets at Fox studios, as well as some external sets in Salzburg. The von Trapp villa, for example, was actually filmed in several locations: the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa were filmed at Frohnburg Palace, the lakeside terrace and gardens was a set constructed on a property adjacent to Schloss Leopoldskron called Bertelsmann, and the interior was a constructed set at Fox Studios. The gazebo scenes for \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" were filmed on a larger reconstructed set at Fox studios, while some shots of the original gazebo were filmed on the grounds at Schloss Leopoldskron in Salzburg. Most of the soundtrack to The Sound of Music was written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and arranged and conducted by Irwin Kostal, who also adapted the instrumental underscore passages. Both the lyrics and music for two new songs were written by Rodgers, as Hammerstein died in 1960. The soundtrack album was released by RCA Victor in 1965 and is one of the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 20 million copies worldwide. The album reached the number one position on the Billboard 200 that year in the United States. It remained in the top ten for 109 weeks, from May 1, 1965, to July 16, 1967, and remained on the Billboard 200 chart for 238 weeks. The album was the best-selling album in the United Kingdom in 1965, 1966, and 1968 and the second best-selling of the entire decade, spending a total of 70 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It also stayed 73 weeks on the Norwegian charts, becoming the seventh best-charting album of all time in that country. In 2015, Billboard named the album the second greatest album of all time. The album has been reissued several times, including anniversary editions with additional tracks in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Wise hired Mike Kaplan to direct the publicity campaign for the film. After reading the script, Kaplan decided on the ad line \"The Happiest Sound in All the World\", which would appear on promotional material and artwork. Kaplan also brought in outside agencies to work with the studio's advertising department to develop the promotional artwork, eventually selecting a painting by Howard Terpning of Andrews on an alpine meadow with her carpetbag and guitar case in hand with the children and Plummer in the background. In February 1964, Kaplan began placing ads in the trade papers Daily Variety, Weekly Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter to attract future exhibitor interest in the project. The studio intended the film to have an initial roadshow theatrical release in select large cities in theaters that could accommodate the 70-mm screenings and six-track stereophonic sound.

Kaplan identified forty key cities that would likely be included in the roadshow release and developed a promotional strategy targeting the major newspapers of those cities. During the Salzburg production phase, 20th Century-Fox organized press junkets for American journalists to interview Wise and his team and the cast members. \"No one is comfortable with an excess of hearts and flowers, but there is no valid reason for hiding honest emotion. This has always been a major element in the theatre, and it's my conviction that anyone who can't, on occasion, be sentimental about children, home or nature is sadly maladjusted.\" Richard Rodgers The film had its opening premiere on March 2, 1965, at the Rivoli Theater in New York City. Initial reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's \"romantic nonsense and sentiment\", the children's \"artificial roles\", and Robert Wise's \"cosy-cum-corny\" direction. Judith Crist, in a biting review in the New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as \"icky sticky\" and designed for \"the five to seven set and their mommies\". In her review for McCall's magazine, Pauline Kael called the film \"the sugar-coated lie people seem to want to eat\", and that audiences have \"turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs.\" Wise later recalled, \"The East Coast, intellectual papers and magazines destroyed us, but the local papers and the trades gave us great reviews\". Indeed, reviewers such as Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \"three hours of visual and vocal brilliance\", and Variety called it \"a warmly-pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast\". The \"wildly mixed film reviews\" reflected the critical response to the stage musical, according to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical. After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10, The Sound of Music opened in 131 theaters in the United States, including a limited number of roadshow events. After four weeks, the film became the number one box office movie in the country and held that position for thirty out of the next forty-three weeks in 1965. The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years. A few months after its United States release, The Sound of Music opened in 261 theaters in other countries, the first American movie to be completely dubbed in a foreign language, both dialogue, and music. The German, French, Italian, and Spanish versions were completely dubbed, the Japanese version had Japanese dialogue with English songs, and other versions were released with foreign subtitles. The film was a popular success in every country it opened, except the two countries where the story originated, Austria and Germany. In these two countries, the film had to compete with the much-loved Die Trapp-Familie (1956), which provided the original inspiration for the Broadway musical, and its sequel Die Trapp-Familie in Amerika (1958); both films are still widely popular in German-speaking Europe and considered the authoritative von Trapp story. Austrians took exception to the liberties taken by the filmmakers with regard to the costumes, which did not reflect the traditional style and the replacement of traditional Austrian folk songs with Broadway show tunes. The film's Nazi theme was especially unpopular in Germany, where the Munich branch manager for 20th Century-Fox approved the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act of the film following the wedding sequence\u2014the scenes showing Salzburg following the Anschluss. Robert Wise and the studio intervened, the original film was restored, and the branch manager was fired. The Sound of Music holds an 84% \"Certified Fresh\" score on Rotten Tomatoes based on seventy-four reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's consensus states: \"Unapologetically sweet and maybe even a little corny, The Sound of Music will win over all but the most cynical filmgoers with its classic songs and irresistible warmth.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on eleven critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The Sound of Music is one of the most commercially successful films of all time. Four weeks after its theatrical release, it became the number one box office movie in the United States, from revenue generated by twenty-five theaters, each screening only ten roadshow performances per week. It held the number one position for thirty of the next forty-three weeks, and ended up the highest-grossing film of 1965. One contributing factor in the film's early commercial success was the repeat business of many filmgoers. In some cities in the United States, the number of tickets sold exceeded the total population.

Worldwide, The Sound of Music broke previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries, including the United Kingdom, where it played for a record-breaking three years at the Dominion Theatre in London and earned \u00a34 million in rentals and grossed \u00a36 million\u2014more than twice as much as any other film had taken in. It was also a major success in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, where it played for as long as two years at some theaters. It was not a universal success, however, with the film only enjoying modest success in France and it was a flop in Germany. It also initially performed poorly in Italy, but a re-release after the Oscars brought better results. It was number one at the US box office for a further 11 weeks in 1966, for a total of 41 weeks at number one. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all time, with over $67.5 million in worldwide rentals ($125 million in gross receipts), surpassing Gone with the Wind, which held that distinction for twenty-four years. It was still in the top ten at the US box office in its 100th week of release. The Sound of Music completed its initial four-and-a-half year theatrical release run in the United States on Labor Day 1969, the longest initial run for a film in the US, having earned $68,313,000 in rentals in the United States and Canada. It played for 142 weeks at the Eglinton Theatre in Toronto. It was the first film to gross over $100 million. By December 1970, it had earned $121.5 million in worldwide rentals, which was over four times higher than the film's estimated break-even point of $29.5 million in rentals. The film was re-released in 1973, and increased its North American rentals to $78.4 million. By the end of the 1970s, it was ranked seventh in all-time North American rentals, having earned $79 million. The film's re-release in 1990 increased the total North American admissions to 142,415,400\u2014the third-highest number of tickets sold behind Gone with the Wind and Star Wars\u2014and about 283.3 million admissions worldwide. The Sound of Music eventually earned a total domestic gross of $163,214,076 and a total worldwide gross of $286,214,076. Adjusted for inflation, the film earned about $2.366 billion at 2014 prices\u2014placing it among the top ten highest-grossing films of all time. The Sound of Music has been included in numerous top film lists from the American Film Institute. The first American television transmission of The Sound of Music was on February 29, 1976, on ABC, which paid $15 million (equivalent to $77,140,351 in 2022) for a one-time only broadcast that became one of the top 20 rated films shown on television to that point with a Nielsen rating of 33.6 and an audience share of 49%. The movie was not shown again until NBC acquired the broadcast rights in June 1977 for $21.5 million for 20 showings over 22 years and telecast the film on February 11, 1979. NBC continued to air the film annually for twenty years. During most of its run on NBC, the film was heavily edited to fit a three-hour time slot\u2014approximately 140 minutes without commercials, which inevitably cut 30 minutes out of the original film. The film aired in its uncut form (minus the entr'acte) on April 9, 1995, on NBC. Julie Andrews hosted the four-hour telecast which presented the musical numbers in a letterboxed format. As the film's home video availability cut into its television ratings, NBC let their contract lapse in 2001. That year, the film was broadcast one time on the Fox network, in its heavily edited 140-minute version. Since 2002, the film has aired on ABC on a Sunday night prior to Christmas and has been broadcast on its sister cable network, Freeform, periodically around Easter and other holidays. Most of its more recent runs have been the full version in a four-hour time slot, complete with the entr'acte. ABC first broadcast a high-definition version on December 28, 2008. On December 22, 2013, the annual broadcast had its highest ratings since 2007; the increase in ratings were credited to NBC's broadcast of The Sound of Music Live!\u2014a live television adaptation of the original musical which aired earlier that month. In the United Kingdom, the film rights were acquired by the BBC, who paid a corporation record $4.1 million, and it was first aired on BBC One on 25 December 1978 and, as of December 2016, fifteen times since, mostly around Christmas time.

The film was also intended to be part of the BBC's programming during the outbreak of nuclear war. The film has been released on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD numerous times. The first DVD version was released on August 29, 2000, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the film's release. The film is often included in box sets with other Rodgers & Hammerstein film adaptations. A 40th anniversary DVD, with \"making of\" documentaries and special features, was released on November 15, 2005. The film made its debut issue on Blu-ray Disc on November 2, 2010, for its 45th anniversary. For the Blu-ray release, the original 70 mm negatives were rescanned at 8K resolution, then restored and remastered at 4K resolution for the transfer to Blu-ray, giving the most detailed copy of the film seen thus far. On March 10, 2015, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released The Sound of Music 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition\u2014a five-disc set featuring thirteen hours of bonus features, including a new documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg. A March 2015 episode of ABC's 20/20 entitled The Untold Story of the Sound of Music featured a preview of the documentary and interviews by Diane Sawyer. In part to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, the film was made available on the Disney+ streaming service upon its debut on November 12, 2019. The Sound of Music film adaptation, like the stage musical, presents a history of the von Trapp family (a.k.a. the Trapp Family) that is not completely accurate. The musical was based on the West German film The Trapp Family (1956) rather than Maria von Trapp's 1949 memoirs, as director Vincent J. Donehue had seen the film and decided that it would make a good vehicle for Mary Martin. The musical followed the film's plot so closely that the New York Times review of the West German film noticed that it \"strongly suggests 'The Sound of Music,' often scene by scene.\" The West German screenwriters made several significant changes to the family's story that were kept in the musical. Maria had been hired to teach just one child, but the 1956 film made her governess to all seven children. The 1965 film adaptation was influenced by other musicals of its era, such as Mary Poppins, the Rodgers and Hammerstein television production of Cinderella, and the stage production of Lerner and Loewe's Camelot (coincidentally all starring Julie Andrews). Screenwriter Ernest Lehman was inspired by the opening of West Side Story and saw the musical as \"a fairy tale that's almost real\". The film incorporated many \"fairy tale\" tropes which included the idyllic imagery (placed in the hills of Salzburg), the European villas, and the cross-class Cinderella-like romance between Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As Maria walks down the aisle to be married, the pageantry is explicitly both Guinevere and Cinderella. In keeping with this tone the filmmakers used artistic license to convey the essence and meaning of their story. Georg Ludwig von Trapp was indeed an anti-Nazi opposed to the Anschluss, and lived with his family in a villa in a district of Salzburg called Aigen. Their lifestyle depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living. The actual family villa, located at Traunstra\u00dfe 34, Aigen 5026, was large and comfortable but not nearly as grand as the mansion depicted in the film. The house was also not their ancestral home, as depicted in the film. The family had previously lived in homes in Zell Am See and Klosterneuburg after being forced to abandon their actual ancestral home in Pola following World War I. Georg moved the family to the Salzburg villa shortly after the death of his first wife, Agathe Whitehead, in 1922. Georg is referred to as \"Captain\" in the film, but he held a noble title of \"Ritter\" (hereditary knight), which had higher social status than a naval officer. Although Austrian nobility was legally abolished in 1919 and the nobiliary particle von was proscribed, both continued to be widely used unofficially as a matter of social courtesy. Georg was offered a position in the German Kriegsmarine; Nazi Germany was looking to expand its fleet of U-boats, and Corvette Captain von Trapp was the most successful Austro-Hungarian submarine commander of World War I, having sunk 11 Allied merchant ships totaling 47,653 GRT and two Allied warships displacing a total of 12,641 tons. With his family in desperate financial straits, he seriously considered the offer before deciding he could not serve a Nazi regime. In the film, Georg is depicted initially as a humorless, emotionally distant father. In reality, third child Maria Franziska von Trapp (\n\nquestion: Where was 'The Sound of Music' filmed?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Austria and California.", "usage": 1144}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She has a different recollection of her stepmother, Maria Augusta Kutschera, whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage. In a 2003 interview, Maria remembered, \" had a terrible temper... and from one moment to the next, you didn't know what hit her. We were not used to this. But we took it like a thunderstorm that would pass, because the next minute she could be very nice.\" Maria Kutschera had indeed been a novice at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and had been hired by the von Trapp family. However, she was hired only to be a tutor to young Maria Franziska, who had come down with scarlet fever and needed her lessons at home, not to be a governess for all of the children. Maria and Georg married for practical reasons, rather than love and affection for each other. Georg needed a mother for his children, and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey. \"I really and truly was not in love,\" Maria wrote in her memoir, \"I liked him but didn't love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children. I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after.\" They were married in 1927, not in 1938 as depicted in the film, and the couple had been married for over a decade by the time of the Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time. Maria and Georg enjoyed a happy marriage. The von Trapp family lost most of its wealth during the worldwide depression of the early 1930s, when the Austrian national bank folded. In order to survive, the family dismissed the servants and began taking in boarders. They also started singing onstage to earn money, a fact that caused the proud Georg much embarrassment. In the film, the von Trapp family hike over the Alps from Austria to Switzerland to escape the Nazis, which would not have been possible; Salzburg is over two hundred miles from Switzerland. The von Trapp villa, however, was only a few kilometers from the Austria\u2013Germany border, and the final scene shows the family hiking on the Obersalzberg near the German town of Berchtesgaden, within sight of Adolf Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus Eagle's Nest retreat. In reality, the family simply walked to the local train station and boarded a train to Italy. The Trapps were entitled to Italian citizenship since Georg had been born in Zadar, Dalmatia, Austria-Hungary, which had been annexed by Italy after World War I. They were able to emigrate to the United States via the United Kingdom on their Italian passports. The fictional character Max Detweiler, who acted as the scheming family music director in the film, is based on the von Trapps' family priest, the Reverend Franz Wasner, who was their musical director for over twenty years and, unlike Max, accompanied them when they left Austria. The character of Friedrich, the second oldest child in the film version, was based on Rupert, the oldest of the real von Trapp children. Liesl, the oldest child in the film, was based on Agathe von Trapp, the second oldest in the real family. The names and ages of the children were changed, in part because the third child, who would be portrayed as \"Louisa\", was also named Maria, and producers thought that it would be confusing to have two characters called Maria in the film. The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers. Robert Wise met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to Richard Zanuck, that he was not making a \"documentary or realistic movie\" about her family, and that he would make the film with \"complete dramatic freedom\" in order to produce a \"fine and moving film\", one they could all be proud of. Although The Sound of Music is set in Salzburg, it was largely ignored in Austria upon release. The film adaptation was a blockbuster worldwide, but it ran for only three days in Salzburg movie theaters, with locals showing \"disdain\" for a film that \"wasn't authentic.\" In 1966, American Express created the first Sound of Music guided tour in Salzburg. Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been the leading Sound of Music bus tour company in the city, taking approximately 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region. Although the Salzburg tourism industry took advantage of the attention from foreign tourists, residents of the city were apathetic\n\nquestion: Where was 'The Sound of Music' filmed?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Austria", "usage": 1125}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A German translation of the musical was performed on the national stage for the first time in 2005 at the Vienna Volksoper, receiving negative reviews from Austrian critics, who called it \"boring\" and referred to \"Edelweiss\" as \"an insult to Austrian musical creation.\" The musical finally premiered in Salzburg in 2011 at the Salzburger Landestheater, but Maria was played in the Salzburg premiere by a Dutch actress who \"grew up with the songs.\" However, most performances in Vienna and Salzburg were sold out, and the musical is now in both companies' repertoire. A Sing-along Sound of Music revival screening was first shown at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 1999, leading to a successful run at the Prince Charles Cinema which is ongoing as of 2018. During the screenings, audience members are often dressed as nuns and von Trapp children and are encouraged to sing along to lyrics superimposed on the screen. In July 2000, Sing-along Sound of Music shows opened in Boston, Massachusetts, and Austin, Texas. Some audience members dressed up as cast members and interacted with the action shown on the screen. The film began a successful run at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City in September 2000, with the opening attended by cast members Charmian Carr (Liesl), Daniel Truhitte (Rolfe), and Kym Karath (Gretl). Sing-along Sound of Music screenings have since become an international phenomenon. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The Academy Film Archive preserved The Sound of Music in 2003.

Directed by the multiple Academy Award winning luminary Robert Wise (who also directed \u2018West Side Story\u2019), the film boasted the talents of Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and was phenomenal commercial success, managing to rake in three hundred million dollars way back in the 1960s. Today, the legacy of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is irreproachable, having five Academy Awards to its name and enduring renown that continues to make the film relevant even today. Based on the 1959 stage musical of the same name (which in turn is based on the memoir \u201cThe Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u201d by Maria von Trapp), \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 follows the von Trapp family and their new governess Maria. Maria is a struggling nun who is assigned the job of taking care of the exceedingly mischievous seven von Trapp children. Their father, Georg von Trapp, is a retired naval captain who runs his household with military discipline after the death of his wife. While initially cold and hostile towards Maria, the von Trapp children eventually fall for her kind demeanor and melodious personality. Even the stoic captain finds himself falling for Maria affable charms but their idyllic lifestyle is threatened when the Nazis start to take over their country. If you were wondering what were \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 filming locations, read on. The backdrop for much of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is the charming pre World War II town of Salzburg in Austria during the 1930s. The scenery shows off distant snow-capped mountain peaks, verdant hilltops perfect for breaking into a spontaneous melody, and cultured medieval buildings that occupy the imagination. While it is possible to recreate these distinctive features of the region on a set as well, such a facsimile is unlikely to be nearly as authentic as the real thing. This is especially true of the 1960s when CGI wasn\u2019t really an option for filmmakers. Keeping this in mind, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 was largely filmed on location in Austria itself, specifically in the city of Salzburg. Limited filming for scenes was also done in studio in California, as well as a few scenes in Bavaria, Germany. Principal filming commenced in late March 1964 and concluded later that year in September.

The production started out with the filming of Maria\u2019s bedroom scenes as well as the nun Abbey cloister. Sketch artist Maurice Zuberano accompanied director Robert Wise to scout for locations in Austria. After a ten week period, Zuberano prepared a set of storyboards and location photos to art director Boris Leven, who designed and constructed the interior sets at Fox Studios in painstaking detail. It is on these sets that parts of the gazebo scenes in the wildly popular songs \u201cSomething Good\u201d and \u201cSixteen Going on Seventeen\u201d were filmed. The 20th century Fox Studios have served as the filming location for many world renowned films and TV shows including \u2018Modern Family\u2019, \u2018Fight Club\u2019, \u2018Edward Scissorhands\u2019, and \u2018Arrested Development\u2019. The majority of the filming for \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 took place in and around the delightful city of Salzburg in Austria. The wedding scenes were filmed at the Benedictine monastery of Mondsee Abbey in Upper Austria, with on location filming also done at Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and the Altstadt Old Town area of Salzburg.

Start Traveling. Austria \u2022 See & Do One of the most famous musical films, The Sound of Music, which was filmed in 1965 is still loved by many today. Each year hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Salzburg, Austria to walk in the footsteps of the legendary Von Trapp family. If you are a fan of the movie and wondering where the Sound of Music was filmed, you\u2019ve come to the right place. From the gazebo where Liesl sings \u201c16 going on 17\u201d to the Abbey where Maria lived and got married, here are all the must-visit Sound of Music filming locations. Recommendation: Relive the scenes of some of the most popular Sound of Music locations in Salzburg including Leopoldskron Palace, Nonnberg Abbey, and Mirabell Gardens on a guided Sound of Music tour. With an English speaking guide, and songs from the soundtrack playing throughout the tour, this Original Sound of Music tour from Salzburg won\u2019t disappoint! Marvel at the breathtaking locations for the Sound of Music and sing through the streets of Salzburg. Founded in 714 A.D., Nonnberg Abbey (German: Stift Nonnberg) is the oldest female convent north of the Alps and is where the real-life Maria became a novice nun and got married to Georg von Trapp. Nonnberg is where four scenes from the movie were filmed: the scene of the nuns singing \u201cMaria\u201d in the courtyard, Maria leaving the abbey, the kids visiting her at the abbey, and the Nazi\u2019s hunting the Von Trapps. Visitors will notice the interior of the Abbey is different from the movie, as filming inside the convent was not allowed, so the interior scenes were shot in a Hollywood studio. A highlight of this Sound of Music location in Salzburg is hearing the resident nuns Gregorian chants in Latin at 6:45 in the morning inside the beautiful Gothic abbey. The small yet beautiful flower filled St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery (German: Petersfriedhof) was the inspiration for the cemetery rebuilt on set for the scene towards the end of the movie in which the Von Trapps hide from the Nazis behind tombs. Beside being the resting place of Mozart\u2019s sister, Nannerl, this is also the resting place of Max Detweiler, \u201cUncle Max\u201d from the movie. This unique cemetery is one of the oldest (and most beautiful) cemeteries in the world and is Salzburg\u2019s oldest Christian cemetery. The catacombs carved out of the rocks of M\u00f6nchsberg provide a stunning view over the beautiful cemetery and should be visited during your Sound of Music tour in Salzburg. This baroque style garden, which was built in 1606 by the archbishop Wolf Dietrich for his mistress is a beautifully landscaped garden filled with gorgeous flowers, marble statues, fountains, and ample opportunities to reenact scenes from the movies. The iconic song, \u201cDo Re, Mi\u201d was partially shot here. While visiting Mirabell gardens, you\u2019ll relive the scene of Maria and the Von Trapp kids dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, jumping up and down the steps, as well as running through the hedge maze tunnel, all the while admiring the breathtaking view of Hohensalzburg Fortress in the distance. This film location spot, which can be visited for free, should not be missed. Situated in the center of Salzburg old town is Residence Square (German: Residenzplatz), which is home to the largest (45 feet tall) baroque fountain outside of Italy. It is in this square while singing \u201cI Have Confidence in Me\u201d, that Maria happily splashes water in the fountain, The Nazi soliders also march through the square later in the movie and hang their flag over the entrance of the old Residence Palace. Built in the 17th century to wash the horses of the prince-archbishop, the Horse Pond (German: Pferdeschwemme) was briefly featured in the movie as a backdrop to Maria and the kids singing \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d while dancing in their clothes made from curtains. In addition to being featured in the musical, the Horse Pond is well worth a visit in its own right. It is situation below the cliff side of M\u00f6nchsberg, and the bright fresco behind the horse pond makes for a gorgeous picture to add to your Sound of Music tour album. Carved into the M\u00f6nchsberg, the Rock Riding School (German: Felsenreitschule) was initially built to be a cathedral, but was later repurposed by the archbishop into a riding school where tournaments were held.

Fans will recognize this Sound of Music filming location from the scene where the Captain sings \u201cEdelweiss\u201d and his family joins him on stage to sing \u201cSo Long, Farewell\u201d. Frohnburg Palace played an important role in the Sound of Music as it was one of the two filming locations for the Von Trapp Villa. Once a private residence, the palace is now a Music Academy, the facade and large iron gate is where Maria first set her eyes on the Von Trapp family home towards the end of the song \u201cI Have Confidence\u201d. The Palace was also featured in the movie during the scenes in which the Captain rips the Nazi flag from above the doorway and during the family\u2019s attempt to escape from the Nazis by pushing their car silently out of the gate. Just outside the city center is Hellbrunn Palace, home to the Sound of Music gazebo. It was here that the most romantic scenes of the Sound of Music was captured; when Liesl gets her first kiss while singing \u201c16 going on 17.\u201d It is also where the Captain and Maria fall deeper in love with each other while singing \u201cSomething Good\u201d. Though visitors cannot go into the gazebo, they can dance, sing, and take as many pictures as they please around it. Make your visit to Hellbrunn even more exciting by taking a tour of the Trick Fountains at Hellbrunn Palace. The hour long tour takes you through grottoes, ponds, and walkways filled with trick fountains. Your ticket also lets you explore the inside of the palace. This is one of the best things to do in Salzburg and will be a memorable experience especially for the kids. Leopoldskron Palace is one of the most important filming location for the Sound of Music as the majestic palace and perfect lake view backdrop served as the primary filming location for all of the lake terrace scenes of the Von Trapp family home. This includes the scenes in which Maria and the kids fall off the boat into the lake, and when the Captain and Uncle Max are drinking pink lemonade on the terrace. Though the interior of the mansion was never filmed in the movie, the palace\u2019s gold Venetian ballroom and foyer were rebuilt in Hollywood for the interior scenes. Today the palace is a boutique hotel. Staying overnight is the only way to visit the film location up close and to get a peek into the Venetian ballroom. Staying here is the ultimate Sound of Music experience as you get to live in the home of the Von Trapp family in the film. You can book your stay at Leopoldskron Palace here. If you choose not to stay at the hotel, you can still view the Palace at a distance from the west side of the lake. Though not a filming location, the Von Trapp Villa is where the real Von Trapp family lived for 15 years. They managed to get onto a train at the nearby station to escape the Nazis one day before the Austrian borders were closed. Today the Von Trapp Villa operates as a hotel and an educational Sound of Music museum of the real Von Trapp family as well as behind the scenes information about the filming of the movie. Not far from Leopoldskron Palace, a visit to the Von Trapp Villa would give fans a true insight on the life of the legendary Von Trapp family that we have come to love. Fans can either book a stay at the Villa or simply visit on a guided tour which takes place every day and lasts about 45 minutes. Mt. Untersberg is depicted twice in the Sound of Music, once during the opening scene in which Maria is singing the \u201cSound of Music\u201d and again when the family is escaping over the mountain to Switzerland while singing \u201cClimb Every Mountain\u201d. Fans can easily access Mount Untersberg from Salzburg via bus and get to the top via cable car. More adventurous travelers can hike 2 hours to the top. At 1,853 meters above the Salzburg basin, Mt. Untersberg offers breaktaking views over the region and is worth the day trip from Salzburg. Less than an hour bus drive from Salzburg is the picturesque lakeside town Mondsee. There you can visit the beautiful Collegiate Church of St. Michael where Maria and Georg von Trapp got married in the movie. This is a must-see for any Sound of Music fan. Make a full-day trip out of the location and stroll through the town, take a refreshing dip in the lake, hike up the nearby forest, and eat delicious seafood along the lake. In the opening scene of the movie you get a gorgeous aerial view of the village of St. Gilgen and the popular lake, Wolfgangsee. The village and lake can easily be reached by train.

Make your trip to Werfen a full day adventure by visiting both the Hohenwerfen Fortress and the largest ice cave in the world, Eisriesenwelt. Both sights will be a welcome addition to your Salzburg itinerary. Situated just across the German border, atop the magnificent Rossfeld mountain, is the Rossfeld Panoramic Road which was used in the movie to show the safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain. The private road, Rossfeld Panoramic Road is the only filming location that\u2019s difficult to get to without a car. If you don\u2019t have a car, it is recommended to visit the nearby Untersberg Mountain to get just as spectacular views with easier accessibility. Well there you have it, the top must-visit Sound of Music filming location in and around Salzburg. All locations can be visited on your own, but if you don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle or you have limited time, consider taking a guided Sound of Music tour from Salzburg or Vienna. And to make your Sound of Music trip even more memorable, spend a night or two at the home of the Von Trapp family in the film; Hotel Schloss Leopoldskron, or in the home of the real Von Trapp family at Villa Trapp. Either one will take your trip from amazing to extraordinary.

I\u2019ve visited Salzburg 5 times, and I can\u2019t wait to go back again. But, there are a few errors on this page that need to be clarified and/or corrected. First \u2013 #7 Frohnburg Palace \u2013 the writer of this article is correct \u2013 it WAS used as the von Trapp home in the film. However, what we see in the film as the FRONT of the von Trapp home is actually the BACK of Frohnburg! The FRONT of Frohnburg was used as the BACK of the von Trapp home in the film! The back of the home is seen when Rolf comes to deliver a telegram and the Captain takes it abruptly and tells him to leave. You see it also when the pink lemonade is served. Now, to make this even more complicated, the back of the film home looking toward the lake: the canoe flipping, the Baroness and the Captain strolling by the lake, Leisl running out to meet Rolf, Maria\u2019s return when she comes back from the Abbey, etc., is located to the left of Schloss Leopoldskron. I\u2019ll write more about this below. #8 \u2013 Hellbrun Palace (the gazebo) \u2013 correction \u2013 NONE of the gazebo scenes (\u201c16 Going on 17\u201d and \u201cSomething Good\u201d) were shot anywhere near the gazebo. It was a set in Hollywood. The only time we see the gazebo that is at Hellbrun is when the Captain and the Baroness take their stroll by the lake (just before the canoe flipping). It can be seen briefly in the background during their stroll. #9 \u2013 Leopoldskron Palace \u2013 was NOT used at ALL at any time during the filming!! The production company DID want to film the lake scenes there, but the officials of the Palace at that time wanted too much money. They did, however, offer the company the use of the \u201cside lawn\u201d. If you look at the photo of the Palace on this page, the side lawn is not seen, but it is to the left of the photo\u2019s edge. The \u201cOfficial Sound of Music Tour\u201d guides will show you the Schloss and point out the original horse-headed statues and lake gate and tell you that is where those scenes were filmed. WRONG!!! The \u201clake-gate\u201d and the horse-headed fish statues, were recreated by 20th Century-Fox and erected on the \u201cside lawn\u201d where the Meierhof is now located. The Meierhof used to be the administrative offices for the Palace, but it\n\nquestion: What scenes were filmed at Nonnberg Abbey?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Noans", "usage": 1053}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If one enters the main gate for the Schloss, the Schloss is to the left and the Meierhof is to the right. Walking straight from the gate to the lake one will see the pedestals for the horse-headed statues are still there. As was stated by the writer, the Venetian Room is in the Schloss and was used as the inspiration for the ballroom in the film. #11 \u2013 Mount Untersberg \u2013 clarification \u2013 the mount is seen several times in the background of several scenes, but NO SCENES were filmed ON it. #15 \u2013 Rossfeld Mountain \u2013 clarification \u2013 again, \u201cthe safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain\u201d is inaccurate. That \u201cescape\u201d scene was filmed just off the Rossfeld Panoramastrasse. There is a roadside cafe/restaurant on the Panoramastrasse called the Ahornkaser (they serve the best Apple Strudel you\u2019ll ever have). Standing in front of the Ahornkaser, there is a path on the right side of the building. Take that path about 400 feet and look up to your right. At the top of the hill is the exact spot where the von Trapps cross the mountain to freedom as \u201cClimb Ev\u2019ry Mountain\u201d is sung. At the end of that scene, with that open vista lying before them, you can see the Untersberg in the distance. I hope this helps/informs anyone planning on making a visit. Negar Modgeddi says 1 month ago I LOVE your notations about the actual places and your very thoughtful corrections! Melanie says 6 months ago Thank you for this great information! Do you know which field Maria was walking in during the opening scene? I know it was Untersberg Mountain in the background, but I can\u2019t find any information on the field she was frolicking through to get that sweeping view. Any pointers you can offer would be most appreciated! Ben says 6 months ago The opening scene was filmed on Mehlweg meadow which is not open to the public.

The opening aerial shots are Salzburg\u2019s glorious Lake District, the Salzkammergut. The castles you can see are Kloster H\u00f6glw\u00f6rth, an old monastery on a peninsula in H\u00f6glw\u00f6rther See; and Schloss Anif, off E55 a few miles south of Salzburg. The mountain, atop which Maria (Julie Andrews) makes her first twirling appearance, is Mehlweg, near the Bavarian village of Markt Schellenberg, about six miles from Salzburg. Don\u2019t be too disappointed \u2013 the birch trees and the babbling brook were added for the movie. Convent interiors were recreated in the studio, but the exterior really is Maria\u2019s abbey. It\u2019s Nonnberg Abbey, Nonnberg Gasse, where you can visit the courtyard and peek inside the chapel (which looks nothing like the interior recreated back in Hollywood). The film cheats a little with the exterior, too. As you\u2019ll find if you visit, the real Nonnberg Abbey doesn\u2019t look out over the picturesque old town of Salzburg, but to the nondescript southern suburbs. The reverse shot, of Maria leaving the abbey, filmed way across the city on the Humboldt Terrace (seen later in the Do Re Mi number), in front of the Museum of Modern Art, which since 2002 has stood atop M\u00f6nchsberg Cliffs on the site of the old Cafe Winkler. As Maria leaves to take up her post with the Von Trapp family, I Have Confidence in Me was filmed in Salzburg\u2019s Old Town, in the Residenzplatz, where you\u2019ll see the Domplatz arches, through which Maria enters, and the Residenz Fountain, in which she splashes. The \u2018Villa Von Trapp\u2019 is a combination of two different Salzburg locations. The tree-shaded lane, where Maria alights from the bus, is Hellbrunner Allee, running south from the old town. Here you\u2019ll recognise Schloss Frohnburg, a 17th century country house, now the Mozarteum Music Academy, which was used for the intimidating gates and front entrance of the villa which Maria nervously approaches. The lakeside terrace, though, was filmed at Schloss Leopoldskron, a rococo castle on Leopoldskroner Teich, a small artificial lake on the southwest of the town. You can view Leopoldskron across the lake from K\u00f6nig Ludwig Strasse, but it's now \u2013 hurrah! \u2013 a hotel. Leopoldskron's extravagantly gilt Venetian Room was replicated in the studio in Hollywood. Incidentally, the famous gazebo originally stood on the palace's grounds, when it was a private villa, but was moved to a more accessible location. The real Villa Trapp, by the way, is in Aigen, a suburb just to the southeast of the Old Town of Salzburg. Since 2008, it\u2019s been open as a hotel, Villa Trapp, Traunstra\u00dfe 34, 5026 Salzburg. There\u2019s a rail service to Bahnhof Aigen. The little footbridge over which the von Trapps skip at the beginning of the My Favourite Things montage of Salzburg is Mozart Steg, north of Mozart Platz. They quickly move on to Domplatz, in front of Salzburger Dom (Salzburg Cathedral); Kapitelschwemme, the Baroque horse pond once used for watering and cleaning horses, in Herbert von Karajan Platz; and the market on Kajetanerplatz, just north of Nonnberg Abbey, where Maria demonstrates her tomato juggling skills. They finally head off for a picnic in the meadow above the village of Werfen, 25 miles south of Salzburg in the Salzach River valley (where you can also visit the castle from wartime action movie Where Eagles Dare). Do-Re-Mi begins at the picnic, returning to Salzburg atop the Monchsberg Cliffs, on Humboldt Terrace which you can reach from the Monchsberg elevator in Anton Neumayrplatz, at the end of the Gstattengasse shopping street, and continuing with a carriage ride south from St Erhard Kirche, the Parish Church of St Erhard, along Nonntaler Hauptstra\u00dfe,\n\nquestion: What scenes were filmed at Nonnberg Abbey?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1038}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The number climaxes at Mirabell Gardens, on Schwarzstrasse, over the Salzach River behind Schloss Mirabell, where you\u2019ll find the fountains, statues and, famously, the flight of steps on which the children hop. The Von Trapp gazebo, used for Sixteen Going On Seventeen, once stood in the grounds of Leopoldskron, but constant trespassing resulted in it being moved and reconstructed in the ornamental gardens of Schloss Hellbrunn, Morzger Strasse, toward the south of Salzburg. And another cheat. It was recreated, slightly larger, back at 20th Century-Fox in Hollywood for the interior shots. Maria\u2019s wedding, which took place in Nonnberg Abbey, was filmed in the baroque, twin-towered St Michael\u2019s Church, Wredeplatz, in Mondsee, about 15 miles east of Salzburg on the E55/E60. The Anschluss scene, Austria\u2019s enforced unity with Nazi Germany, was staged back in the centre of Salzburg itself in Residenzplatz. The music festival, at which the von Trapp family perform their disappearing act, is at the Felsenreitschule (\u2018Rock Riding School\u2019), Hofstallgasse 1, a 1400-seat theatre built in what was a rock quarry for Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun in 1693, and used as the archbishop's riding school. It\u2019s one of the sites of the Salzburg Festival. Despite what some overenthusiastic tour guides might tell you, the cemetery in which the von Trapps hide from the Nazis is a Hollywood studio set, though its design is clearly based on St Peter\u2019s Graveyard, which you can see just off Kapitelplatz. The mountain over which the family finally escapes to freedom is above the village of Obersalzburg with views of the Untersberg in the distance, near the village of Rossfeld, on the 319, 12 miles south of Salzburg. \u2022 Many thanks to Lieselotte Mayrhofer; and to Bryan Crawford of Edelweiss Tours for help with this section.

Adapted from the 1959 stage musical of the same name, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is actually based on the memoir, titled \u2018The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u2019. The story deals with a postulant, who goes to the imposing home of a retired naval officer. The man is a widower, and the young woman acts as a governess to his children. Soon enough, she brings music and love to the entire family, and it is not long before she falls in love with her employer as well. Together they band, as they have to face the loss of their motherland to the Nazis. If you have seen the movie, you already know that it takes place in Salzburg in Austria. Over the course of the film, there are several iconic scenes that have been shot at picturesque locations, or there are some locations that have been simply elevated due to the value of the scene itself (think of the gazebo where \u2018Sixteen Going on Seventeen\u2019 is performed). Naturally, you might be wondering about the exact filming locations of this popular movie, and we have got you covered in that regard. When \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 started filming, the crew did not head immediately to the real locations for the movie. Instead, when principal photography began on March 26, 1964, it started at the 20th Century Fox studios located in Los Angeles. Following this, the crew headed to Salzburg, where they filmed at a variety of locations including the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and Residence Fountain, among others. Filming commenced here from April 23, to around May 22. Various other locations nearby were used, and shooting went on till around June 19. The crew also hit up places nearby including Werfen in the Salzach River valley. Some scenes were also shot in Bavaria, with the Alps serving as a wonderful backdrop. Around July 6, the team headed back to Los Angeles for the remaining scenes, and principal photography ultimately wrapped up by September 1, 1964. As is evident, a plethora of locations have been hit in this frenzied shooting schedule, and we now proceed to the specific filming locations, rendered memorable by the iconic scenes that have unfolded there. Salzburg in Austria serves as the place where most of the pivotal scenes of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place. Some of the most recognizable locations include Mirabell Palace and Gardens. If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you must know that \u2018Do re mi\u2019 is one of the most popular songs. The ending of this song sees Maria and the von Trapp kids at the Mirabell Palace and Gardens. Located in Salzburg\u2019s old town, we can see the movie characters dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, which is located in front of the palace. The other recognizable locations happen to be the rose garden at the north of the fountain and the Greek fencing statues at the entrance. Residenzplatz Square and Fountain also plays an important part, early on, as Maria can be seen splashing in the baroque horse fountain here, while \u2018I Have Confidence in Me\u2019 is playing. When Germany annexes Austria, we see Nazi soldiers marching through this square, while a Swastika flag is raised above the Old Residence Palace\u2019s entrance. The Summer Riding School (Felsenreitschule) is where the von Trapp family takes the stage, performing \u2018Edelweiss\u2019 and \u2018So long, Farewell\u2019, for the Folk Festival. Notably, hundreds of extras were hired for the scene to sing along. A little away from this location, on Herbert von Karajan Square, is the Horse Pond, where Maria and the children dance at the end of \u2018My Favorite Things\u2019. Leopoldskron Palace is important in its own way since all the lake terrace scenes of the von Trapp family home were shot here. Schloss Frohnburg was also used to show the von Trapp house, rather the intimidating front gates which Maria nervously approaches initially. Nonnberg Abbey Convent is where Maria lived, and the exteriors of the same have been used in the movie. However, the movie has taken some liberties here, as the convent does not actually look over the old town of Salzburg, but instead has a view of the nondescript southern suburbs. St. Michael Basilica in Mondsee, outside Salzburg, is remarkable because Maria gets married to Georg von Trapp, in one of the most famous scenes from the movie. Werfen, which is around a 40-minute drive away from Salzburg, has the Gschwandtanger Meadow, which\n\nquestion: What scenes were filmed at Nonnberg Abbey?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The exteriors of Nonnberg Abbey were used in the movie.", "usage": 1093}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Bavaria is important for being one of the first scenes where Maria makes her entrance. She can be seen twirling at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg. The sequence where the von Trapps escape the Nazis is also shot on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. Notably, Stage 8 and Stage 15 were used in the studios, but a lot of important scenes were shot there. Firstly, shooting inside the convent was not allowed, meaning that the set was created in the studio itself. The golden foyer and the ballroom, we see in the house, were also recreated in Hollywood. There is an important scene where the Von Trapp family hides from the Nazis behind some tombs. While the scenes have been recreated in Hollywood, they closely resemble St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery and Catacombs in Salzburg. The gazebo where two of the finest songs in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place, that is, \u2018Something Good\u2019 and \u201916 going on 17\u2032, is actually both a real-life location as well as something created in a studio. The real-life gazebo is near the Eastern entrance to the Hellbrunn Palace. A larger one was rebuilt in Hollywood where most of the scenes were actually shot. As is evident, the scenes in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 have been carefully shot to capture the beauty of the location and to transport us into this enchanting world inhabited by the von Trapp family and Maria. Making the best use of the locations is just one small aspect that has helped this film go down in history as one of the most memorable examples of great cinema.

The film is an adaptation of the 1959 stage musical, composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and a book by Lindsay and Crouse. Based on the 1949 memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria von Trapp, the film is set in Salzburg, Austria and is a fictional retelling of her experiences as governess to seven children, her eventual marriage with their father Captain Georg Von Trapp, and their escape during the Anschluss in 1938. Filming took place from March to September 1964 in Los Angeles and Salzburg. The Sound of Music was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited roadshow theatrical release. Although initial critical response to the film was mixed, it was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office film after four weeks, and the highest-grossing film of 1965. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all-time\u2014surpassing Gone with the Wind\u2014and held that distinction for five years. The film was just as popular throughout the world, breaking previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries. Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years, and two successful re-releases, the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286 million. The Sound of Music received five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Wise's second pair of both awards, the first being from the 1961 film West Side Story. The film also received two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture and Best Actress, the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. In 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) listed The Sound of Music as the fifty-fifth greatest American film of all time, and the fourth-greatest film musical. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg in 1938. Her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern. Mother Abbess sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children\u2014Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children out of drapes that are to be changed. She takes them around Salzburg and the mountains while teaching them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake which concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain attempts to fire Maria. However, he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. The Captain apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay. Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes that he enters them in the upcoming Salzburg Festival, but the Captain disapproves of letting his children sing in public. During a grand party at the villa, where guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional L\u00e4ndler folk dance, he steps in and partners Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy by indirectly convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. However, Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, so she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her purpose in life. When Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. However, the Baroness learns that the Captain's feelings\n\nquestion: What scenes were filmed at Nonnberg Abbey?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1121}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

While the couple is on their honeymoon, Max enters the children into the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. Having learned that Austria has been annexed by the Third Reich, the couple return to their home, where the Captain receives a telegram, ordering him to report to the German Naval base at Bremerhaven to accept a commission in the Kriegsmarine. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and their ideology, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. That night, the von Trapp family attempt to flee to Switzerland, but they are stopped by a group of Brownshirts, led by the Gauleiter Hans Zeller, waiting outside the villa. To cover his family's tracks, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven. Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slips away and seeks shelter at the abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Zeller and his men soon arrive and search the abbey, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When they attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start, as two of the nuns have sabotaged their engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom. The real Maria von Trapp has a brief uncredited cameo as a passerby, alongside her children Rosmarie and Werner von Trapp during \"I Have Confidence\". The Sound of Music story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, published in 1949 to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband Georg in 1947. Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told. In 1956, German producer Wolfgang Liebeneiner purchased the film rights for $9,000 (equivalent to $97,000 in 2022), hired George Hurdalek and Herbert Reinecker to write the screenplay, and Franz Grothe to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional Austrian folk songs. The Trapp Family was released in West Germany on October 9, 1956, and became a major success. Two years later, Liebeneiner directed a sequel, The Trapp Family in America, and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years. Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America. In 1956, Paramount Pictures purchased the United States film rights, intending to produce an English-language version with Audrey Hepburn as Maria. The studio eventually dropped its option, but one of its directors, Vincent J. Donehue, proposed the story as a stage musical for Mary Martin. Producers Richard Halliday and Leland Heyward secured the rights and hired playwrights Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, who had won the Pulitzer Prize for State of the Union. They approached Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II to compose one song for the musical, but the composers felt the two styles\u2014traditional Austrian folk songs and their composition\u2014would not work together. They offered to write a completely new score for the entire production if the producers were willing to wait while they completed work on Flower Drum Song. The producers quickly responded that they would wait as long as necessary. The Sound of Music stage musical opened on November 16, 1959, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York City and ran on Broadway for 1,443 performances, winning six Tony Awards, including Best Musical. In June 1960, Twentieth Century-Fox purchased the film adaptation rights to the stage musical for $1.25 million (equivalent to $12,400,000 in 2022) against ten percent of the gross. In December 1962, 20th Century-Fox president Richard D. Zanuck hired Ernest Lehman to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of the stage musical. Lehman reviewed the original script for the stage musical, rearranged the sequence of songs, and began transforming a work designed for the stage into a film that could use the camera to emphasize action and mood and open the story up to the beautiful locations of Salzburg and the Austrian Alps. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" sequence in the play, for example, was originally a stagnant number; Lehman transformed it into a lively montage showing some of the beautiful sites of Salzburg, as well as showing Maria and the children growing closer over time. Lehman also eliminated two songs, \"How Can Love Survive?\" and \"No Way to Stop It\", sung by the characters of Elsa and Max.

Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material. While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director. Their first choice was Robert Wise, with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of West Side Story, but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, The Sand Pebbles. Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including Stanley Donen, Vincent J. Donehue, George Roy Hill, and Gene Kelly. In January 1963, Lehman invited one of his favorite directors, William Wyler, to travel to New York City with him to see the Broadway musical. After seeing the show, Wyler said he hated it, but after two weeks of Lehman's persuasion, Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film. After hiring musical supervisor Roger Edens, Wyler, Lehman, and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations. In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy-five locations\u2014an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences. During that trip, Lehman began to have reservations about Wyler's commitment to the project and communicated this to Zanuck, who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible. Lehman completed the first draft on September 10, 1963, and sent it to Wyler, who had no suggestions or changes to add. At that time, Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise, whom Lehman still wanted as the director. Later that month, Wyler's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct The Collector. Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film, and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director, ending Wyler's participation. Meanwhile, Wise, whose film The Sand Pebbles had been postponed, read Lehman's first draft, was impressed by what he read, and agreed to direct the film, joining the picture in October 1963, and flew to Salzburg with associate producer Saul Chaplin and members of his production team to scout filming locations, including many that Wyler had identified. When he returned, Wise began working on the script. Wise shared Lehman's vision of the film being centered on the music, and the changes he made were consistent with the writer's approach\u2014mainly reducing the amount of sweetness and sentimentality found in the stage musical. He had reservations about Lehman's opening aerial sequence because West Side Story, whose screenplay Lehman had also written, had used a similar opening sequence, but he was unable to think of a better one and decided to keep Lehman's. Other changes included replacing \"An Ordinary Couple\" with a more romantic number, and a new song for Maria's departure from the abbey\u2014Rodgers provided \"Something Good\" and \"I Have Confidence\", especially for the film. Lehman completed the second draft on December 20, 1963, but additional changes would be made based on input from Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer about the character of the Captain. Plummer especially helped change a character lacking substance into a stronger, more forceful complex figure with a wry sense of humor and a darker edge. Lehman completed his final draft on March 20, 1964. Lehman's first and only choice for Maria was Julie Andrews. When Wise joined the project, he made a list of his choices for the role, which included Andrews as his first choice, Grace Kelly, and Shirley Jones. Wise and Lehman went to Disney Studios to view footage from Mary Poppins, which was not yet released. A few minutes into the film, Wise told Lehman, \"Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this film and grabs her!\" Andrews had some reservations\u2014mainly about the amount of sweetness in the theatrical version\u2014but when she learned that her concerns were shared by Wise and Lehman and what their vision was, she signed a contract with Fox to star in The Sound of Music and one other film for $225,000 (equivalent to $2,120,000 in 2022). Wise had a more difficult time casting the role of the Captain. A number of actors were considered for the part, including Bing Crosby, Yul Brynner, Sean Connery, and Richard Burton. Wise had seen Christopher Plummer on Broadway and wanted him for the role, but the stage actor turned down the offer several times. Wise flew to London to meet with Plummer and explained his concept of the film; the actor accepted after being assured that he could work with Lehman to improve the character. Wise also spent considerable time and effort on casting the secondary characters. For the role of Max Detweiler, Wise initially considered Victor Borge, No\u00ebl Coward, and Hal Holbrook among others before deciding on Richard Haydn. For the character of Baroness Elsa Schraeder\n\nquestion: What scenes were filmed at Nonnberg Abbey?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1123}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The casting of the children's characters began in November 1963 and involved over two hundred interviews and auditions throughout the United States and England. Some of the child actors interviewed or tested, who were not selected, included Mia Farrow, Patty Duke, Lesley Ann Warren, Geraldine Chaplin, Shelley Fabares, Teri Garr, Kurt Russell, and The Osmonds. Most of the actors selected had some acting, singing, or dancing experience. Charmian Carr, however, was a model who worked part-time in a doctor's office and had no ambition to pursue a career as an actress. After a friend sent her photo to Wise's office, she was asked to interview. Wise later recalled, \"She was so pretty and had such poise and charm that we liked her immediately.\" The last person to be cast was Daniel Truhitte in the role of Rolfe. Rehearsals for the singing and dance sequences began on February 10, 1964. The husband-and-wife team of Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, who had worked with Andrews on Mary Poppins, worked out the choreography with Saul Chaplin on piano\u2014the arrangements could not be altered under Rodgers and Hammerstein's contract. The stage choreography was not used because it was too restrictive. Breaux and Wood worked out all-new choreography better suited for the film that incorporated many of the Salzburg locations and settings. They even choreographed the newly added puppet dance sequence for \"The Lonely Goatherd\". The choreography for the L\u00e4ndler strictly followed the traditional Austrian folk dance. The musical arranger Irwin Kostal prerecorded the songs with a large orchestra and singers on a stage before the start of filming. In her book, The Sound of Music: The Making of America's Favorite Movie, Julia Antopol Hirsch says that Kostal used seven children and five adults to record the children's voices; the only scene in which the child-actors' singing is heard in the released version of the film is when they sing \"The Sound of Music\" on their own after Maria leaves. Charmian Carr refuted the claim that the voices of the child actors were dubbed in the film and on the soundtrack. Carr contended that all of the children who are in the film sing on the track, but four other children were added to most of the songs to give them a fuller sound; they did not replace them as singers. The voices of some of the adult actors had voice doubles, including those of Peggy Wood and Christopher Plummer. Principal photography began on March 26, 1964, at 20th Century-Fox studios in Los Angeles, where scenes from Maria's bedroom and the abbey cloister and graveyard were filmed. The company then flew to Salzburg, where filming resumed on April 23 at Mondsee Abbey for the wedding scenes. From April 25 through May 22, scenes were filmed at the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, Residence Fountain, and various street locations throughout the Altstadt (Old Town) area of the city. Wise faced opposition from city leaders who did not want him staging scenes with swastika banners. They relented after he threatened instead to include old newsreel footage featuring the banners. On days when it rained, a constant challenge for the company, Wise arranged for scenes to be shot at St. Margarethen Chapel and D\u00fcrer Studios (Reverend Mother's office). From May 23 to June 7, the company worked at Schloss Leopoldskron and an adjacent property called Bertelsmann for scenes representing the lakeside terrace and gardens of the von Trapp villa. From June 9 to 19, scenes were shot at Frohnburg Palace, which represented the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa. Karath could not swim and was in danger during the capsizing boat scene. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" picnic scene in the mountains was filmed above the town of Werfen in the Salzach River valley on June 25 and 27. The opening sequence of Maria on her mountain was filmed from June 28 to July 2 at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg in Bavaria. During filming, Birch trees were added and then removed. The brook she walks through was plastic filled with water which was put there during filming. The final scene of the von Trapp family escaping over the mountains was filmed on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. The cast and crew flew back to Los Angeles and resumed filming at Fox Studios on July 6 for all remaining scenes, including those in the villa dining room, ballroom, terrace, living room, and gazebo. Following the last two scenes shot in the gazebo\u2014for the songs \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Sevent\n\nquestion: What scenes were filmed at Nonnberg Abbey?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1119}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A total of eighty-three scenes were filmed in just over five months. Post-production work began on August 25 with three weeks of dialogue dubbing to correct lines that were ruined by various street noises and rain. In October, Christopher Plummer's singing voice was dubbed by veteran Disney playback singer Bill Lee. The film was then edited by Wise and film editor William Reynolds. Once the film was edited, Irwin Kostal, who orchestrated the musical numbers, underscored the film with background music consisting of variations on Rodgers and Hammerstein's original songs to amplify or add nuances to the visual images. When dubbing, editing, and scoring were complete, Wise arranged for two sneak-preview showings\u2014the first one held in Minneapolis on Friday, January 15, 1965 at the Mann Theater, and the second one held the following night in Tulsa. Despite the \"sensational\" responses from the preview audiences, Wise made a few final editing changes before completing the film. According to the original print information for the film, the running time for the theatrical release version was 174 minutes. The film was still in release when the Motion Picture Association of America's film ratings system was implemented in 1968, and was subsequently given a \"G\" rating (\"general audiences\") in 1969. The Sound of Music was filmed in Todd-AO by Ted McCord and produced with DeLuxe Color processing. Aerial footage was photographed with an MCS-70 camera. The sound was recorded on a 70 mm six-track using a Westrex recording system. The sets used for the film were based on the storyboards of sketch artist Maurice Zuberano, who accompanied Wise to Austria to scout filming locations in November 1963. Wise met with the artist over ten weeks and explained his objective for each scene\u2014the feeling he wanted to convey and the visual images he wanted to use. When Zuberano was finished, he provided Wise with a complete set of storyboards that illustrated each scene and set\u2014storyboards the director used as guidance during filming. Zuberano's storyboards and location photos were also used by art director Boris Leven to design and construct all of the original interior sets at Fox studios, as well as some external sets in Salzburg. The von Trapp villa, for example, was actually filmed in several locations: the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa were filmed at Frohnburg Palace, the lakeside terrace and gardens was a set constructed on a property adjacent to Schloss Leopoldskron called Bertelsmann, and the interior was a constructed set at Fox Studios. The gazebo scenes for \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" were filmed on a larger reconstructed set at Fox studios, while some shots of the original gazebo were filmed on the grounds at Schloss Leopoldskron in Salzburg. Most of the soundtrack to The Sound of Music was written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and arranged and conducted by Irwin Kostal, who also adapted the instrumental underscore passages. Both the lyrics and music for two new songs were written by Rodgers, as Hammerstein died in 1960. The soundtrack album was released by RCA Victor in 1965 and is one of the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 20 million copies worldwide. The album reached the number one position on the Billboard 200 that year in the United States. It remained in the top ten for 109 weeks, from May 1, 1965, to July 16, 1967, and remained on the Billboard 200 chart for 238 weeks. The album was the best-selling album in the United Kingdom in 1965, 1966, and 1968 and the second best-selling of the entire decade, spending a total of 70 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It also stayed 73 weeks on the Norwegian charts, becoming the seventh best-charting album of all time in that country. In 2015, Billboard named the album the second greatest album of all time. The album has been reissued several times, including anniversary editions with additional tracks in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Wise hired Mike Kaplan to direct the publicity campaign for the film. After reading the script, Kaplan decided on the ad line \"The Happiest Sound in All the World\", which would appear on promotional material and artwork. Kaplan also brought in outside agencies to work with the studio's advertising department to develop the promotional artwork, eventually selecting a painting by Howard Terpning of Andrews on an alpine meadow with her carpetbag and guitar case in hand with the children and Plummer in the background. In February 1964, Kaplan began placing ads in the trade papers Daily Variety, Weekly Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter to attract future exhibitor interest in the project. The studio intended the film to have an initial roadshow theatrical release in select large cities in theaters that could accommodate the 70-mm screenings and six-track stereophonic sound. The roadshow concept involved two show\n\nquestion: What scenes were filmed at Nonnberg Abbey?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1144}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Kaplan identified forty key cities that would likely be included in the roadshow release and developed a promotional strategy targeting the major newspapers of those cities. During the Salzburg production phase, 20th Century-Fox organized press junkets for American journalists to interview Wise and his team and the cast members. \"No one is comfortable with an excess of hearts and flowers, but there is no valid reason for hiding honest emotion. This has always been a major element in the theatre, and it's my conviction that anyone who can't, on occasion, be sentimental about children, home or nature is sadly maladjusted.\" Richard Rodgers The film had its opening premiere on March 2, 1965, at the Rivoli Theater in New York City. Initial reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's \"romantic nonsense and sentiment\", the children's \"artificial roles\", and Robert Wise's \"cosy-cum-corny\" direction. Judith Crist, in a biting review in the New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as \"icky sticky\" and designed for \"the five to seven set and their mommies\". In her review for McCall's magazine, Pauline Kael called the film \"the sugar-coated lie people seem to want to eat\", and that audiences have \"turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs.\" Wise later recalled, \"The East Coast, intellectual papers and magazines destroyed us, but the local papers and the trades gave us great reviews\". Indeed, reviewers such as Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \"three hours of visual and vocal brilliance\", and Variety called it \"a warmly-pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast\". The \"wildly mixed film reviews\" reflected the critical response to the stage musical, according to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical. After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10, The Sound of Music opened in 131 theaters in the United States, including a limited number of roadshow events. After four weeks, the film became the number one box office movie in the country and held that position for thirty out of the next forty-three weeks in 1965. The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years. A few months after its United States release, The Sound of Music opened in 261 theaters in other countries, the first American movie to be completely dubbed in a foreign language, both dialogue, and music. The German, French, Italian, and Spanish versions were completely dubbed, the Japanese version had Japanese dialogue with English songs, and other versions were released with foreign subtitles. The film was a popular success in every country it opened, except the two countries where the story originated, Austria and Germany. In these two countries, the film had to compete with the much-loved Die Trapp-Familie (1956), which provided the original inspiration for the Broadway musical, and its sequel Die Trapp-Familie in Amerika (1958); both films are still widely popular in German-speaking Europe and considered the authoritative von Trapp story. Austrians took exception to the liberties taken by the filmmakers with regard to the costumes, which did not reflect the traditional style and the replacement of traditional Austrian folk songs with Broadway show tunes. The film's Nazi theme was especially unpopular in Germany, where the Munich branch manager for 20th Century-Fox approved the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act of the film following the wedding sequence\u2014the scenes showing Salzburg following the Anschluss. Robert Wise and the studio intervened, the original film was restored, and the branch manager was fired. The Sound of Music holds an 84% \"Certified Fresh\" score on Rotten Tomatoes based on seventy-four reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's consensus states: \"Unapologetically sweet and maybe even a little corny, The Sound of Music will win over all but the most cynical filmgoers with its classic songs and irresistible warmth.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on eleven critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The Sound of Music is one of the most commercially successful films of all time. Four weeks after its theatrical release, it became the number one box office movie in the United States, from revenue generated by twenty-five theaters, each screening only ten roadshow performances per week. It held the number one position for thirty of the next forty-three weeks, and ended up the highest-grossing film of 1965. One contributing factor in the film's early commercial success was the repeat business of many filmgoers. In some cities in the United States, the number of tickets sold exceeded the total population.

Worldwide, The Sound of Music broke previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries, including the United Kingdom, where it played for a record-breaking three years at the Dominion Theatre in London and earned \u00a34 million in rentals and grossed \u00a36 million\u2014more than twice as much as any other film had taken in. It was also a major success in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, where it played for as long as two years at some theaters. It was not a universal success, however, with the film only enjoying modest success in France and it was a flop in Germany. It also initially performed poorly in Italy, but a re-release after the Oscars brought better results. It was number one at the US box office for a further 11 weeks in 1966, for a total of 41 weeks at number one. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all time, with over $67.5 million in worldwide rentals ($125 million in gross receipts), surpassing Gone with the Wind, which held that distinction for twenty-four years. It was still in the top ten at the US box office in its 100th week of release. The Sound of Music completed its initial four-and-a-half year theatrical release run in the United States on Labor Day 1969, the longest initial run for a film in the US, having earned $68,313,000 in rentals in the United States and Canada. It played for 142 weeks at the Eglinton Theatre in Toronto. It was the first film to gross over $100 million. By December 1970, it had earned $121.5 million in worldwide rentals, which was over four times higher than the film's estimated break-even point of $29.5 million in rentals. The film was re-released in 1973, and increased its North American rentals to $78.4 million. By the end of the 1970s, it was ranked seventh in all-time North American rentals, having earned $79 million. The film's re-release in 1990 increased the total North American admissions to 142,415,400\u2014the third-highest number of tickets sold behind Gone with the Wind and Star Wars\u2014and about 283.3 million admissions worldwide. The Sound of Music eventually earned a total domestic gross of $163,214,076 and a total worldwide gross of $286,214,076. Adjusted for inflation, the film earned about $2.366 billion at 2014 prices\u2014placing it among the top ten highest-grossing films of all time. The Sound of Music has been included in numerous top film lists from the American Film Institute. The first American television transmission of The Sound of Music was on February 29, 1976, on ABC, which paid $15 million (equivalent to $77,140,351 in 2022) for a one-time only broadcast that became one of the top 20 rated films shown on television to that point with a Nielsen rating of 33.6 and an audience share of 49%. The movie was not shown again until NBC acquired the broadcast rights in June 1977 for $21.5 million for 20 showings over 22 years and telecast the film on February 11, 1979. NBC continued to air the film annually for twenty years. During most of its run on NBC, the film was heavily edited to fit a three-hour time slot\u2014approximately 140 minutes without commercials, which inevitably cut 30 minutes out of the original film. The film aired in its uncut form (minus the entr'acte) on April 9, 1995, on NBC. Julie Andrews hosted the four-hour telecast which presented the musical numbers in a letterboxed format. As the film's home video availability cut into its television ratings, NBC let their contract lapse in 2001. That year, the film was broadcast one time on the Fox network, in its heavily edited 140-minute version. Since 2002, the film has aired on ABC on a Sunday night prior to Christmas and has been broadcast on its sister cable network, Freeform, periodically around Easter and other holidays. Most of its more recent runs have been the full version in a four-hour time slot, complete with the entr'acte. ABC first broadcast a high-definition version on December 28, 2008. On December 22, 2013, the annual broadcast had its highest ratings since 2007; the increase in ratings were credited to NBC's broadcast of The Sound of Music Live!\u2014a live television adaptation of the original musical which aired earlier that month. In the United Kingdom, the film rights were acquired by the BBC, who paid a corporation record $4.1 million, and it was first aired on BBC One on 25 December 1978 and, as of December 2016, fifteen times since, mostly around Christmas time.

The first DVD version was released on August 29, 2000, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the film's release. The film is often included in box sets with other Rodgers & Hammerstein film adaptations. A 40th anniversary DVD, with \"making of\" documentaries and special features, was released on November 15, 2005. The film made its debut issue on Blu-ray Disc on November 2, 2010, for its 45th anniversary. For the Blu-ray release, the original 70 mm negatives were rescanned at 8K resolution, then restored and remastered at 4K resolution for the transfer to Blu-ray, giving the most detailed copy of the film seen thus far. On March 10, 2015, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released The Sound of Music 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition\u2014a five-disc set featuring thirteen hours of bonus features, including a new documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg. A March 2015 episode of ABC's 20/20 entitled The Untold Story of the Sound of Music featured a preview of the documentary and interviews by Diane Sawyer. In part to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, the film was made available on the Disney+ streaming service upon its debut on November 12, 2019. The Sound of Music film adaptation, like the stage musical, presents a history of the von Trapp family (a.k.a. the Trapp Family) that is not completely accurate. The musical was based on the West German film The Trapp Family (1956) rather than Maria von Trapp's 1949 memoirs, as director Vincent J. Donehue had seen the film and decided that it would make a good vehicle for Mary Martin. The musical followed the film's plot so closely that the New York Times review of the West German film noticed that it \"strongly suggests 'The Sound of Music,' often scene by scene.\" The West German screenwriters made several significant changes to the family's story that were kept in the musical. Maria had been hired to teach just one child, but the 1956 film made her governess to all seven children. The 1965 film adaptation was influenced by other musicals of its era, such as Mary Poppins, the Rodgers and Hammerstein television production of Cinderella, and the stage production of Lerner and Loewe's Camelot (coincidentally all starring Julie Andrews). Screenwriter Ernest Lehman was inspired by the opening of West Side Story and saw the musical as \"a fairy tale that's almost real\". The film incorporated many \"fairy tale\" tropes which included the idyllic imagery (placed in the hills of Salzburg), the European villas, and the cross-class Cinderella-like romance between Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As Maria walks down the aisle to be married, the pageantry is explicitly both Guinevere and Cinderella. In keeping with this tone the filmmakers used artistic license to convey the essence and meaning of their story. Georg Ludwig von Trapp was indeed an anti-Nazi opposed to the Anschluss, and lived with his family in a villa in a district of Salzburg called Aigen. Their lifestyle depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living. The actual family villa, located at Traunstra\u00dfe 34, Aigen 5026, was large and comfortable but not nearly as grand as the mansion depicted in the film. The house was also not their ancestral home, as depicted in the film. The family had previously lived in homes in Zell Am See and Klosterneuburg after being forced to abandon their actual ancestral home in Pola following World War I. Georg moved the family to the Salzburg villa shortly after the death of his first wife, Agathe Whitehead, in 1922. Georg is referred to as \"Captain\" in the film, but he held a noble title of \"Ritter\" (hereditary knight), which had higher social status than a naval officer. Although Austrian nobility was legally abolished in 1919 and the nobiliary particle von was proscribed, both continued to be widely used unofficially as a matter of social courtesy. Georg was offered a position in the German Kriegsmarine; Nazi Germany was looking to expand its fleet of U-boats, and Corvette Captain von Trapp was the most successful Austro-Hungarian submarine commander of World War I, having sunk 11 Allied merchant ships totaling 47,653 GRT and two Allied warships displacing a total of 12,641 tons. With his family in desperate financial straits, he seriously considered the offer before deciding he could not serve a Nazi regime. In the film, Georg is depicted initially as a humorless, emotionally distant father. In reality, third child Maria Franziska von Trapp (\n\nquestion: What scenes were filmed at Nonnberg Abbey?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1141}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She has a different recollection of her stepmother, Maria Augusta Kutschera, whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage. In a 2003 interview, Maria remembered, \" had a terrible temper... and from one moment to the next, you didn't know what hit her. We were not used to this. But we took it like a thunderstorm that would pass, because the next minute she could be very nice.\" Maria Kutschera had indeed been a novice at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and had been hired by the von Trapp family. However, she was hired only to be a tutor to young Maria Franziska, who had come down with scarlet fever and needed her lessons at home, not to be a governess for all of the children. Maria and Georg married for practical reasons, rather than love and affection for each other. Georg needed a mother for his children, and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey. \"I really and truly was not in love,\" Maria wrote in her memoir, \"I liked him but didn't love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children. I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after.\" They were married in 1927, not in 1938 as depicted in the film, and the couple had been married for over a decade by the time of the Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time. Maria and Georg enjoyed a happy marriage. The von Trapp family lost most of its wealth during the worldwide depression of the early 1930s, when the Austrian national bank folded. In order to survive, the family dismissed the servants and began taking in boarders. They also started singing onstage to earn money, a fact that caused the proud Georg much embarrassment. In the film, the von Trapp family hike over the Alps from Austria to Switzerland to escape the Nazis, which would not have been possible; Salzburg is over two hundred miles from Switzerland. The von Trapp villa, however, was only a few kilometers from the Austria\u2013Germany border, and the final scene shows the family hiking on the Obersalzberg near the German town of Berchtesgaden, within sight of Adolf Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus Eagle's Nest retreat. In reality, the family simply walked to the local train station and boarded a train to Italy. The Trapps were entitled to Italian citizenship since Georg had been born in Zadar, Dalmatia, Austria-Hungary, which had been annexed by Italy after World War I. They were able to emigrate to the United States via the United Kingdom on their Italian passports. The fictional character Max Detweiler, who acted as the scheming family music director in the film, is based on the von Trapps' family priest, the Reverend Franz Wasner, who was their musical director for over twenty years and, unlike Max, accompanied them when they left Austria. The character of Friedrich, the second oldest child in the film version, was based on Rupert, the oldest of the real von Trapp children. Liesl, the oldest child in the film, was based on Agathe von Trapp, the second oldest in the real family. The names and ages of the children were changed, in part because the third child, who would be portrayed as \"Louisa\", was also named Maria, and producers thought that it would be confusing to have two characters called Maria in the film. The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers. Robert Wise met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to Richard Zanuck, that he was not making a \"documentary or realistic movie\" about her family, and that he would make the film with \"complete dramatic freedom\" in order to produce a \"fine and moving film\", one they could all be proud of. Although The Sound of Music is set in Salzburg, it was largely ignored in Austria upon release. The film adaptation was a blockbuster worldwide, but it ran for only three days in Salzburg movie theaters, with locals showing \"disdain\" for a film that \"wasn't authentic.\" In 1966, American Express created the first Sound of Music guided tour in Salzburg. Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been the leading Sound of Music bus tour company in the city, taking approximately 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region. Although the Salzburg tourism industry took advantage of the attention from foreign tourists, residents of the city were apathetic\n\nquestion: What scenes were filmed at Nonnberg Abbey?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1125}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A German translation of the musical was performed on the national stage for the first time in 2005 at the Vienna Volksoper, receiving negative reviews from Austrian critics, who called it \"boring\" and referred to \"Edelweiss\" as \"an insult to Austrian musical creation.\" The musical finally premiered in Salzburg in 2011 at the Salzburger Landestheater, but Maria was played in the Salzburg premiere by a Dutch actress who \"grew up with the songs.\" However, most performances in Vienna and Salzburg were sold out, and the musical is now in both companies' repertoire. A Sing-along Sound of Music revival screening was first shown at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 1999, leading to a successful run at the Prince Charles Cinema which is ongoing as of 2018. During the screenings, audience members are often dressed as nuns and von Trapp children and are encouraged to sing along to lyrics superimposed on the screen. In July 2000, Sing-along Sound of Music shows opened in Boston, Massachusetts, and Austin, Texas. Some audience members dressed up as cast members and interacted with the action shown on the screen. The film began a successful run at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City in September 2000, with the opening attended by cast members Charmian Carr (Liesl), Daniel Truhitte (Rolfe), and Kym Karath (Gretl). Sing-along Sound of Music screenings have since become an international phenomenon. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The Academy Film Archive preserved The Sound of Music in 2003.

Directed by the multiple Academy Award winning luminary Robert Wise (who also directed \u2018West Side Story\u2019), the film boasted the talents of Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and was phenomenal commercial success, managing to rake in three hundred million dollars way back in the 1960s. Today, the legacy of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is irreproachable, having five Academy Awards to its name and enduring renown that continues to make the film relevant even today. Based on the 1959 stage musical of the same name (which in turn is based on the memoir \u201cThe Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u201d by Maria von Trapp), \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 follows the von Trapp family and their new governess Maria. Maria is a struggling nun who is assigned the job of taking care of the exceedingly mischievous seven von Trapp children. Their father, Georg von Trapp, is a retired naval captain who runs his household with military discipline after the death of his wife. While initially cold and hostile towards Maria, the von Trapp children eventually fall for her kind demeanor and melodious personality. Even the stoic captain finds himself falling for Maria affable charms but their idyllic lifestyle is threatened when the Nazis start to take over their country. If you were wondering what were \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 filming locations, read on. The backdrop for much of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is the charming pre World War II town of Salzburg in Austria during the 1930s. The scenery shows off distant snow-capped mountain peaks, verdant hilltops perfect for breaking into a spontaneous melody, and cultured medieval buildings that occupy the imagination. While it is possible to recreate these distinctive features of the region on a set as well, such a facsimile is unlikely to be nearly as authentic as the real thing. This is especially true of the 1960s when CGI wasn\u2019t really an option for filmmakers. Keeping this in mind, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 was largely filmed on location in Austria itself, specifically in the city of Salzburg. Limited filming for scenes was also done in studio in California, as well as a few scenes in Bavaria, Germany. Principal filming commenced in late March 1964 and concluded later that year in September.

The production started out with the filming of Maria\u2019s bedroom scenes as well as the nun Abbey cloister. Sketch artist Maurice Zuberano accompanied director Robert Wise to scout for locations in Austria. After a ten week period, Zuberano prepared a set of storyboards and location photos to art director Boris Leven, who designed and constructed the interior sets at Fox Studios in painstaking detail. It is on these sets that parts of the gazebo scenes in the wildly popular songs \u201cSomething Good\u201d and \u201cSixteen Going on Seventeen\u201d were filmed. The 20th century Fox Studios have served as the filming location for many world renowned films and TV shows including \u2018Modern Family\u2019, \u2018Fight Club\u2019, \u2018Edward Scissorhands\u2019, and \u2018Arrested Development\u2019. The majority of the filming for \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 took place in and around the delightful city of Salzburg in Austria. The wedding scenes were filmed at the Benedictine monastery of Mondsee Abbey in Upper Austria, with on location filming also done at Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and the Altstadt Old Town area of Salzburg.

Start Traveling. Austria \u2022 See & Do One of the most famous musical films, The Sound of Music, which was filmed in 1965 is still loved by many today. Each year hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Salzburg, Austria to walk in the footsteps of the legendary Von Trapp family. If you are a fan of the movie and wondering where the Sound of Music was filmed, you\u2019ve come to the right place. From the gazebo where Liesl sings \u201c16 going on 17\u201d to the Abbey where Maria lived and got married, here are all the must-visit Sound of Music filming locations. Recommendation: Relive the scenes of some of the most popular Sound of Music locations in Salzburg including Leopoldskron Palace, Nonnberg Abbey, and Mirabell Gardens on a guided Sound of Music tour. With an English speaking guide, and songs from the soundtrack playing throughout the tour, this Original Sound of Music tour from Salzburg won\u2019t disappoint! Marvel at the breathtaking locations for the Sound of Music and sing through the streets of Salzburg. Founded in 714 A.D., Nonnberg Abbey (German: Stift Nonnberg) is the oldest female convent north of the Alps and is where the real-life Maria became a novice nun and got married to Georg von Trapp. Nonnberg is where four scenes from the movie were filmed: the scene of the nuns singing \u201cMaria\u201d in the courtyard, Maria leaving the abbey, the kids visiting her at the abbey, and the Nazi\u2019s hunting the Von Trapps. Visitors will notice the interior of the Abbey is different from the movie, as filming inside the convent was not allowed, so the interior scenes were shot in a Hollywood studio. A highlight of this Sound of Music location in Salzburg is hearing the resident nuns Gregorian chants in Latin at 6:45 in the morning inside the beautiful Gothic abbey. The small yet beautiful flower filled St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery (German: Petersfriedhof) was the inspiration for the cemetery rebuilt on set for the scene towards the end of the movie in which the Von Trapps hide from the Nazis behind tombs. Beside being the resting place of Mozart\u2019s sister, Nannerl, this is also the resting place of Max Detweiler, \u201cUncle Max\u201d from the movie. This unique cemetery is one of the oldest (and most beautiful) cemeteries in the world and is Salzburg\u2019s oldest Christian cemetery. The catacombs carved out of the rocks of M\u00f6nchsberg provide a stunning view over the beautiful cemetery and should be visited during your Sound of Music tour in Salzburg. This baroque style garden, which was built in 1606 by the archbishop Wolf Dietrich for his mistress is a beautifully landscaped garden filled with gorgeous flowers, marble statues, fountains, and ample opportunities to reenact scenes from the movies. The iconic song, \u201cDo Re, Mi\u201d was partially shot here. While visiting Mirabell gardens, you\u2019ll relive the scene of Maria and the Von Trapp kids dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, jumping up and down the steps, as well as running through the hedge maze tunnel, all the while admiring the breathtaking view of Hohensalzburg Fortress in the distance. This film location spot, which can be visited for free, should not be missed. Situated in the center of Salzburg old town is Residence Square (German: Residenzplatz), which is home to the largest (45 feet tall) baroque fountain outside of Italy. It is in this square while singing \u201cI Have Confidence in Me\u201d, that Maria happily splashes water in the fountain, The Nazi soliders also march through the square later in the movie and hang their flag over the entrance of the old Residence Palace. Built in the 17th century to wash the horses of the prince-archbishop, the Horse Pond (German: Pferdeschwemme) was briefly featured in the movie as a backdrop to Maria and the kids singing \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d while dancing in their clothes made from curtains. In addition to being featured in the musical, the Horse Pond is well worth a visit in its own right. It is situation below the cliff side of M\u00f6nchsberg, and the bright fresco behind the horse pond makes for a gorgeous picture to add to your Sound of Music tour album. Carved into the M\u00f6nchsberg, the Rock Riding School (German: Felsenreitschule) was initially built to be a cathedral, but was later repurposed by the archbishop into a riding school where tournaments were held. Today it\u2019s Salzburg\u2019s most popular concert venue and is where the real Von Trapp family won the Sal\n\nquestion: Which location was used for the lakeside terrace scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Leopoldskron Palace", "usage": 1069}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Fans will recognize this Sound of Music filming location from the scene where the Captain sings \u201cEdelweiss\u201d and his family joins him on stage to sing \u201cSo Long, Farewell\u201d. Frohnburg Palace played an important role in the Sound of Music as it was one of the two filming locations for the Von Trapp Villa. Once a private residence, the palace is now a Music Academy, the facade and large iron gate is where Maria first set her eyes on the Von Trapp family home towards the end of the song \u201cI Have Confidence\u201d. The Palace was also featured in the movie during the scenes in which the Captain rips the Nazi flag from above the doorway and during the family\u2019s attempt to escape from the Nazis by pushing their car silently out of the gate. Just outside the city center is Hellbrunn Palace, home to the Sound of Music gazebo. It was here that the most romantic scenes of the Sound of Music was captured; when Liesl gets her first kiss while singing \u201c16 going on 17.\u201d It is also where the Captain and Maria fall deeper in love with each other while singing \u201cSomething Good\u201d. Though visitors cannot go into the gazebo, they can dance, sing, and take as many pictures as they please around it. Make your visit to Hellbrunn even more exciting by taking a tour of the Trick Fountains at Hellbrunn Palace. The hour long tour takes you through grottoes, ponds, and walkways filled with trick fountains. Your ticket also lets you explore the inside of the palace. This is one of the best things to do in Salzburg and will be a memorable experience especially for the kids. Leopoldskron Palace is one of the most important filming location for the Sound of Music as the majestic palace and perfect lake view backdrop served as the primary filming location for all of the lake terrace scenes of the Von Trapp family home. This includes the scenes in which Maria and the kids fall off the boat into the lake, and when the Captain and Uncle Max are drinking pink lemonade on the terrace. Though the interior of the mansion was never filmed in the movie, the palace\u2019s gold Venetian ballroom and foyer were rebuilt in Hollywood for the interior scenes. Today the palace is a boutique hotel. Staying overnight is the only way to visit the film location up close and to get a peek into the Venetian ballroom. Staying here is the ultimate Sound of Music experience as you get to live in the home of the Von Trapp family in the film. You can book your stay at Leopoldskron Palace here. If you choose not to stay at the hotel, you can still view the Palace at a distance from the west side of the lake. Though not a filming location, the Von Trapp Villa is where the real Von Trapp family lived for 15 years. They managed to get onto a train at the nearby station to escape the Nazis one day before the Austrian borders were closed. Today the Von Trapp Villa operates as a hotel and an educational Sound of Music museum of the real Von Trapp family as well as behind the scenes information about the filming of the movie. Not far from Leopoldskron Palace, a visit to the Von Trapp Villa would give fans a true insight on the life of the legendary Von Trapp family that we have come to love. Fans can either book a stay at the Villa or simply visit on a guided tour which takes place every day and lasts about 45 minutes. Mt. Untersberg is depicted twice in the Sound of Music, once during the opening scene in which Maria is singing the \u201cSound of Music\u201d and again when the family is escaping over the mountain to Switzerland while singing \u201cClimb Every Mountain\u201d. Fans can easily access Mount Untersberg from Salzburg via bus and get to the top via cable car. More adventurous travelers can hike 2 hours to the top. At 1,853 meters above the Salzburg basin, Mt. Untersberg offers breaktaking views over the region and is worth the day trip from Salzburg. Less than an hour bus drive from Salzburg is the picturesque lakeside town Mondsee. There you can visit the beautiful Collegiate Church of St. Michael where Maria and Georg von Trapp got married in the movie. This is a must-see for any Sound of Music fan. Make a full-day trip out of the location and stroll through the town, take a refreshing dip in the lake, hike up the nearby forest, and eat delicious seafood along the lake. In the opening scene of the movie you get a gorgeous aerial view of the village of St. Gilgen and the popular lake, Wolfgangsee. The village and lake can easily be reached by train.

The short 1.4km hike from the Werfen town takes about half an hour to complete. Once at the top you can enjoy a picnic and breathtaking views of the surrounding areas and the Hohenwerfen Fortress. Make your trip to Werfen a full day adventure by visiting both the Hohenwerfen Fortress and the largest ice cave in the world, Eisriesenwelt. Both sights will be a welcome addition to your Salzburg itinerary. Situated just across the German border, atop the magnificent Rossfeld mountain, is the Rossfeld Panoramic Road which was used in the movie to show the safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain. The private road, Rossfeld Panoramic Road is the only filming location that\u2019s difficult to get to without a car. If you don\u2019t have a car, it is recommended to visit the nearby Untersberg Mountain to get just as spectacular views with easier accessibility. Well there you have it, the top must-visit Sound of Music filming location in and around Salzburg. All locations can be visited on your own, but if you don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle or you have limited time, consider taking a guided Sound of Music tour from Salzburg or Vienna. And to make your Sound of Music trip even more memorable, spend a night or two at the home of the Von Trapp family in the film; Hotel Schloss Leopoldskron, or in the home of the real Von Trapp family at Villa Trapp. Either one will take your trip from amazing to extraordinary. Waseem says 1 month ago The Sound of Music gazebo at Hellbrunn Palace in Salzburg was moved here from its original location at Schloss Leopoldskron. Allan Trivette says 5 months ago The writer/compiler of this page shows an obvious love for the film. I was put under a \u201cSound of Music\u201d spell at the age of 10 when the film first came out, and I\u2019m still spellbound to this day. I\u2019ve visited Salzburg 5 times, and I can\u2019t wait to go back again. But, there are a few errors on this page that need to be clarified and/or corrected. First \u2013 #7 Frohnburg Palace \u2013 the writer of this article is correct \u2013 it WAS used as the von Trapp home in the film. However, what we see in the film as the FRONT of the von Trapp home is actually the BACK of Frohnburg! The FRONT of Frohnburg was used as the BACK of the von Trapp home in the film! The back of the home is seen when Rolf comes to deliver a telegram and the Captain takes it abruptly and tells him to leave. You see it also when the pink lemonade is served. Now, to make this even more complicated, the back of the film home looking toward the lake: the canoe flipping, the Baroness and the Captain strolling by the lake, Leisl running out to meet Rolf, Maria\u2019s return when she comes back from the Abbey, etc., is located to the left of Schloss Leopoldskron. I\u2019ll write more about this below. #8 \u2013 Hellbrun Palace (the gazebo) \u2013 correction \u2013 NONE of the gazebo scenes (\u201c16 Going on 17\u201d and \u201cSomething Good\u201d) were shot anywhere near the gazebo. It was a set in Hollywood. The only time we see the gazebo that is at Hellbrun is when the Captain and the Baroness take their stroll by the lake (just before the canoe flipping). It can be seen briefly in the background during their stroll. #9 \u2013 Leopoldskron Palace \u2013 was NOT used at ALL at any time during the filming!! The production company DID want to film the lake scenes there, but the officials of the Palace at that time wanted too much money. They did, however, offer the company the use of the \u201cside lawn\u201d. If you look at the photo of the Palace on this page, the side lawn is not seen, but it is to the left of the photo\u2019s edge. The \u201cOfficial Sound of Music Tour\u201d guides will show you the Schloss and point out the original horse-headed statues and lake gate and tell you that is where those scenes were filmed. WRONG!!! The \u201clake-gate\u201d and the horse-headed fish statues, were recreated by 20th Century-Fox and erected on the \u201cside lawn\u201d where the Meierhof is now located. The Meierhof used to be the administrative offices for the Palace, but it\n\nquestion: Which location was used for the lakeside terrace scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1054}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If one enters the main gate for the Schloss, the Schloss is to the left and the Meierhof is to the right. Walking straight from the gate to the lake one will see the pedestals for the horse-headed statues are still there. As was stated by the writer, the Venetian Room is in the Schloss and was used as the inspiration for the ballroom in the film. #11 \u2013 Mount Untersberg \u2013 clarification \u2013 the mount is seen several times in the background of several scenes, but NO SCENES were filmed ON it. #15 \u2013 Rossfeld Mountain \u2013 clarification \u2013 again, \u201cthe safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain\u201d is inaccurate. That \u201cescape\u201d scene was filmed just off the Rossfeld Panoramastrasse. There is a roadside cafe/restaurant on the Panoramastrasse called the Ahornkaser (they serve the best Apple Strudel you\u2019ll ever have). Standing in front of the Ahornkaser, there is a path on the right side of the building. Take that path about 400 feet and look up to your right. At the top of the hill is the exact spot where the von Trapps cross the mountain to freedom as \u201cClimb Ev\u2019ry Mountain\u201d is sung. At the end of that scene, with that open vista lying before them, you can see the Untersberg in the distance. I hope this helps/informs anyone planning on making a visit. Negar Modgeddi says 1 month ago I LOVE your notations about the actual places and your very thoughtful corrections! Melanie says 6 months ago Thank you for this great information! Do you know which field Maria was walking in during the opening scene? I know it was Untersberg Mountain in the background, but I can\u2019t find any information on the field she was frolicking through to get that sweeping view. Any pointers you can offer would be most appreciated! Ben says 6 months ago The opening scene was filmed on Mehlweg meadow which is not open to the public.

The opening aerial shots are Salzburg\u2019s glorious Lake District, the Salzkammergut. The castles you can see are Kloster H\u00f6glw\u00f6rth, an old monastery on a peninsula in H\u00f6glw\u00f6rther See; and Schloss Anif, off E55 a few miles south of Salzburg. The mountain, atop which Maria (Julie Andrews) makes her first twirling appearance, is Mehlweg, near the Bavarian village of Markt Schellenberg, about six miles from Salzburg. Don\u2019t be too disappointed \u2013 the birch trees and the babbling brook were added for the movie. Convent interiors were recreated in the studio, but the exterior really is Maria\u2019s abbey. It\u2019s Nonnberg Abbey, Nonnberg Gasse, where you can visit the courtyard and peek inside the chapel (which looks nothing like the interior recreated back in Hollywood). The film cheats a little with the exterior, too. As you\u2019ll find if you visit, the real Nonnberg Abbey doesn\u2019t look out over the picturesque old town of Salzburg, but to the nondescript southern suburbs. The reverse shot, of Maria leaving the abbey, filmed way across the city on the Humboldt Terrace (seen later in the Do Re Mi number), in front of the Museum of Modern Art, which since 2002 has stood atop M\u00f6nchsberg Cliffs on the site of the old Cafe Winkler. As Maria leaves to take up her post with the Von Trapp family, I Have Confidence in Me was filmed in Salzburg\u2019s Old Town, in the Residenzplatz, where you\u2019ll see the Domplatz arches, through which Maria enters, and the Residenz Fountain, in which she splashes. The \u2018Villa Von Trapp\u2019 is a combination of two different Salzburg locations. The tree-shaded lane, where Maria alights from the bus, is Hellbrunner Allee, running south from the old town. Here you\u2019ll recognise Schloss Frohnburg, a 17th century country house, now the Mozarteum Music Academy, which was used for the intimidating gates and front entrance of the villa which Maria nervously approaches. The lakeside terrace, though, was filmed at Schloss Leopoldskron, a rococo castle on Leopoldskroner Teich, a small artificial lake on the southwest of the town. You can view Leopoldskron across the lake from K\u00f6nig Ludwig Strasse, but it's now \u2013 hurrah! \u2013 a hotel. Leopoldskron's extravagantly gilt Venetian Room was replicated in the studio in Hollywood. Incidentally, the famous gazebo originally stood on the palace's grounds, when it was a private villa, but was moved to a more accessible location. The real Villa Trapp, by the way, is in Aigen, a suburb just to the southeast of the Old Town of Salzburg. Since 2008, it\u2019s been open as a hotel, Villa Trapp, Traunstra\u00dfe 34, 5026 Salzburg. There\u2019s a rail service to Bahnhof Aigen. The little footbridge over which the von Trapps skip at the beginning of the My Favourite Things montage of Salzburg is Mozart Steg, north of Mozart Platz. They quickly move on to Domplatz, in front of Salzburger Dom (Salzburg Cathedral); Kapitelschwemme, the Baroque horse pond once used for watering and cleaning horses, in Herbert von Karajan Platz; and the market on Kajetanerplatz, just north of Nonnberg Abbey, where Maria demonstrates her tomato juggling skills. They finally head off for a picnic in the meadow above the village of Werfen, 25 miles south of Salzburg in the Salzach River valley (where you can also visit the castle from wartime action movie Where Eagles Dare). Do-Re-Mi begins at the picnic, returning to Salzburg atop the Monchsberg Cliffs, on Humboldt Terrace which you can reach from the Monchsberg elevator in Anton Neumayrplatz, at the end of the Gstattengasse shopping street, and continuing with a carriage ride south from St Erhard Kirche, the Parish Church of St Erhard, along Nonntaler Hauptstra\u00dfe,\n\nquestion: Which location was used for the lakeside terrace scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Schloss Leopoldskron", "usage": 1044}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The number climaxes at Mirabell Gardens, on Schwarzstrasse, over the Salzach River behind Schloss Mirabell, where you\u2019ll find the fountains, statues and, famously, the flight of steps on which the children hop. The Von Trapp gazebo, used for Sixteen Going On Seventeen, once stood in the grounds of Leopoldskron, but constant trespassing resulted in it being moved and reconstructed in the ornamental gardens of Schloss Hellbrunn, Morzger Strasse, toward the south of Salzburg. And another cheat. It was recreated, slightly larger, back at 20th Century-Fox in Hollywood for the interior shots. Maria\u2019s wedding, which took place in Nonnberg Abbey, was filmed in the baroque, twin-towered St Michael\u2019s Church, Wredeplatz, in Mondsee, about 15 miles east of Salzburg on the E55/E60. The Anschluss scene, Austria\u2019s enforced unity with Nazi Germany, was staged back in the centre of Salzburg itself in Residenzplatz. The music festival, at which the von Trapp family perform their disappearing act, is at the Felsenreitschule (\u2018Rock Riding School\u2019), Hofstallgasse 1, a 1400-seat theatre built in what was a rock quarry for Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun in 1693, and used as the archbishop's riding school. It\u2019s one of the sites of the Salzburg Festival. Despite what some overenthusiastic tour guides might tell you, the cemetery in which the von Trapps hide from the Nazis is a Hollywood studio set, though its design is clearly based on St Peter\u2019s Graveyard, which you can see just off Kapitelplatz. The mountain over which the family finally escapes to freedom is above the village of Obersalzburg with views of the Untersberg in the distance, near the village of Rossfeld, on the 319, 12 miles south of Salzburg. \u2022 Many thanks to Lieselotte Mayrhofer; and to Bryan Crawford of Edelweiss Tours for help with this section.

Adapted from the 1959 stage musical of the same name, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is actually based on the memoir, titled \u2018The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u2019. The story deals with a postulant, who goes to the imposing home of a retired naval officer. The man is a widower, and the young woman acts as a governess to his children. Soon enough, she brings music and love to the entire family, and it is not long before she falls in love with her employer as well. Together they band, as they have to face the loss of their motherland to the Nazis. If you have seen the movie, you already know that it takes place in Salzburg in Austria. Over the course of the film, there are several iconic scenes that have been shot at picturesque locations, or there are some locations that have been simply elevated due to the value of the scene itself (think of the gazebo where \u2018Sixteen Going on Seventeen\u2019 is performed). Naturally, you might be wondering about the exact filming locations of this popular movie, and we have got you covered in that regard. When \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 started filming, the crew did not head immediately to the real locations for the movie. Instead, when principal photography began on March 26, 1964, it started at the 20th Century Fox studios located in Los Angeles. Following this, the crew headed to Salzburg, where they filmed at a variety of locations including the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and Residence Fountain, among others. Filming commenced here from April 23, to around May 22. Various other locations nearby were used, and shooting went on till around June 19. The crew also hit up places nearby including Werfen in the Salzach River valley. Some scenes were also shot in Bavaria, with the Alps serving as a wonderful backdrop. Around July 6, the team headed back to Los Angeles for the remaining scenes, and principal photography ultimately wrapped up by September 1, 1964. As is evident, a plethora of locations have been hit in this frenzied shooting schedule, and we now proceed to the specific filming locations, rendered memorable by the iconic scenes that have unfolded there. Salzburg in Austria serves as the place where most of the pivotal scenes of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place. Some of the most recognizable locations include Mirabell Palace and Gardens. If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you must know that \u2018Do re mi\u2019 is one of the most popular songs. The ending of this song sees Maria and the von Trapp kids at the Mirabell Palace and Gardens. Located in Salzburg\u2019s old town, we can see the movie characters dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, which is located in front of the palace. The other recognizable locations happen to be the rose garden at the north of the fountain and the Greek fencing statues at the entrance. Residenzplatz Square and Fountain also plays an important part, early on, as Maria can be seen splashing in the baroque horse fountain here, while \u2018I Have Confidence in Me\u2019 is playing. When Germany annexes Austria, we see Nazi soldiers marching through this square, while a Swastika flag is raised above the Old Residence Palace\u2019s entrance. The Summer Riding School (Felsenreitschule) is where the von Trapp family takes the stage, performing \u2018Edelweiss\u2019 and \u2018So long, Farewell\u2019, for the Folk Festival. Notably, hundreds of extras were hired for the scene to sing along. A little away from this location, on Herbert von Karajan Square, is the Horse Pond, where Maria and the children dance at the end of \u2018My Favorite Things\u2019. Leopoldskron Palace is important in its own way since all the lake terrace scenes of the von Trapp family home were shot here. Schloss Frohnburg was also used to show the von Trapp house, rather the intimidating front gates which Maria nervously approaches initially. Nonnberg Abbey Convent is where Maria lived, and the exteriors of the same have been used in the movie. However, the movie has taken some liberties here, as the convent does not actually look over the old town of Salzburg, but instead has a view of the nondescript southern suburbs. St. Michael Basilica in Mondsee, outside Salzburg, is remarkable because Maria gets married to Georg von Trapp, in one of the most famous scenes from the movie. Werfen, which is around a 40-minute drive away from Salzburg, has the Gschwandtanger Meadow, which\n\nquestion: Which location was used for the lakeside terrace scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Leopoldskron Palace", "usage": 1086}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Bavaria is important for being one of the first scenes where Maria makes her entrance. She can be seen twirling at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg. The sequence where the von Trapps escape the Nazis is also shot on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. Notably, Stage 8 and Stage 15 were used in the studios, but a lot of important scenes were shot there. Firstly, shooting inside the convent was not allowed, meaning that the set was created in the studio itself. The golden foyer and the ballroom, we see in the house, were also recreated in Hollywood. There is an important scene where the Von Trapp family hides from the Nazis behind some tombs. While the scenes have been recreated in Hollywood, they closely resemble St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery and Catacombs in Salzburg. The gazebo where two of the finest songs in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place, that is, \u2018Something Good\u2019 and \u201916 going on 17\u2032, is actually both a real-life location as well as something created in a studio. The real-life gazebo is near the Eastern entrance to the Hellbrunn Palace. A larger one was rebuilt in Hollywood where most of the scenes were actually shot. As is evident, the scenes in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 have been carefully shot to capture the beauty of the location and to transport us into this enchanting world inhabited by the von Trapp family and Maria. Making the best use of the locations is just one small aspect that has helped this film go down in history as one of the most memorable examples of great cinema.

The film is an adaptation of the 1959 stage musical, composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and a book by Lindsay and Crouse. Based on the 1949 memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria von Trapp, the film is set in Salzburg, Austria and is a fictional retelling of her experiences as governess to seven children, her eventual marriage with their father Captain Georg Von Trapp, and their escape during the Anschluss in 1938. Filming took place from March to September 1964 in Los Angeles and Salzburg. The Sound of Music was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited roadshow theatrical release. Although initial critical response to the film was mixed, it was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office film after four weeks, and the highest-grossing film of 1965. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all-time\u2014surpassing Gone with the Wind\u2014and held that distinction for five years. The film was just as popular throughout the world, breaking previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries. Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years, and two successful re-releases, the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286 million. The Sound of Music received five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Wise's second pair of both awards, the first being from the 1961 film West Side Story. The film also received two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture and Best Actress, the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. In 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) listed The Sound of Music as the fifty-fifth greatest American film of all time, and the fourth-greatest film musical. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg in 1938. Her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern. Mother Abbess sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children\u2014Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children out of drapes that are to be changed. She takes them around Salzburg and the mountains while teaching them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake which concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain attempts to fire Maria. However, he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. The Captain apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay. Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes that he enters them in the upcoming Salzburg Festival, but the Captain disapproves of letting his children sing in public. During a grand party at the villa, where guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional L\u00e4ndler folk dance, he steps in and partners Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy by indirectly convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. However, Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, so she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her purpose in life. When Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. However, the Baroness learns that the Captain's feelings\n\nquestion: Which location was used for the lakeside terrace scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Salzburg", "usage": 1122}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

While the couple is on their honeymoon, Max enters the children into the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. Having learned that Austria has been annexed by the Third Reich, the couple return to their home, where the Captain receives a telegram, ordering him to report to the German Naval base at Bremerhaven to accept a commission in the Kriegsmarine. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and their ideology, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. That night, the von Trapp family attempt to flee to Switzerland, but they are stopped by a group of Brownshirts, led by the Gauleiter Hans Zeller, waiting outside the villa. To cover his family's tracks, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven. Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slips away and seeks shelter at the abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Zeller and his men soon arrive and search the abbey, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When they attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start, as two of the nuns have sabotaged their engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom. The real Maria von Trapp has a brief uncredited cameo as a passerby, alongside her children Rosmarie and Werner von Trapp during \"I Have Confidence\". The Sound of Music story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, published in 1949 to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband Georg in 1947. Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told. In 1956, German producer Wolfgang Liebeneiner purchased the film rights for $9,000 (equivalent to $97,000 in 2022), hired George Hurdalek and Herbert Reinecker to write the screenplay, and Franz Grothe to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional Austrian folk songs. The Trapp Family was released in West Germany on October 9, 1956, and became a major success. Two years later, Liebeneiner directed a sequel, The Trapp Family in America, and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years. Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America. In 1956, Paramount Pictures purchased the United States film rights, intending to produce an English-language version with Audrey Hepburn as Maria. The studio eventually dropped its option, but one of its directors, Vincent J. Donehue, proposed the story as a stage musical for Mary Martin. Producers Richard Halliday and Leland Heyward secured the rights and hired playwrights Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, who had won the Pulitzer Prize for State of the Union. They approached Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II to compose one song for the musical, but the composers felt the two styles\u2014traditional Austrian folk songs and their composition\u2014would not work together. They offered to write a completely new score for the entire production if the producers were willing to wait while they completed work on Flower Drum Song. The producers quickly responded that they would wait as long as necessary. The Sound of Music stage musical opened on November 16, 1959, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York City and ran on Broadway for 1,443 performances, winning six Tony Awards, including Best Musical. In June 1960, Twentieth Century-Fox purchased the film adaptation rights to the stage musical for $1.25 million (equivalent to $12,400,000 in 2022) against ten percent of the gross. In December 1962, 20th Century-Fox president Richard D. Zanuck hired Ernest Lehman to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of the stage musical. Lehman reviewed the original script for the stage musical, rearranged the sequence of songs, and began transforming a work designed for the stage into a film that could use the camera to emphasize action and mood and open the story up to the beautiful locations of Salzburg and the Austrian Alps. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" sequence in the play, for example, was originally a stagnant number; Lehman transformed it into a lively montage showing some of the beautiful sites of Salzburg, as well as showing Maria and the children growing closer over time. Lehman also eliminated two songs, \"How Can Love Survive?\" and \"No Way to Stop It\", sung by the characters of Elsa and Max. In January 1963, he saw the Fox English-d\n\nquestion: Which location was used for the lakeside terrace scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Austria", "usage": 1130}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material. While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director. Their first choice was Robert Wise, with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of West Side Story, but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, The Sand Pebbles. Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including Stanley Donen, Vincent J. Donehue, George Roy Hill, and Gene Kelly. In January 1963, Lehman invited one of his favorite directors, William Wyler, to travel to New York City with him to see the Broadway musical. After seeing the show, Wyler said he hated it, but after two weeks of Lehman's persuasion, Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film. After hiring musical supervisor Roger Edens, Wyler, Lehman, and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations. In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy-five locations\u2014an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences. During that trip, Lehman began to have reservations about Wyler's commitment to the project and communicated this to Zanuck, who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible. Lehman completed the first draft on September 10, 1963, and sent it to Wyler, who had no suggestions or changes to add. At that time, Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise, whom Lehman still wanted as the director. Later that month, Wyler's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct The Collector. Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film, and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director, ending Wyler's participation. Meanwhile, Wise, whose film The Sand Pebbles had been postponed, read Lehman's first draft, was impressed by what he read, and agreed to direct the film, joining the picture in October 1963, and flew to Salzburg with associate producer Saul Chaplin and members of his production team to scout filming locations, including many that Wyler had identified. When he returned, Wise began working on the script. Wise shared Lehman's vision of the film being centered on the music, and the changes he made were consistent with the writer's approach\u2014mainly reducing the amount of sweetness and sentimentality found in the stage musical. He had reservations about Lehman's opening aerial sequence because West Side Story, whose screenplay Lehman had also written, had used a similar opening sequence, but he was unable to think of a better one and decided to keep Lehman's. Other changes included replacing \"An Ordinary Couple\" with a more romantic number, and a new song for Maria's departure from the abbey\u2014Rodgers provided \"Something Good\" and \"I Have Confidence\", especially for the film. Lehman completed the second draft on December 20, 1963, but additional changes would be made based on input from Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer about the character of the Captain. Plummer especially helped change a character lacking substance into a stronger, more forceful complex figure with a wry sense of humor and a darker edge. Lehman completed his final draft on March 20, 1964. Lehman's first and only choice for Maria was Julie Andrews. When Wise joined the project, he made a list of his choices for the role, which included Andrews as his first choice, Grace Kelly, and Shirley Jones. Wise and Lehman went to Disney Studios to view footage from Mary Poppins, which was not yet released. A few minutes into the film, Wise told Lehman, \"Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this film and grabs her!\" Andrews had some reservations\u2014mainly about the amount of sweetness in the theatrical version\u2014but when she learned that her concerns were shared by Wise and Lehman and what their vision was, she signed a contract with Fox to star in The Sound of Music and one other film for $225,000 (equivalent to $2,120,000 in 2022). Wise had a more difficult time casting the role of the Captain. A number of actors were considered for the part, including Bing Crosby, Yul Brynner, Sean Connery, and Richard Burton. Wise had seen Christopher Plummer on Broadway and wanted him for the role, but the stage actor turned down the offer several times. Wise flew to London to meet with Plummer and explained his concept of the film; the actor accepted after being assured that he could work with Lehman to improve the character. Wise also spent considerable time and effort on casting the secondary characters. For the role of Max Detweiler, Wise initially considered Victor Borge, No\u00ebl Coward, and Hal Holbrook among others before deciding on Richard Haydn. For the character of Baroness Elsa Schraeder\n\nquestion: Which location was used for the lakeside terrace scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Salzburg", "usage": 1124}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The casting of the children's characters began in November 1963 and involved over two hundred interviews and auditions throughout the United States and England. Some of the child actors interviewed or tested, who were not selected, included Mia Farrow, Patty Duke, Lesley Ann Warren, Geraldine Chaplin, Shelley Fabares, Teri Garr, Kurt Russell, and The Osmonds. Most of the actors selected had some acting, singing, or dancing experience. Charmian Carr, however, was a model who worked part-time in a doctor's office and had no ambition to pursue a career as an actress. After a friend sent her photo to Wise's office, she was asked to interview. Wise later recalled, \"She was so pretty and had such poise and charm that we liked her immediately.\" The last person to be cast was Daniel Truhitte in the role of Rolfe. Rehearsals for the singing and dance sequences began on February 10, 1964. The husband-and-wife team of Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, who had worked with Andrews on Mary Poppins, worked out the choreography with Saul Chaplin on piano\u2014the arrangements could not be altered under Rodgers and Hammerstein's contract. The stage choreography was not used because it was too restrictive. Breaux and Wood worked out all-new choreography better suited for the film that incorporated many of the Salzburg locations and settings. They even choreographed the newly added puppet dance sequence for \"The Lonely Goatherd\". The choreography for the L\u00e4ndler strictly followed the traditional Austrian folk dance. The musical arranger Irwin Kostal prerecorded the songs with a large orchestra and singers on a stage before the start of filming. In her book, The Sound of Music: The Making of America's Favorite Movie, Julia Antopol Hirsch says that Kostal used seven children and five adults to record the children's voices; the only scene in which the child-actors' singing is heard in the released version of the film is when they sing \"The Sound of Music\" on their own after Maria leaves. Charmian Carr refuted the claim that the voices of the child actors were dubbed in the film and on the soundtrack. Carr contended that all of the children who are in the film sing on the track, but four other children were added to most of the songs to give them a fuller sound; they did not replace them as singers. The voices of some of the adult actors had voice doubles, including those of Peggy Wood and Christopher Plummer. Principal photography began on March 26, 1964, at 20th Century-Fox studios in Los Angeles, where scenes from Maria's bedroom and the abbey cloister and graveyard were filmed. The company then flew to Salzburg, where filming resumed on April 23 at Mondsee Abbey for the wedding scenes. From April 25 through May 22, scenes were filmed at the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, Residence Fountain, and various street locations throughout the Altstadt (Old Town) area of the city. Wise faced opposition from city leaders who did not want him staging scenes with swastika banners. They relented after he threatened instead to include old newsreel footage featuring the banners. On days when it rained, a constant challenge for the company, Wise arranged for scenes to be shot at St. Margarethen Chapel and D\u00fcrer Studios (Reverend Mother's office). From May 23 to June 7, the company worked at Schloss Leopoldskron and an adjacent property called Bertelsmann for scenes representing the lakeside terrace and gardens of the von Trapp villa. From June 9 to 19, scenes were shot at Frohnburg Palace, which represented the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa. Karath could not swim and was in danger during the capsizing boat scene. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" picnic scene in the mountains was filmed above the town of Werfen in the Salzach River valley on June 25 and 27. The opening sequence of Maria on her mountain was filmed from June 28 to July 2 at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg in Bavaria. During filming, Birch trees were added and then removed. The brook she walks through was plastic filled with water which was put there during filming. The final scene of the von Trapp family escaping over the mountains was filmed on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. The cast and crew flew back to Los Angeles and resumed filming at Fox Studios on July 6 for all remaining scenes, including those in the villa dining room, ballroom, terrace, living room, and gazebo.

A total of eighty-three scenes were filmed in just over five months. Post-production work began on August 25 with three weeks of dialogue dubbing to correct lines that were ruined by various street noises and rain. In October, Christopher Plummer's singing voice was dubbed by veteran Disney playback singer Bill Lee. The film was then edited by Wise and film editor William Reynolds. Once the film was edited, Irwin Kostal, who orchestrated the musical numbers, underscored the film with background music consisting of variations on Rodgers and Hammerstein's original songs to amplify or add nuances to the visual images. When dubbing, editing, and scoring were complete, Wise arranged for two sneak-preview showings\u2014the first one held in Minneapolis on Friday, January 15, 1965 at the Mann Theater, and the second one held the following night in Tulsa. Despite the \"sensational\" responses from the preview audiences, Wise made a few final editing changes before completing the film. According to the original print information for the film, the running time for the theatrical release version was 174 minutes. The film was still in release when the Motion Picture Association of America's film ratings system was implemented in 1968, and was subsequently given a \"G\" rating (\"general audiences\") in 1969. The Sound of Music was filmed in Todd-AO by Ted McCord and produced with DeLuxe Color processing. Aerial footage was photographed with an MCS-70 camera. The sound was recorded on a 70 mm six-track using a Westrex recording system. The sets used for the film were based on the storyboards of sketch artist Maurice Zuberano, who accompanied Wise to Austria to scout filming locations in November 1963. Wise met with the artist over ten weeks and explained his objective for each scene\u2014the feeling he wanted to convey and the visual images he wanted to use. When Zuberano was finished, he provided Wise with a complete set of storyboards that illustrated each scene and set\u2014storyboards the director used as guidance during filming. Zuberano's storyboards and location photos were also used by art director Boris Leven to design and construct all of the original interior sets at Fox studios, as well as some external sets in Salzburg. The von Trapp villa, for example, was actually filmed in several locations: the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa were filmed at Frohnburg Palace, the lakeside terrace and gardens was a set constructed on a property adjacent to Schloss Leopoldskron called Bertelsmann, and the interior was a constructed set at Fox Studios. The gazebo scenes for \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" were filmed on a larger reconstructed set at Fox studios, while some shots of the original gazebo were filmed on the grounds at Schloss Leopoldskron in Salzburg. Most of the soundtrack to The Sound of Music was written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and arranged and conducted by Irwin Kostal, who also adapted the instrumental underscore passages. Both the lyrics and music for two new songs were written by Rodgers, as Hammerstein died in 1960. The soundtrack album was released by RCA Victor in 1965 and is one of the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 20 million copies worldwide. The album reached the number one position on the Billboard 200 that year in the United States. It remained in the top ten for 109 weeks, from May 1, 1965, to July 16, 1967, and remained on the Billboard 200 chart for 238 weeks. The album was the best-selling album in the United Kingdom in 1965, 1966, and 1968 and the second best-selling of the entire decade, spending a total of 70 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It also stayed 73 weeks on the Norwegian charts, becoming the seventh best-charting album of all time in that country. In 2015, Billboard named the album the second greatest album of all time. The album has been reissued several times, including anniversary editions with additional tracks in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Wise hired Mike Kaplan to direct the publicity campaign for the film. After reading the script, Kaplan decided on the ad line \"The Happiest Sound in All the World\", which would appear on promotional material and artwork. Kaplan also brought in outside agencies to work with the studio's advertising department to develop the promotional artwork, eventually selecting a painting by Howard Terpning of Andrews on an alpine meadow with her carpetbag and guitar case in hand with the children and Plummer in the background. In February 1964, Kaplan began placing ads in the trade papers Daily Variety, Weekly Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter to attract future exhibitor interest in the project. The studio intended the film to have an initial roadshow theatrical release in select large cities in theaters that could accommodate the 70-mm screenings and six-track stereophonic sound. The roadshow concept involved two show\n\nquestion: Which location was used for the lakeside terrace scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Bertelsmann", "usage": 1147}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Kaplan identified forty key cities that would likely be included in the roadshow release and developed a promotional strategy targeting the major newspapers of those cities. During the Salzburg production phase, 20th Century-Fox organized press junkets for American journalists to interview Wise and his team and the cast members. \"No one is comfortable with an excess of hearts and flowers, but there is no valid reason for hiding honest emotion. This has always been a major element in the theatre, and it's my conviction that anyone who can't, on occasion, be sentimental about children, home or nature is sadly maladjusted.\" Richard Rodgers The film had its opening premiere on March 2, 1965, at the Rivoli Theater in New York City. Initial reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's \"romantic nonsense and sentiment\", the children's \"artificial roles\", and Robert Wise's \"cosy-cum-corny\" direction. Judith Crist, in a biting review in the New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as \"icky sticky\" and designed for \"the five to seven set and their mommies\". In her review for McCall's magazine, Pauline Kael called the film \"the sugar-coated lie people seem to want to eat\", and that audiences have \"turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs.\" Wise later recalled, \"The East Coast, intellectual papers and magazines destroyed us, but the local papers and the trades gave us great reviews\". Indeed, reviewers such as Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \"three hours of visual and vocal brilliance\", and Variety called it \"a warmly-pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast\". The \"wildly mixed film reviews\" reflected the critical response to the stage musical, according to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical. After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10, The Sound of Music opened in 131 theaters in the United States, including a limited number of roadshow events. After four weeks, the film became the number one box office movie in the country and held that position for thirty out of the next forty-three weeks in 1965. The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years. A few months after its United States release, The Sound of Music opened in 261 theaters in other countries, the first American movie to be completely dubbed in a foreign language, both dialogue, and music. The German, French, Italian, and Spanish versions were completely dubbed, the Japanese version had Japanese dialogue with English songs, and other versions were released with foreign subtitles. The film was a popular success in every country it opened, except the two countries where the story originated, Austria and Germany. In these two countries, the film had to compete with the much-loved Die Trapp-Familie (1956), which provided the original inspiration for the Broadway musical, and its sequel Die Trapp-Familie in Amerika (1958); both films are still widely popular in German-speaking Europe and considered the authoritative von Trapp story. Austrians took exception to the liberties taken by the filmmakers with regard to the costumes, which did not reflect the traditional style and the replacement of traditional Austrian folk songs with Broadway show tunes. The film's Nazi theme was especially unpopular in Germany, where the Munich branch manager for 20th Century-Fox approved the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act of the film following the wedding sequence\u2014the scenes showing Salzburg following the Anschluss. Robert Wise and the studio intervened, the original film was restored, and the branch manager was fired. The Sound of Music holds an 84% \"Certified Fresh\" score on Rotten Tomatoes based on seventy-four reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's consensus states: \"Unapologetically sweet and maybe even a little corny, The Sound of Music will win over all but the most cynical filmgoers with its classic songs and irresistible warmth.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on eleven critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The Sound of Music is one of the most commercially successful films of all time. Four weeks after its theatrical release, it became the number one box office movie in the United States, from revenue generated by twenty-five theaters, each screening only ten roadshow performances per week. It held the number one position for thirty of the next forty-three weeks, and ended up the highest-grossing film of 1965. One contributing factor in the film's early commercial success was the repeat business of many filmgoers. In some cities in the United States, the number of tickets sold exceeded the total population.

Worldwide, The Sound of Music broke previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries, including the United Kingdom, where it played for a record-breaking three years at the Dominion Theatre in London and earned \u00a34 million in rentals and grossed \u00a36 million\u2014more than twice as much as any other film had taken in. It was also a major success in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, where it played for as long as two years at some theaters. It was not a universal success, however, with the film only enjoying modest success in France and it was a flop in Germany. It also initially performed poorly in Italy, but a re-release after the Oscars brought better results. It was number one at the US box office for a further 11 weeks in 1966, for a total of 41 weeks at number one. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all time, with over $67.5 million in worldwide rentals ($125 million in gross receipts), surpassing Gone with the Wind, which held that distinction for twenty-four years. It was still in the top ten at the US box office in its 100th week of release. The Sound of Music completed its initial four-and-a-half year theatrical release run in the United States on Labor Day 1969, the longest initial run for a film in the US, having earned $68,313,000 in rentals in the United States and Canada. It played for 142 weeks at the Eglinton Theatre in Toronto. It was the first film to gross over $100 million. By December 1970, it had earned $121.5 million in worldwide rentals, which was over four times higher than the film's estimated break-even point of $29.5 million in rentals. The film was re-released in 1973, and increased its North American rentals to $78.4 million. By the end of the 1970s, it was ranked seventh in all-time North American rentals, having earned $79 million. The film's re-release in 1990 increased the total North American admissions to 142,415,400\u2014the third-highest number of tickets sold behind Gone with the Wind and Star Wars\u2014and about 283.3 million admissions worldwide. The Sound of Music eventually earned a total domestic gross of $163,214,076 and a total worldwide gross of $286,214,076. Adjusted for inflation, the film earned about $2.366 billion at 2014 prices\u2014placing it among the top ten highest-grossing films of all time. The Sound of Music has been included in numerous top film lists from the American Film Institute. The first American television transmission of The Sound of Music was on February 29, 1976, on ABC, which paid $15 million (equivalent to $77,140,351 in 2022) for a one-time only broadcast that became one of the top 20 rated films shown on television to that point with a Nielsen rating of 33.6 and an audience share of 49%. The movie was not shown again until NBC acquired the broadcast rights in June 1977 for $21.5 million for 20 showings over 22 years and telecast the film on February 11, 1979. NBC continued to air the film annually for twenty years. During most of its run on NBC, the film was heavily edited to fit a three-hour time slot\u2014approximately 140 minutes without commercials, which inevitably cut 30 minutes out of the original film. The film aired in its uncut form (minus the entr'acte) on April 9, 1995, on NBC. Julie Andrews hosted the four-hour telecast which presented the musical numbers in a letterboxed format. As the film's home video availability cut into its television ratings, NBC let their contract lapse in 2001. That year, the film was broadcast one time on the Fox network, in its heavily edited 140-minute version. Since 2002, the film has aired on ABC on a Sunday night prior to Christmas and has been broadcast on its sister cable network, Freeform, periodically around Easter and other holidays. Most of its more recent runs have been the full version in a four-hour time slot, complete with the entr'acte. ABC first broadcast a high-definition version on December 28, 2008. On December 22, 2013, the annual broadcast had its highest ratings since 2007; the increase in ratings were credited to NBC's broadcast of The Sound of Music Live!\u2014a live television adaptation of the original musical which aired earlier that month. In the United Kingdom, the film rights were acquired by the BBC, who paid a corporation record $4.1 million, and it was first aired on BBC One on 25 December 1978 and, as of December 2016, fifteen times since, mostly around Christmas time.

The film was also intended to be part of the BBC's programming during the outbreak of nuclear war. The film has been released on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD numerous times. The first DVD version was released on August 29, 2000, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the film's release. The film is often included in box sets with other Rodgers & Hammerstein film adaptations. A 40th anniversary DVD, with \"making of\" documentaries and special features, was released on November 15, 2005. The film made its debut issue on Blu-ray Disc on November 2, 2010, for its 45th anniversary. For the Blu-ray release, the original 70 mm negatives were rescanned at 8K resolution, then restored and remastered at 4K resolution for the transfer to Blu-ray, giving the most detailed copy of the film seen thus far. On March 10, 2015, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released The Sound of Music 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition\u2014a five-disc set featuring thirteen hours of bonus features, including a new documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg. A March 2015 episode of ABC's 20/20 entitled The Untold Story of the Sound of Music featured a preview of the documentary and interviews by Diane Sawyer. In part to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, the film was made available on the Disney+ streaming service upon its debut on November 12, 2019. The Sound of Music film adaptation, like the stage musical, presents a history of the von Trapp family (a.k.a. the Trapp Family) that is not completely accurate. The musical was based on the West German film The Trapp Family (1956) rather than Maria von Trapp's 1949 memoirs, as director Vincent J. Donehue had seen the film and decided that it would make a good vehicle for Mary Martin. The musical followed the film's plot so closely that the New York Times review of the West German film noticed that it \"strongly suggests 'The Sound of Music,' often scene by scene.\" The West German screenwriters made several significant changes to the family's story that were kept in the musical. Maria had been hired to teach just one child, but the 1956 film made her governess to all seven children. The 1965 film adaptation was influenced by other musicals of its era, such as Mary Poppins, the Rodgers and Hammerstein television production of Cinderella, and the stage production of Lerner and Loewe's Camelot (coincidentally all starring Julie Andrews). Screenwriter Ernest Lehman was inspired by the opening of West Side Story and saw the musical as \"a fairy tale that's almost real\". The film incorporated many \"fairy tale\" tropes which included the idyllic imagery (placed in the hills of Salzburg), the European villas, and the cross-class Cinderella-like romance between Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As Maria walks down the aisle to be married, the pageantry is explicitly both Guinevere and Cinderella. In keeping with this tone the filmmakers used artistic license to convey the essence and meaning of their story. Georg Ludwig von Trapp was indeed an anti-Nazi opposed to the Anschluss, and lived with his family in a villa in a district of Salzburg called Aigen. Their lifestyle depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living. The actual family villa, located at Traunstra\u00dfe 34, Aigen 5026, was large and comfortable but not nearly as grand as the mansion depicted in the film. The house was also not their ancestral home, as depicted in the film. The family had previously lived in homes in Zell Am See and Klosterneuburg after being forced to abandon their actual ancestral home in Pola following World War I. Georg moved the family to the Salzburg villa shortly after the death of his first wife, Agathe Whitehead, in 1922. Georg is referred to as \"Captain\" in the film, but he held a noble title of \"Ritter\" (hereditary knight), which had higher social status than a naval officer. Although Austrian nobility was legally abolished in 1919 and the nobiliary particle von was proscribed, both continued to be widely used unofficially as a matter of social courtesy. Georg was offered a position in the German Kriegsmarine; Nazi Germany was looking to expand its fleet of U-boats, and Corvette Captain von Trapp was the most successful Austro-Hungarian submarine commander of World War I, having sunk 11 Allied merchant ships totaling 47,653 GRT and two Allied warships displacing a total of 12,641 tons. With his family in desperate financial straits, he seriously considered the offer before deciding he could not serve a Nazi regime. In the film, Georg is depicted initially as a humorless, emotionally distant father. In reality, third child Maria Franziska von Trapp (\n\nquestion: Which location was used for the lakeside terrace scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "A 40th anniversary DVD, with \"making of\" documentaries and special features, was released on November 15, 2005.", "usage": 1168}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She has a different recollection of her stepmother, Maria Augusta Kutschera, whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage. In a 2003 interview, Maria remembered, \" had a terrible temper... and from one moment to the next, you didn't know what hit her. We were not used to this. But we took it like a thunderstorm that would pass, because the next minute she could be very nice.\" Maria Kutschera had indeed been a novice at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and had been hired by the von Trapp family. However, she was hired only to be a tutor to young Maria Franziska, who had come down with scarlet fever and needed her lessons at home, not to be a governess for all of the children. Maria and Georg married for practical reasons, rather than love and affection for each other. Georg needed a mother for his children, and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey. \"I really and truly was not in love,\" Maria wrote in her memoir, \"I liked him but didn't love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children. I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after.\" They were married in 1927, not in 1938 as depicted in the film, and the couple had been married for over a decade by the time of the Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time. Maria and Georg enjoyed a happy marriage. The von Trapp family lost most of its wealth during the worldwide depression of the early 1930s, when the Austrian national bank folded. In order to survive, the family dismissed the servants and began taking in boarders. They also started singing onstage to earn money, a fact that caused the proud Georg much embarrassment. In the film, the von Trapp family hike over the Alps from Austria to Switzerland to escape the Nazis, which would not have been possible; Salzburg is over two hundred miles from Switzerland. The von Trapp villa, however, was only a few kilometers from the Austria\u2013Germany border, and the final scene shows the family hiking on the Obersalzberg near the German town of Berchtesgaden, within sight of Adolf Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus Eagle's Nest retreat. In reality, the family simply walked to the local train station and boarded a train to Italy. The Trapps were entitled to Italian citizenship since Georg had been born in Zadar, Dalmatia, Austria-Hungary, which had been annexed by Italy after World War I. They were able to emigrate to the United States via the United Kingdom on their Italian passports. The fictional character Max Detweiler, who acted as the scheming family music director in the film, is based on the von Trapps' family priest, the Reverend Franz Wasner, who was their musical director for over twenty years and, unlike Max, accompanied them when they left Austria. The character of Friedrich, the second oldest child in the film version, was based on Rupert, the oldest of the real von Trapp children. Liesl, the oldest child in the film, was based on Agathe von Trapp, the second oldest in the real family. The names and ages of the children were changed, in part because the third child, who would be portrayed as \"Louisa\", was also named Maria, and producers thought that it would be confusing to have two characters called Maria in the film. The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers. Robert Wise met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to Richard Zanuck, that he was not making a \"documentary or realistic movie\" about her family, and that he would make the film with \"complete dramatic freedom\" in order to produce a \"fine and moving film\", one they could all be proud of. Although The Sound of Music is set in Salzburg, it was largely ignored in Austria upon release. The film adaptation was a blockbuster worldwide, but it ran for only three days in Salzburg movie theaters, with locals showing \"disdain\" for a film that \"wasn't authentic.\" In 1966, American Express created the first Sound of Music guided tour in Salzburg. Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been the leading Sound of Music bus tour company in the city, taking approximately 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region.

A German translation of the musical was performed on the national stage for the first time in 2005 at the Vienna Volksoper, receiving negative reviews from Austrian critics, who called it \"boring\" and referred to \"Edelweiss\" as \"an insult to Austrian musical creation.\" The musical finally premiered in Salzburg in 2011 at the Salzburger Landestheater, but Maria was played in the Salzburg premiere by a Dutch actress who \"grew up with the songs.\" However, most performances in Vienna and Salzburg were sold out, and the musical is now in both companies' repertoire. A Sing-along Sound of Music revival screening was first shown at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 1999, leading to a successful run at the Prince Charles Cinema which is ongoing as of 2018. During the screenings, audience members are often dressed as nuns and von Trapp children and are encouraged to sing along to lyrics superimposed on the screen. In July 2000, Sing-along Sound of Music shows opened in Boston, Massachusetts, and Austin, Texas. Some audience members dressed up as cast members and interacted with the action shown on the screen. The film began a successful run at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City in September 2000, with the opening attended by cast members Charmian Carr (Liesl), Daniel Truhitte (Rolfe), and Kym Karath (Gretl). Sing-along Sound of Music screenings have since become an international phenomenon. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".

Directed by the multiple Academy Award winning luminary Robert Wise (who also directed \u2018West Side Story\u2019), the film boasted the talents of Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and was phenomenal commercial success, managing to rake in three hundred million dollars way back in the 1960s. Today, the legacy of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is irreproachable, having five Academy Awards to its name and enduring renown that continues to make the film relevant even today. Based on the 1959 stage musical of the same name (which in turn is based on the memoir \u201cThe Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u201d by Maria von Trapp), \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 follows the von Trapp family and their new governess Maria. Maria is a struggling nun who is assigned the job of taking care of the exceedingly mischievous seven von Trapp children. Their father, Georg von Trapp, is a retired naval captain who runs his household with military discipline after the death of his wife. While initially cold and hostile towards Maria, the von Trapp children eventually fall for her kind demeanor and melodious personality. Even the stoic captain finds himself falling for Maria affable charms but their idyllic lifestyle is threatened when the Nazis start to take over their country. If you were wondering what were \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 filming locations, read on. The backdrop for much of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is the charming pre World War II town of Salzburg in Austria during the 1930s. The scenery shows off distant snow-capped mountain peaks, verdant hilltops perfect for breaking into a spontaneous melody, and cultured medieval buildings that occupy the imagination. While it is possible to recreate these distinctive features of the region on a set as well, such a facsimile is unlikely to be nearly as authentic as the real thing. This is especially true of the 1960s when CGI wasn\u2019t really an option for filmmakers. Keeping this in mind, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 was largely filmed on location in Austria itself, specifically in the city of Salzburg. Limited filming for scenes was also done in studio in California, as well as a few scenes in Bavaria, Germany. Principal filming commenced in late March 1964 and concluded later that year in September.

The production started out with the filming of Maria\u2019s bedroom scenes as well as the nun Abbey cloister. Sketch artist Maurice Zuberano accompanied director Robert Wise to scout for locations in Austria. After a ten week period, Zuberano prepared a set of storyboards and location photos to art director Boris Leven, who designed and constructed the interior sets at Fox Studios in painstaking detail. It is on these sets that parts of the gazebo scenes in the wildly popular songs \u201cSomething Good\u201d and \u201cSixteen Going on Seventeen\u201d were filmed. The 20th century Fox Studios have served as the filming location for many world renowned films and TV shows including \u2018Modern Family\u2019, \u2018Fight Club\u2019, \u2018Edward Scissorhands\u2019, and \u2018Arrested Development\u2019. The majority of the filming for \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 took place in and around the delightful city of Salzburg in Austria. The wedding scenes were filmed at the Benedictine monastery of Mondsee Abbey in Upper Austria, with on location filming also done at Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and the Altstadt Old Town area of Salzburg.

Initially, the town leaders were opposed to Wise\u2019s use of Nazi Swastika banners in the background, which were fairly central to the film\u2019s plot.

Start Traveling. Austria \u2022 See & Do One of the most famous musical films, The Sound of Music, which was filmed in 1965 is still loved by many today. Each year hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Salzburg, Austria to walk in the footsteps of the legendary Von Trapp family. If you are a fan of the movie and wondering where the Sound of Music was filmed, you\u2019ve come to the right place. From the gazebo where Liesl sings \u201c16 going on 17\u201d to the Abbey where Maria lived and got married, here are all the must-visit Sound of Music filming locations. Recommendation: Relive the scenes of some of the most popular Sound of Music locations in Salzburg including Leopoldskron Palace, Nonnberg Abbey, and Mirabell Gardens on a guided Sound of Music tour. With an English speaking guide, and songs from the soundtrack playing throughout the tour, this Original Sound of Music tour from Salzburg won\u2019t disappoint! Marvel at the breathtaking locations for the Sound of Music and sing through the streets of Salzburg. Founded in 714 A.D., Nonnberg Abbey (German: Stift Nonnberg) is the oldest female convent north of the Alps and is where the real-life Maria became a novice nun and got married to Georg von Trapp. Nonnberg is where four scenes from the movie were filmed: the scene of the nuns singing \u201cMaria\u201d in the courtyard, Maria leaving the abbey, the kids visiting her at the abbey, and the Nazi\u2019s hunting the Von Trapps. Visitors will notice the interior of the Abbey is different from the movie, as filming inside the convent was not allowed, so the interior scenes were shot in a Hollywood studio. A highlight of this Sound of Music location in Salzburg is hearing the resident nuns Gregorian chants in Latin at 6:45 in the morning inside the beautiful Gothic abbey. The small yet beautiful flower filled St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery (German: Petersfriedhof) was the inspiration for the cemetery rebuilt on set for the scene towards the end of the movie in which the Von Trapps hide from the Nazis behind tombs. Beside being the resting place of Mozart\u2019s sister, Nannerl, this is also the resting place of Max Detweiler, \u201cUncle Max\u201d from the movie. This unique cemetery is one of the oldest (and most beautiful) cemeteries in the world and is Salzburg\u2019s oldest Christian cemetery. The catacombs carved out of the rocks of M\u00f6nchsberg provide a stunning view over the beautiful cemetery and should be visited during your Sound of Music tour in Salzburg. This baroque style garden, which was built in 1606 by the archbishop Wolf Dietrich for his mistress is a beautifully landscaped garden filled with gorgeous flowers, marble statues, fountains, and ample opportunities to reenact scenes from the movies. The iconic song, \u201cDo Re, Mi\u201d was partially shot here. While visiting Mirabell gardens, you\u2019ll relive the scene of Maria and the Von Trapp kids dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, jumping up and down the steps, as well as running through the hedge maze tunnel, all the while admiring the breathtaking view of Hohensalzburg Fortress in the distance. This film location spot, which can be visited for free, should not be missed. Situated in the center of Salzburg old town is Residence Square (German: Residenzplatz), which is home to the largest (45 feet tall) baroque fountain outside of Italy. It is in this square while singing \u201cI Have Confidence in Me\u201d, that Maria happily splashes water in the fountain, The Nazi soliders also march through the square later in the movie and hang their flag over the entrance of the old Residence Palace. Built in the 17th century to wash the horses of the prince-archbishop, the Horse Pond (German: Pferdeschwemme) was briefly featured in the movie as a backdrop to Maria and the kids singing \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d while dancing in their clothes made from curtains. In addition to being featured in the musical, the Horse Pond is well worth a visit in its own right. It is situation below the cliff side of M\u00f6nchsberg, and the bright fresco behind the horse pond makes for a gorgeous picture to add to your Sound of Music tour album. Carved into the M\u00f6nchsberg, the Rock Riding School (German: Felsenreitschule) was initially built to be a cathedral, but was later repurposed by the archbishop into a riding school where tournaments were held. Today it\u2019s Salzburg\u2019s most popular concert venue and is where the real Von Trapp family won the Sal\n\nquestion: Where were some scenes filmed in Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Leopoldskron Palace, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Gardens, St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery, Residence Square, Horse Pond", "usage": 1089}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Fans will recognize this Sound of Music filming location from the scene where the Captain sings \u201cEdelweiss\u201d and his family joins him on stage to sing \u201cSo Long, Farewell\u201d. Frohnburg Palace played an important role in the Sound of Music as it was one of the two filming locations for the Von Trapp Villa. Once a private residence, the palace is now a Music Academy, the facade and large iron gate is where Maria first set her eyes on the Von Trapp family home towards the end of the song \u201cI Have Confidence\u201d. The Palace was also featured in the movie during the scenes in which the Captain rips the Nazi flag from above the doorway and during the family\u2019s attempt to escape from the Nazis by pushing their car silently out of the gate. Just outside the city center is Hellbrunn Palace, home to the Sound of Music gazebo. It was here that the most romantic scenes of the Sound of Music was captured; when Liesl gets her first kiss while singing \u201c16 going on 17.\u201d It is also where the Captain and Maria fall deeper in love with each other while singing \u201cSomething Good\u201d. Though visitors cannot go into the gazebo, they can dance, sing, and take as many pictures as they please around it. Make your visit to Hellbrunn even more exciting by taking a tour of the Trick Fountains at Hellbrunn Palace. The hour long tour takes you through grottoes, ponds, and walkways filled with trick fountains. Your ticket also lets you explore the inside of the palace. This is one of the best things to do in Salzburg and will be a memorable experience especially for the kids. Leopoldskron Palace is one of the most important filming location for the Sound of Music as the majestic palace and perfect lake view backdrop served as the primary filming location for all of the lake terrace scenes of the Von Trapp family home. This includes the scenes in which Maria and the kids fall off the boat into the lake, and when the Captain and Uncle Max are drinking pink lemonade on the terrace. Though the interior of the mansion was never filmed in the movie, the palace\u2019s gold Venetian ballroom and foyer were rebuilt in Hollywood for the interior scenes. Today the palace is a boutique hotel. Staying overnight is the only way to visit the film location up close and to get a peek into the Venetian ballroom. Staying here is the ultimate Sound of Music experience as you get to live in the home of the Von Trapp family in the film. You can book your stay at Leopoldskron Palace here. If you choose not to stay at the hotel, you can still view the Palace at a distance from the west side of the lake. Though not a filming location, the Von Trapp Villa is where the real Von Trapp family lived for 15 years. They managed to get onto a train at the nearby station to escape the Nazis one day before the Austrian borders were closed. Today the Von Trapp Villa operates as a hotel and an educational Sound of Music museum of the real Von Trapp family as well as behind the scenes information about the filming of the movie. Not far from Leopoldskron Palace, a visit to the Von Trapp Villa would give fans a true insight on the life of the legendary Von Trapp family that we have come to love. Fans can either book a stay at the Villa or simply visit on a guided tour which takes place every day and lasts about 45 minutes. Mt. Untersberg is depicted twice in the Sound of Music, once during the opening scene in which Maria is singing the \u201cSound of Music\u201d and again when the family is escaping over the mountain to Switzerland while singing \u201cClimb Every Mountain\u201d. Fans can easily access Mount Untersberg from Salzburg via bus and get to the top via cable car. More adventurous travelers can hike 2 hours to the top. At 1,853 meters above the Salzburg basin, Mt. Untersberg offers breaktaking views over the region and is worth the day trip from Salzburg. Less than an hour bus drive from Salzburg is the picturesque lakeside town Mondsee. There you can visit the beautiful Collegiate Church of St. Michael where Maria and Georg von Trapp got married in the movie. This is a must-see for any Sound of Music fan. Make a full-day trip out of the location and stroll through the town, take a refreshing dip in the lake, hike up the nearby forest, and eat delicious seafood along the lake. In the opening scene of the movie you get a gorgeous aerial view of the village of St. Gilgen and the popular lake, Wolfgangsee. The village and lake can easily be reached by train.

The short 1.4km hike from the Werfen town takes about half an hour to complete. Once at the top you can enjoy a picnic and breathtaking views of the surrounding areas and the Hohenwerfen Fortress. Make your trip to Werfen a full day adventure by visiting both the Hohenwerfen Fortress and the largest ice cave in the world, Eisriesenwelt. Both sights will be a welcome addition to your Salzburg itinerary. Situated just across the German border, atop the magnificent Rossfeld mountain, is the Rossfeld Panoramic Road which was used in the movie to show the safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain. The private road, Rossfeld Panoramic Road is the only filming location that\u2019s difficult to get to without a car. If you don\u2019t have a car, it is recommended to visit the nearby Untersberg Mountain to get just as spectacular views with easier accessibility. Well there you have it, the top must-visit Sound of Music filming location in and around Salzburg. All locations can be visited on your own, but if you don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle or you have limited time, consider taking a guided Sound of Music tour from Salzburg or Vienna. And to make your Sound of Music trip even more memorable, spend a night or two at the home of the Von Trapp family in the film; Hotel Schloss Leopoldskron, or in the home of the real Von Trapp family at Villa Trapp. Either one will take your trip from amazing to extraordinary. Waseem says 1 month ago The Sound of Music gazebo at Hellbrunn Palace in Salzburg was moved here from its original location at Schloss Leopoldskron. Allan Trivette says 5 months ago The writer/compiler of this page shows an obvious love for the film. I was put under a \u201cSound of Music\u201d spell at the age of 10 when the film first came out, and I\u2019m still spellbound to this day. I\u2019ve visited Salzburg 5 times, and I can\u2019t wait to go back again. But, there are a few errors on this page that need to be clarified and/or corrected. First \u2013 #7 Frohnburg Palace \u2013 the writer of this article is correct \u2013 it WAS used as the von Trapp home in the film. However, what we see in the film as the FRONT of the von Trapp home is actually the BACK of Frohnburg! The FRONT of Frohnburg was used as the BACK of the von Trapp home in the film! The back of the home is seen when Rolf comes to deliver a telegram and the Captain takes it abruptly and tells him to leave. You see it also when the pink lemonade is served. Now, to make this even more complicated, the back of the film home looking toward the lake: the canoe flipping, the Baroness and the Captain strolling by the lake, Leisl running out to meet Rolf, Maria\u2019s return when she comes back from the Abbey, etc., is located to the left of Schloss Leopoldskron. I\u2019ll write more about this below. #8 \u2013 Hellbrun Palace (the gazebo) \u2013 correction \u2013 NONE of the gazebo scenes (\u201c16 Going on 17\u201d and \u201cSomething Good\u201d) were shot anywhere near the gazebo. It was a set in Hollywood. The only time we see the gazebo that is at Hellbrun is when the Captain and the Baroness take their stroll by the lake (just before the canoe flipping). It can be seen briefly in the background during their stroll. #9 \u2013 Leopoldskron Palace \u2013 was NOT used at ALL at any time during the filming!! The production company DID want to film the lake scenes there, but the officials of the Palace at that time wanted too much money. They did, however, offer the company the use of the \u201cside lawn\u201d. If you look at the photo of the Palace on this page, the side lawn is not seen, but it is to the left of the photo\u2019s edge. The \u201cOfficial Sound of Music Tour\u201d guides will show you the Schloss and point out the original horse-headed statues and lake gate and tell you that is where those scenes were filmed. WRONG!!! The \u201clake-gate\u201d and the horse-headed fish statues, were recreated by 20th Century-Fox and erected on the \u201cside lawn\u201d where the Meierhof is now located. The Meierhof used to be the administrative offices for the Palace, but it\n\nquestion: Where were some scenes filmed in Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Werfen town, Hohenwerfen Fortress, and the Rossfeld Panoramic Road.", "usage": 1069}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If one enters the main gate for the Schloss, the Schloss is to the left and the Meierhof is to the right. Walking straight from the gate to the lake one will see the pedestals for the horse-headed statues are still there. As was stated by the writer, the Venetian Room is in the Schloss and was used as the inspiration for the ballroom in the film. #11 \u2013 Mount Untersberg \u2013 clarification \u2013 the mount is seen several times in the background of several scenes, but NO SCENES were filmed ON it. #15 \u2013 Rossfeld Mountain \u2013 clarification \u2013 again, \u201cthe safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain\u201d is inaccurate. That \u201cescape\u201d scene was filmed just off the Rossfeld Panoramastrasse. There is a roadside cafe/restaurant on the Panoramastrasse called the Ahornkaser (they serve the best Apple Strudel you\u2019ll ever have). Standing in front of the Ahornkaser, there is a path on the right side of the building. Take that path about 400 feet and look up to your right. At the top of the hill is the exact spot where the von Trapps cross the mountain to freedom as \u201cClimb Ev\u2019ry Mountain\u201d is sung. At the end of that scene, with that open vista lying before them, you can see the Untersberg in the distance. I hope this helps/informs anyone planning on making a visit. Negar Modgeddi says 1 month ago I LOVE your notations about the actual places and your very thoughtful corrections! Melanie says 6 months ago Thank you for this great information! Do you know which field Maria was walking in during the opening scene? I know it was Untersberg Mountain in the background, but I can\u2019t find any information on the field she was frolicking through to get that sweeping view. Any pointers you can offer would be most appreciated! Ben says 6 months ago The opening scene was filmed on Mehlweg meadow which is not open to the public.

The opening aerial shots are Salzburg\u2019s glorious Lake District, the Salzkammergut. The castles you can see are Kloster H\u00f6glw\u00f6rth, an old monastery on a peninsula in H\u00f6glw\u00f6rther See; and Schloss Anif, off E55 a few miles south of Salzburg. The mountain, atop which Maria (Julie Andrews) makes her first twirling appearance, is Mehlweg, near the Bavarian village of Markt Schellenberg, about six miles from Salzburg. Don\u2019t be too disappointed \u2013 the birch trees and the babbling brook were added for the movie. Convent interiors were recreated in the studio, but the exterior really is Maria\u2019s abbey. It\u2019s Nonnberg Abbey, Nonnberg Gasse, where you can visit the courtyard and peek inside the chapel (which looks nothing like the interior recreated back in Hollywood). The film cheats a little with the exterior, too. As you\u2019ll find if you visit, the real Nonnberg Abbey doesn\u2019t look out over the picturesque old town of Salzburg, but to the nondescript southern suburbs. The reverse shot, of Maria leaving the abbey, filmed way across the city on the Humboldt Terrace (seen later in the Do Re Mi number), in front of the Museum of Modern Art, which since 2002 has stood atop M\u00f6nchsberg Cliffs on the site of the old Cafe Winkler. As Maria leaves to take up her post with the Von Trapp family, I Have Confidence in Me was filmed in Salzburg\u2019s Old Town, in the Residenzplatz, where you\u2019ll see the Domplatz arches, through which Maria enters, and the Residenz Fountain, in which she splashes. The \u2018Villa Von Trapp\u2019 is a combination of two different Salzburg locations. The tree-shaded lane, where Maria alights from the bus, is Hellbrunner Allee, running south from the old town. Here you\u2019ll recognise Schloss Frohnburg, a 17th century country house, now the Mozarteum Music Academy, which was used for the intimidating gates and front entrance of the villa which Maria nervously approaches. The lakeside terrace, though, was filmed at Schloss Leopoldskron, a rococo castle on Leopoldskroner Teich, a small artificial lake on the southwest of the town. You can view Leopoldskron across the lake from K\u00f6nig Ludwig Strasse, but it's now \u2013 hurrah! \u2013 a hotel. Leopoldskron's extravagantly gilt Venetian Room was replicated in the studio in Hollywood. Incidentally, the famous gazebo originally stood on the palace's grounds, when it was a private villa, but was moved to a more accessible location. The real Villa Trapp, by the way, is in Aigen, a suburb just to the southeast of the Old Town of Salzburg. Since 2008, it\u2019s been open as a hotel, Villa Trapp, Traunstra\u00dfe 34, 5026 Salzburg. There\u2019s a rail service to Bahnhof Aigen. The little footbridge over which the von Trapps skip at the beginning of the My Favourite Things montage of Salzburg is Mozart Steg, north of Mozart Platz. They quickly move on to Domplatz, in front of Salzburger Dom (Salzburg Cathedral); Kapitelschwemme, the Baroque horse pond once used for watering and cleaning horses, in Herbert von Karajan Platz; and the market on Kajetanerplatz, just north of Nonnberg Abbey, where Maria demonstrates her tomato juggling skills. They finally head off for a picnic in the meadow above the village of Werfen, 25 miles south of Salzburg in the Salzach River valley (where you can also visit the castle from wartime action movie Where Eagles Dare). Do-Re-Mi begins at the picnic, returning to Salzburg atop the Monchsberg Cliffs, on Humboldt Terrace which you can reach from the Monchsberg elevator in Anton Neumayrplatz, at the end of the Gstattengasse shopping street, and continuing with a carriage ride south from St Erhard Kirche, the Parish Church of St Erhard, along Nonntaler Hauptstra\u00dfe,\n\nquestion: Where were some scenes filmed in Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Lake District, Nonnberg Abbey, Residenzplatz, Hellbrunner Allee, Old Town, Schloss Frohnburg, Schloss Leopoldskron, Mozart Steg, Domplatz, Kapitelschwemme, Kajetanerplatz", "usage": 1090}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The number climaxes at Mirabell Gardens, on Schwarzstrasse, over the Salzach River behind Schloss Mirabell, where you\u2019ll find the fountains, statues and, famously, the flight of steps on which the children hop. The Von Trapp gazebo, used for Sixteen Going On Seventeen, once stood in the grounds of Leopoldskron, but constant trespassing resulted in it being moved and reconstructed in the ornamental gardens of Schloss Hellbrunn, Morzger Strasse, toward the south of Salzburg. And another cheat. It was recreated, slightly larger, back at 20th Century-Fox in Hollywood for the interior shots. Maria\u2019s wedding, which took place in Nonnberg Abbey, was filmed in the baroque, twin-towered St Michael\u2019s Church, Wredeplatz, in Mondsee, about 15 miles east of Salzburg on the E55/E60. The Anschluss scene, Austria\u2019s enforced unity with Nazi Germany, was staged back in the centre of Salzburg itself in Residenzplatz. The music festival, at which the von Trapp family perform their disappearing act, is at the Felsenreitschule (\u2018Rock Riding School\u2019), Hofstallgasse 1, a 1400-seat theatre built in what was a rock quarry for Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun in 1693, and used as the archbishop's riding school. It\u2019s one of the sites of the Salzburg Festival. Despite what some overenthusiastic tour guides might tell you, the cemetery in which the von Trapps hide from the Nazis is a Hollywood studio set, though its design is clearly based on St Peter\u2019s Graveyard, which you can see just off Kapitelplatz.

Adapted from the 1959 stage musical of the same name, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is actually based on the memoir, titled \u2018The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u2019. The story deals with a postulant, who goes to the imposing home of a retired naval officer. The man is a widower, and the young woman acts as a governess to his children. Soon enough, she brings music and love to the entire family, and it is not long before she falls in love with her employer as well. Together they band, as they have to face the loss of their motherland to the Nazis. If you have seen the movie, you already know that it takes place in Salzburg in Austria. Over the course of the film, there are several iconic scenes that have been shot at picturesque locations, or there are some locations that have been simply elevated due to the value of the scene itself (think of the gazebo where \u2018Sixteen Going on Seventeen\u2019 is performed). Naturally, you might be wondering about the exact filming locations of this popular movie, and we have got you covered in that regard. When \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 started filming, the crew did not head immediately to the real locations for the movie. Instead, when principal photography began on March 26, 1964, it started at the 20th Century Fox studios located in Los Angeles. Following this, the crew headed to Salzburg, where they filmed at a variety of locations including the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and Residence Fountain, among others. Filming commenced here from April 23, to around May 22. Various other locations nearby were used, and shooting went on till around June 19. The crew also hit up places nearby including Werfen in the Salzach River valley. Some scenes were also shot in Bavaria, with the Alps serving as a wonderful backdrop. Around July 6, the team headed back to Los Angeles for the remaining scenes, and principal photography ultimately wrapped up by September 1, 1964. As is evident, a plethora of locations have been hit in this frenzied shooting schedule, and we now proceed to the specific filming locations, rendered memorable by the iconic scenes that have unfolded there. Salzburg in Austria serves as the place where most of the pivotal scenes of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place. Some of the most recognizable locations include Mirabell Palace and Gardens. If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you must know that \u2018Do re mi\u2019 is one of the most popular songs. The ending of this song sees Maria and the von Trapp kids at the Mirabell Palace and Gardens. Located in Salzburg\u2019s old town, we can see the movie characters dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, which is located in front of the palace. The other recognizable locations happen to be the rose garden at the north of the fountain and the Greek fencing statues at the entrance. Residenzplatz Square and Fountain also plays an important part, early on, as Maria can be seen splashing in the baroque horse fountain here, while \u2018I Have Confidence in Me\u2019 is playing. When Germany annexes Austria, we see Nazi soldiers marching through this square, while a Swastika flag is raised above the Old Residence Palace\u2019s entrance. The Summer Riding School (Felsenreitschule) is where the von Trapp family takes the stage, performing \u2018Edelweiss\u2019 and \u2018So long, Farewell\u2019, for the Folk Festival. Notably, hundreds of extras were hired for the scene to sing along. A little away from this location, on Herbert von Karajan Square, is the Horse Pond, where Maria and the children dance at the end of \u2018My Favorite Things\u2019. Leopoldskron Palace is important in its own way since all the lake terrace scenes of the von Trapp family home were shot here. Schloss Frohnburg was also used to show the von Trapp house, rather the intimidating front gates which Maria nervously approaches initially. Nonnberg Abbey Convent is where Maria lived, and the exteriors of the same have been used in the movie. However, the movie has taken some liberties here, as the convent does not actually look over the old town of Salzburg, but instead has a view of the nondescript southern suburbs. St. Michael Basilica in Mondsee, outside Salzburg, is remarkable because Maria gets married to Georg von Trapp, in one of the most famous scenes from the movie. Werfen, which is around a 40-minute drive away from Salzburg, has the Gschwandtanger Meadow, which\n\nquestion: Where were some scenes filmed in Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Mirabell Palace and Gardens, Residenzplatz Square and Fountain, Summer Riding School (Felsenreitschule), Leopoldskron Palace, Schloss Frohnburg, Nonnberg Abbey Convent, St. Michael Basilica in Mondsee", "usage": 1132}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Bavaria is important for being one of the first scenes where Maria makes her entrance. She can be seen twirling at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg. The sequence where the von Trapps escape the Nazis is also shot on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. Notably, Stage 8 and Stage 15 were used in the studios, but a lot of important scenes were shot there. Firstly, shooting inside the convent was not allowed, meaning that the set was created in the studio itself. The golden foyer and the ballroom, we see in the house, were also recreated in Hollywood. There is an important scene where the Von Trapp family hides from the Nazis behind some tombs. While the scenes have been recreated in Hollywood, they closely resemble St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery and Catacombs in Salzburg. The gazebo where two of the finest songs in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place, that is, \u2018Something Good\u2019 and \u201916 going on 17\u2032, is actually both a real-life location as well as something created in a studio. The real-life gazebo is near the Eastern entrance to the Hellbrunn Palace. A larger one was rebuilt in Hollywood where most of the scenes were actually shot. As is evident, the scenes in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 have been carefully shot to capture the beauty of the location and to transport us into this enchanting world inhabited by the von Trapp family and Maria. Making the best use of the locations is just one small aspect that has helped this film go down in history as one of the most memorable examples of great cinema.

The film is an adaptation of the 1959 stage musical, composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and a book by Lindsay and Crouse. Based on the 1949 memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria von Trapp, the film is set in Salzburg, Austria and is a fictional retelling of her experiences as governess to seven children, her eventual marriage with their father Captain Georg Von Trapp, and their escape during the Anschluss in 1938. Filming took place from March to September 1964 in Los Angeles and Salzburg. The Sound of Music was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited roadshow theatrical release. Although initial critical response to the film was mixed, it was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office film after four weeks, and the highest-grossing film of 1965. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all-time\u2014surpassing Gone with the Wind\u2014and held that distinction for five years. The film was just as popular throughout the world, breaking previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries. Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years, and two successful re-releases, the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286 million. The Sound of Music received five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Wise's second pair of both awards, the first being from the 1961 film West Side Story. The film also received two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture and Best Actress, the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. In 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) listed The Sound of Music as the fifty-fifth greatest American film of all time, and the fourth-greatest film musical. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg in 1938. Her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern. Mother Abbess sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children\u2014Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children out of drapes that are to be changed. She takes them around Salzburg and the mountains while teaching them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake which concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain attempts to fire Maria. However, he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. The Captain apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay. Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes that he enters them in the upcoming Salzburg Festival, but the Captain disapproves of letting his children sing in public. During a grand party at the villa, where guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional L\u00e4ndler folk dance, he steps in and partners Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy by indirectly convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. However, Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, so she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her purpose in life. When Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. However, the Baroness learns that the Captain's feelings\n\nquestion: Where were some scenes filmed in Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1120}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

While the couple is on their honeymoon, Max enters the children into the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. Having learned that Austria has been annexed by the Third Reich, the couple return to their home, where the Captain receives a telegram, ordering him to report to the German Naval base at Bremerhaven to accept a commission in the Kriegsmarine. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and their ideology, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. That night, the von Trapp family attempt to flee to Switzerland, but they are stopped by a group of Brownshirts, led by the Gauleiter Hans Zeller, waiting outside the villa. To cover his family's tracks, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven. Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slips away and seeks shelter at the abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Zeller and his men soon arrive and search the abbey, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When they attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start, as two of the nuns have sabotaged their engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom. The real Maria von Trapp has a brief uncredited cameo as a passerby, alongside her children Rosmarie and Werner von Trapp during \"I Have Confidence\". The Sound of Music story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, published in 1949 to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband Georg in 1947. Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told. In 1956, German producer Wolfgang Liebeneiner purchased the film rights for $9,000 (equivalent to $97,000 in 2022), hired George Hurdalek and Herbert Reinecker to write the screenplay, and Franz Grothe to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional Austrian folk songs. The Trapp Family was released in West Germany on October 9, 1956, and became a major success. Two years later, Liebeneiner directed a sequel, The Trapp Family in America, and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years. Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America. In 1956, Paramount Pictures purchased the United States film rights, intending to produce an English-language version with Audrey Hepburn as Maria. The studio eventually dropped its option, but one of its directors, Vincent J. Donehue, proposed the story as a stage musical for Mary Martin. Producers Richard Halliday and Leland Heyward secured the rights and hired playwrights Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, who had won the Pulitzer Prize for State of the Union. They approached Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II to compose one song for the musical, but the composers felt the two styles\u2014traditional Austrian folk songs and their composition\u2014would not work together. They offered to write a completely new score for the entire production if the producers were willing to wait while they completed work on Flower Drum Song. The producers quickly responded that they would wait as long as necessary. The Sound of Music stage musical opened on November 16, 1959, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York City and ran on Broadway for 1,443 performances, winning six Tony Awards, including Best Musical. In June 1960, Twentieth Century-Fox purchased the film adaptation rights to the stage musical for $1.25 million (equivalent to $12,400,000 in 2022) against ten percent of the gross. In December 1962, 20th Century-Fox president Richard D. Zanuck hired Ernest Lehman to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of the stage musical. Lehman reviewed the original script for the stage musical, rearranged the sequence of songs, and began transforming a work designed for the stage into a film that could use the camera to emphasize action and mood and open the story up to the beautiful locations of Salzburg and the Austrian Alps. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" sequence in the play, for example, was originally a stagnant number; Lehman transformed it into a lively montage showing some of the beautiful sites of Salzburg, as well as showing Maria and the children growing closer over time. Lehman also eliminated two songs, \"How Can Love Survive?\" and \"No Way to Stop It\", sung by the characters of Elsa and Max. In January 1963, he saw the Fox English-d\n\nquestion: Where were some scenes filmed in Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Austria", "usage": 1128}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material. While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director. Their first choice was Robert Wise, with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of West Side Story, but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, The Sand Pebbles. Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including Stanley Donen, Vincent J. Donehue, George Roy Hill, and Gene Kelly. In January 1963, Lehman invited one of his favorite directors, William Wyler, to travel to New York City with him to see the Broadway musical. After seeing the show, Wyler said he hated it, but after two weeks of Lehman's persuasion, Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film. After hiring musical supervisor Roger Edens, Wyler, Lehman, and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations. In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy-five locations\u2014an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences. During that trip, Lehman began to have reservations about Wyler's commitment to the project and communicated this to Zanuck, who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible. Lehman completed the first draft on September 10, 1963, and sent it to Wyler, who had no suggestions or changes to add. At that time, Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise, whom Lehman still wanted as the director. Later that month, Wyler's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct The Collector. Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film, and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director, ending Wyler's participation. Meanwhile, Wise, whose film The Sand Pebbles had been postponed, read Lehman's first draft, was impressed by what he read, and agreed to direct the film, joining the picture in October 1963, and flew to Salzburg with associate producer Saul Chaplin and members of his production team to scout filming locations, including many that Wyler had identified. When he returned, Wise began working on the script. Wise shared Lehman's vision of the film being centered on the music, and the changes he made were consistent with the writer's approach\u2014mainly reducing the amount of sweetness and sentimentality found in the stage musical. He had reservations about Lehman's opening aerial sequence because West Side Story, whose screenplay Lehman had also written, had used a similar opening sequence, but he was unable to think of a better one and decided to keep Lehman's. Other changes included replacing \"An Ordinary Couple\" with a more romantic number, and a new song for Maria's departure from the abbey\u2014Rodgers provided \"Something Good\" and \"I Have Confidence\", especially for the film. Lehman completed the second draft on December 20, 1963, but additional changes would be made based on input from Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer about the character of the Captain. Plummer especially helped change a character lacking substance into a stronger, more forceful complex figure with a wry sense of humor and a darker edge. Lehman completed his final draft on March 20, 1964. Lehman's first and only choice for Maria was Julie Andrews. When Wise joined the project, he made a list of his choices for the role, which included Andrews as his first choice, Grace Kelly, and Shirley Jones. Wise and Lehman went to Disney Studios to view footage from Mary Poppins, which was not yet released. A few minutes into the film, Wise told Lehman, \"Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this film and grabs her!\" Andrews had some reservations\u2014mainly about the amount of sweetness in the theatrical version\u2014but when she learned that her concerns were shared by Wise and Lehman and what their vision was, she signed a contract with Fox to star in The Sound of Music and one other film for $225,000 (equivalent to $2,120,000 in 2022). Wise had a more difficult time casting the role of the Captain. A number of actors were considered for the part, including Bing Crosby, Yul Brynner, Sean Connery, and Richard Burton. Wise had seen Christopher Plummer on Broadway and wanted him for the role, but the stage actor turned down the offer several times. Wise flew to London to meet with Plummer and explained his concept of the film; the actor accepted after being assured that he could work with Lehman to improve the character. Wise also spent considerable time and effort on casting the secondary characters. For the role of Max Detweiler, Wise initially considered Victor Borge, No\u00ebl Coward, and Hal Holbrook among others before deciding on Richard Haydn. For the character of Baroness Elsa Schraeder\n\nquestion: Where were some scenes filmed in Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "In Salzburg.", "usage": 1124}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The casting of the children's characters began in November 1963 and involved over two hundred interviews and auditions throughout the United States and England. Some of the child actors interviewed or tested, who were not selected, included Mia Farrow, Patty Duke, Lesley Ann Warren, Geraldine Chaplin, Shelley Fabares, Teri Garr, Kurt Russell, and The Osmonds. Most of the actors selected had some acting, singing, or dancing experience. Charmian Carr, however, was a model who worked part-time in a doctor's office and had no ambition to pursue a career as an actress. After a friend sent her photo to Wise's office, she was asked to interview. Wise later recalled, \"She was so pretty and had such poise and charm that we liked her immediately.\" The last person to be cast was Daniel Truhitte in the role of Rolfe. Rehearsals for the singing and dance sequences began on February 10, 1964. The husband-and-wife team of Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, who had worked with Andrews on Mary Poppins, worked out the choreography with Saul Chaplin on piano\u2014the arrangements could not be altered under Rodgers and Hammerstein's contract. The stage choreography was not used because it was too restrictive. Breaux and Wood worked out all-new choreography better suited for the film that incorporated many of the Salzburg locations and settings. They even choreographed the newly added puppet dance sequence for \"The Lonely Goatherd\". The choreography for the L\u00e4ndler strictly followed the traditional Austrian folk dance. The musical arranger Irwin Kostal prerecorded the songs with a large orchestra and singers on a stage before the start of filming. In her book, The Sound of Music: The Making of America's Favorite Movie, Julia Antopol Hirsch says that Kostal used seven children and five adults to record the children's voices; the only scene in which the child-actors' singing is heard in the released version of the film is when they sing \"The Sound of Music\" on their own after Maria leaves. Charmian Carr refuted the claim that the voices of the child actors were dubbed in the film and on the soundtrack. Carr contended that all of the children who are in the film sing on the track, but four other children were added to most of the songs to give them a fuller sound; they did not replace them as singers. The voices of some of the adult actors had voice doubles, including those of Peggy Wood and Christopher Plummer. Principal photography began on March 26, 1964, at 20th Century-Fox studios in Los Angeles, where scenes from Maria's bedroom and the abbey cloister and graveyard were filmed. The company then flew to Salzburg, where filming resumed on April 23 at Mondsee Abbey for the wedding scenes. From April 25 through May 22, scenes were filmed at the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, Residence Fountain, and various street locations throughout the Altstadt (Old Town) area of the city. Wise faced opposition from city leaders who did not want him staging scenes with swastika banners. They relented after he threatened instead to include old newsreel footage featuring the banners. On days when it rained, a constant challenge for the company, Wise arranged for scenes to be shot at St. Margarethen Chapel and D\u00fcrer Studios (Reverend Mother's office). From May 23 to June 7, the company worked at Schloss Leopoldskron and an adjacent property called Bertelsmann for scenes representing the lakeside terrace and gardens of the von Trapp villa. From June 9 to 19, scenes were shot at Frohnburg Palace, which represented the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa. Karath could not swim and was in danger during the capsizing boat scene. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" picnic scene in the mountains was filmed above the town of Werfen in the Salzach River valley on June 25 and 27. The opening sequence of Maria on her mountain was filmed from June 28 to July 2 at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg in Bavaria. During filming, Birch trees were added and then removed. The brook she walks through was plastic filled with water which was put there during filming. The final scene of the von Trapp family escaping over the mountains was filmed on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. The cast and crew flew back to Los Angeles and resumed filming at Fox Studios on July 6 for all remaining scenes, including those in the villa dining room, ballroom, terrace, living room, and gazebo. Following the last two scenes shot in the gazebo\u2014for the songs \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Sevent\n\nquestion: Where were some scenes filmed in Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Mondsee Abbey, Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, Residence Fountain.", "usage": 1142}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A total of eighty-three scenes were filmed in just over five months. Post-production work began on August 25 with three weeks of dialogue dubbing to correct lines that were ruined by various street noises and rain. In October, Christopher Plummer's singing voice was dubbed by veteran Disney playback singer Bill Lee. The film was then edited by Wise and film editor William Reynolds. Once the film was edited, Irwin Kostal, who orchestrated the musical numbers, underscored the film with background music consisting of variations on Rodgers and Hammerstein's original songs to amplify or add nuances to the visual images. When dubbing, editing, and scoring were complete, Wise arranged for two sneak-preview showings\u2014the first one held in Minneapolis on Friday, January 15, 1965 at the Mann Theater, and the second one held the following night in Tulsa. Despite the \"sensational\" responses from the preview audiences, Wise made a few final editing changes before completing the film. According to the original print information for the film, the running time for the theatrical release version was 174 minutes. The film was still in release when the Motion Picture Association of America's film ratings system was implemented in 1968, and was subsequently given a \"G\" rating (\"general audiences\") in 1969. The Sound of Music was filmed in Todd-AO by Ted McCord and produced with DeLuxe Color processing. Aerial footage was photographed with an MCS-70 camera. The sound was recorded on a 70 mm six-track using a Westrex recording system. The sets used for the film were based on the storyboards of sketch artist Maurice Zuberano, who accompanied Wise to Austria to scout filming locations in November 1963. Wise met with the artist over ten weeks and explained his objective for each scene\u2014the feeling he wanted to convey and the visual images he wanted to use. When Zuberano was finished, he provided Wise with a complete set of storyboards that illustrated each scene and set\u2014storyboards the director used as guidance during filming. Zuberano's storyboards and location photos were also used by art director Boris Leven to design and construct all of the original interior sets at Fox studios, as well as some external sets in Salzburg. The von Trapp villa, for example, was actually filmed in several locations: the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa were filmed at Frohnburg Palace, the lakeside terrace and gardens was a set constructed on a property adjacent to Schloss Leopoldskron called Bertelsmann, and the interior was a constructed set at Fox Studios. The gazebo scenes for \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" were filmed on a larger reconstructed set at Fox studios, while some shots of the original gazebo were filmed on the grounds at Schloss Leopoldskron in Salzburg. Most of the soundtrack to The Sound of Music was written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and arranged and conducted by Irwin Kostal, who also adapted the instrumental underscore passages. Both the lyrics and music for two new songs were written by Rodgers, as Hammerstein died in 1960. The soundtrack album was released by RCA Victor in 1965 and is one of the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 20 million copies worldwide. The album reached the number one position on the Billboard 200 that year in the United States. It remained in the top ten for 109 weeks, from May 1, 1965, to July 16, 1967, and remained on the Billboard 200 chart for 238 weeks. The album was the best-selling album in the United Kingdom in 1965, 1966, and 1968 and the second best-selling of the entire decade, spending a total of 70 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It also stayed 73 weeks on the Norwegian charts, becoming the seventh best-charting album of all time in that country. In 2015, Billboard named the album the second greatest album of all time. The album has been reissued several times, including anniversary editions with additional tracks in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Wise hired Mike Kaplan to direct the publicity campaign for the film. After reading the script, Kaplan decided on the ad line \"The Happiest Sound in All the World\", which would appear on promotional material and artwork. Kaplan also brought in outside agencies to work with the studio's advertising department to develop the promotional artwork, eventually selecting a painting by Howard Terpning of Andrews on an alpine meadow with her carpetbag and guitar case in hand with the children and Plummer in the background. In February 1964, Kaplan began placing ads in the trade papers Daily Variety, Weekly Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter to attract future exhibitor interest in the project. The studio intended the film to have an initial roadshow theatrical release in select large cities in theaters that could accommodate the 70-mm screenings and six-track stereophonic sound.

Kaplan identified forty key cities that would likely be included in the roadshow release and developed a promotional strategy targeting the major newspapers of those cities. During the Salzburg production phase, 20th Century-Fox organized press junkets for American journalists to interview Wise and his team and the cast members. \"No one is comfortable with an excess of hearts and flowers, but there is no valid reason for hiding honest emotion. This has always been a major element in the theatre, and it's my conviction that anyone who can't, on occasion, be sentimental about children, home or nature is sadly maladjusted.\" Richard Rodgers The film had its opening premiere on March 2, 1965, at the Rivoli Theater in New York City. Initial reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's \"romantic nonsense and sentiment\", the children's \"artificial roles\", and Robert Wise's \"cosy-cum-corny\" direction. Judith Crist, in a biting review in the New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as \"icky sticky\" and designed for \"the five to seven set and their mommies\". In her review for McCall's magazine, Pauline Kael called the film \"the sugar-coated lie people seem to want to eat\", and that audiences have \"turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs.\" Wise later recalled, \"The East Coast, intellectual papers and magazines destroyed us, but the local papers and the trades gave us great reviews\". Indeed, reviewers such as Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \"three hours of visual and vocal brilliance\", and Variety called it \"a warmly-pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast\". The \"wildly mixed film reviews\" reflected the critical response to the stage musical, according to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical. After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10, The Sound of Music opened in 131 theaters in the United States, including a limited number of roadshow events. After four weeks, the film became the number one box office movie in the country and held that position for thirty out of the next forty-three weeks in 1965. The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years. A few months after its United States release, The Sound of Music opened in 261 theaters in other countries, the first American movie to be completely dubbed in a foreign language, both dialogue, and music. The German, French, Italian, and Spanish versions were completely dubbed, the Japanese version had Japanese dialogue with English songs, and other versions were released with foreign subtitles. The film was a popular success in every country it opened, except the two countries where the story originated, Austria and Germany. In these two countries, the film had to compete with the much-loved Die Trapp-Familie (1956), which provided the original inspiration for the Broadway musical, and its sequel Die Trapp-Familie in Amerika (1958); both films are still widely popular in German-speaking Europe and considered the authoritative von Trapp story. Austrians took exception to the liberties taken by the filmmakers with regard to the costumes, which did not reflect the traditional style and the replacement of traditional Austrian folk songs with Broadway show tunes. The film's Nazi theme was especially unpopular in Germany, where the Munich branch manager for 20th Century-Fox approved the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act of the film following the wedding sequence\u2014the scenes showing Salzburg following the Anschluss. Robert Wise and the studio intervened, the original film was restored, and the branch manager was fired. The Sound of Music holds an 84% \"Certified Fresh\" score on Rotten Tomatoes based on seventy-four reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's consensus states: \"Unapologetically sweet and maybe even a little corny, The Sound of Music will win over all but the most cynical filmgoers with its classic songs and irresistible warmth.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on eleven critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The Sound of Music is one of the most commercially successful films of all time. Four weeks after its theatrical release, it became the number one box office movie in the United States, from revenue generated by twenty-five theaters, each screening only ten roadshow performances per week. It held the number one position for thirty of the next forty-three weeks, and ended up the highest-grossing film of 1965. One contributing factor in the film's early commercial success was the repeat business of many filmgoers. In some cities in the United States, the number of tickets sold exceeded the total population.

Worldwide, The Sound of Music broke previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries, including the United Kingdom, where it played for a record-breaking three years at the Dominion Theatre in London and earned \u00a34 million in rentals and grossed \u00a36 million\u2014more than twice as much as any other film had taken in. It was also a major success in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, where it played for as long as two years at some theaters. It was not a universal success, however, with the film only enjoying modest success in France and it was a flop in Germany. It also initially performed poorly in Italy, but a re-release after the Oscars brought better results. It was number one at the US box office for a further 11 weeks in 1966, for a total of 41 weeks at number one. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all time, with over $67.5 million in worldwide rentals ($125 million in gross receipts), surpassing Gone with the Wind, which held that distinction for twenty-four years. It was still in the top ten at the US box office in its 100th week of release. The Sound of Music completed its initial four-and-a-half year theatrical release run in the United States on Labor Day 1969, the longest initial run for a film in the US, having earned $68,313,000 in rentals in the United States and Canada. It played for 142 weeks at the Eglinton Theatre in Toronto. It was the first film to gross over $100 million. By December 1970, it had earned $121.5 million in worldwide rentals, which was over four times higher than the film's estimated break-even point of $29.5 million in rentals. The film was re-released in 1973, and increased its North American rentals to $78.4 million. By the end of the 1970s, it was ranked seventh in all-time North American rentals, having earned $79 million. The film's re-release in 1990 increased the total North American admissions to 142,415,400\u2014the third-highest number of tickets sold behind Gone with the Wind and Star Wars\u2014and about 283.3 million admissions worldwide. The Sound of Music eventually earned a total domestic gross of $163,214,076 and a total worldwide gross of $286,214,076. Adjusted for inflation, the film earned about $2.366 billion at 2014 prices\u2014placing it among the top ten highest-grossing films of all time. The Sound of Music has been included in numerous top film lists from the American Film Institute. The first American television transmission of The Sound of Music was on February 29, 1976, on ABC, which paid $15 million (equivalent to $77,140,351 in 2022) for a one-time only broadcast that became one of the top 20 rated films shown on television to that point with a Nielsen rating of 33.6 and an audience share of 49%. The movie was not shown again until NBC acquired the broadcast rights in June 1977 for $21.5 million for 20 showings over 22 years and telecast the film on February 11, 1979. NBC continued to air the film annually for twenty years. During most of its run on NBC, the film was heavily edited to fit a three-hour time slot\u2014approximately 140 minutes without commercials, which inevitably cut 30 minutes out of the original film. The film aired in its uncut form (minus the entr'acte) on April 9, 1995, on NBC. Julie Andrews hosted the four-hour telecast which presented the musical numbers in a letterboxed format. As the film's home video availability cut into its television ratings, NBC let their contract lapse in 2001. That year, the film was broadcast one time on the Fox network, in its heavily edited 140-minute version. Since 2002, the film has aired on ABC on a Sunday night prior to Christmas and has been broadcast on its sister cable network, Freeform, periodically around Easter and other holidays. Most of its more recent runs have been the full version in a four-hour time slot, complete with the entr'acte. ABC first broadcast a high-definition version on December 28, 2008. On December 22, 2013, the annual broadcast had its highest ratings since 2007; the increase in ratings were credited to NBC's broadcast of The Sound of Music Live!\u2014a live television adaptation of the original musical which aired earlier that month. In the United Kingdom, the film rights were acquired by the BBC, who paid a corporation record $4.1 million, and it was first aired on BBC One on 25 December 1978 and, as of December 2016, fifteen times since, mostly around Christmas time.

The film was also intended to be part of the BBC's programming during the outbreak of nuclear war. The film has been released on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD numerous times. The first DVD version was released on August 29, 2000, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the film's release. The film is often included in box sets with other Rodgers & Hammerstein film adaptations. A 40th anniversary DVD, with \"making of\" documentaries and special features, was released on November 15, 2005. The film made its debut issue on Blu-ray Disc on November 2, 2010, for its 45th anniversary. For the Blu-ray release, the original 70 mm negatives were rescanned at 8K resolution, then restored and remastered at 4K resolution for the transfer to Blu-ray, giving the most detailed copy of the film seen thus far. On March 10, 2015, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released The Sound of Music 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition\u2014a five-disc set featuring thirteen hours of bonus features, including a new documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg. A March 2015 episode of ABC's 20/20 entitled The Untold Story of the Sound of Music featured a preview of the documentary and interviews by Diane Sawyer. In part to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, the film was made available on the Disney+ streaming service upon its debut on November 12, 2019. The Sound of Music film adaptation, like the stage musical, presents a history of the von Trapp family (a.k.a. the Trapp Family) that is not completely accurate. The musical was based on the West German film The Trapp Family (1956) rather than Maria von Trapp's 1949 memoirs, as director Vincent J. Donehue had seen the film and decided that it would make a good vehicle for Mary Martin. The musical followed the film's plot so closely that the New York Times review of the West German film noticed that it \"strongly suggests 'The Sound of Music,' often scene by scene.\" The West German screenwriters made several significant changes to the family's story that were kept in the musical. Maria had been hired to teach just one child, but the 1956 film made her governess to all seven children. The 1965 film adaptation was influenced by other musicals of its era, such as Mary Poppins, the Rodgers and Hammerstein television production of Cinderella, and the stage production of Lerner and Loewe's Camelot (coincidentally all starring Julie Andrews). Screenwriter Ernest Lehman was inspired by the opening of West Side Story and saw the musical as \"a fairy tale that's almost real\". The film incorporated many \"fairy tale\" tropes which included the idyllic imagery (placed in the hills of Salzburg), the European villas, and the cross-class Cinderella-like romance between Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As Maria walks down the aisle to be married, the pageantry is explicitly both Guinevere and Cinderella. In keeping with this tone the filmmakers used artistic license to convey the essence and meaning of their story. Georg Ludwig von Trapp was indeed an anti-Nazi opposed to the Anschluss, and lived with his family in a villa in a district of Salzburg called Aigen. Their lifestyle depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living. The actual family villa, located at Traunstra\u00dfe 34, Aigen 5026, was large and comfortable but not nearly as grand as the mansion depicted in the film. The house was also not their ancestral home, as depicted in the film. The family had previously lived in homes in Zell Am See and Klosterneuburg after being forced to abandon their actual ancestral home in Pola following World War I. Georg moved the family to the Salzburg villa shortly after the death of his first wife, Agathe Whitehead, in 1922. Georg is referred to as \"Captain\" in the film, but he held a noble title of \"Ritter\" (hereditary knight), which had higher social status than a naval officer. Although Austrian nobility was legally abolished in 1919 and the nobiliary particle von was proscribed, both continued to be widely used unofficially as a matter of social courtesy. Georg was offered a position in the German Kriegsmarine; Nazi Germany was looking to expand its fleet of U-boats, and Corvette Captain von Trapp was the most successful Austro-Hungarian submarine commander of World War I, having sunk 11 Allied merchant ships totaling 47,653 GRT and two Allied warships displacing a total of 12,641 tons. With his family in desperate financial straits, he seriously considered the offer before deciding he could not serve a Nazi regime. In the film, Georg is depicted initially as a humorless, emotionally distant father. In reality, third child Maria Franziska von Trapp (\n\nquestion: Where were some scenes filmed in Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Aigen", "usage": 1140}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She has a different recollection of her stepmother, Maria Augusta Kutschera, whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage. In a 2003 interview, Maria remembered, \" had a terrible temper... and from one moment to the next, you didn't know what hit her. We were not used to this. But we took it like a thunderstorm that would pass, because the next minute she could be very nice.\" Maria Kutschera had indeed been a novice at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and had been hired by the von Trapp family. However, she was hired only to be a tutor to young Maria Franziska, who had come down with scarlet fever and needed her lessons at home, not to be a governess for all of the children. Maria and Georg married for practical reasons, rather than love and affection for each other. Georg needed a mother for his children, and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey. \"I really and truly was not in love,\" Maria wrote in her memoir, \"I liked him but didn't love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children. I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after.\" They were married in 1927, not in 1938 as depicted in the film, and the couple had been married for over a decade by the time of the Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time. Maria and Georg enjoyed a happy marriage. The von Trapp family lost most of its wealth during the worldwide depression of the early 1930s, when the Austrian national bank folded. In order to survive, the family dismissed the servants and began taking in boarders. They also started singing onstage to earn money, a fact that caused the proud Georg much embarrassment. In the film, the von Trapp family hike over the Alps from Austria to Switzerland to escape the Nazis, which would not have been possible; Salzburg is over two hundred miles from Switzerland. The von Trapp villa, however, was only a few kilometers from the Austria\u2013Germany border, and the final scene shows the family hiking on the Obersalzberg near the German town of Berchtesgaden, within sight of Adolf Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus Eagle's Nest retreat. In reality, the family simply walked to the local train station and boarded a train to Italy. The Trapps were entitled to Italian citizenship since Georg had been born in Zadar, Dalmatia, Austria-Hungary, which had been annexed by Italy after World War I. They were able to emigrate to the United States via the United Kingdom on their Italian passports. The fictional character Max Detweiler, who acted as the scheming family music director in the film, is based on the von Trapps' family priest, the Reverend Franz Wasner, who was their musical director for over twenty years and, unlike Max, accompanied them when they left Austria. The character of Friedrich, the second oldest child in the film version, was based on Rupert, the oldest of the real von Trapp children. Liesl, the oldest child in the film, was based on Agathe von Trapp, the second oldest in the real family. The names and ages of the children were changed, in part because the third child, who would be portrayed as \"Louisa\", was also named Maria, and producers thought that it would be confusing to have two characters called Maria in the film. The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers. Robert Wise met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to Richard Zanuck, that he was not making a \"documentary or realistic movie\" about her family, and that he would make the film with \"complete dramatic freedom\" in order to produce a \"fine and moving film\", one they could all be proud of. Although The Sound of Music is set in Salzburg, it was largely ignored in Austria upon release. The film adaptation was a blockbuster worldwide, but it ran for only three days in Salzburg movie theaters, with locals showing \"disdain\" for a film that \"wasn't authentic.\" In 1966, American Express created the first Sound of Music guided tour in Salzburg. Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been the leading Sound of Music bus tour company in the city, taking approximately 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region.

A German translation of the musical was performed on the national stage for the first time in 2005 at the Vienna Volksoper, receiving negative reviews from Austrian critics, who called it \"boring\" and referred to \"Edelweiss\" as \"an insult to Austrian musical creation.\" The musical finally premiered in Salzburg in 2011 at the Salzburger Landestheater, but Maria was played in the Salzburg premiere by a Dutch actress who \"grew up with the songs.\" However, most performances in Vienna and Salzburg were sold out, and the musical is now in both companies' repertoire. A Sing-along Sound of Music revival screening was first shown at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 1999, leading to a successful run at the Prince Charles Cinema which is ongoing as of 2018. During the screenings, audience members are often dressed as nuns and von Trapp children and are encouraged to sing along to lyrics superimposed on the screen. In July 2000, Sing-along Sound of Music shows opened in Boston, Massachusetts, and Austin, Texas. Some audience members dressed up as cast members and interacted with the action shown on the screen. The film began a successful run at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City in September 2000, with the opening attended by cast members Charmian Carr (Liesl), Daniel Truhitte (Rolfe), and Kym Karath (Gretl). Sing-along Sound of Music screenings have since become an international phenomenon. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".

Directed by the multiple Academy Award winning luminary Robert Wise (who also directed \u2018West Side Story\u2019), the film boasted the talents of Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and was phenomenal commercial success, managing to rake in three hundred million dollars way back in the 1960s. Today, the legacy of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is irreproachable, having five Academy Awards to its name and enduring renown that continues to make the film relevant even today. Based on the 1959 stage musical of the same name (which in turn is based on the memoir \u201cThe Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u201d by Maria von Trapp), \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 follows the von Trapp family and their new governess Maria. Maria is a struggling nun who is assigned the job of taking care of the exceedingly mischievous seven von Trapp children. Their father, Georg von Trapp, is a retired naval captain who runs his household with military discipline after the death of his wife. While initially cold and hostile towards Maria, the von Trapp children eventually fall for her kind demeanor and melodious personality. Even the stoic captain finds himself falling for Maria affable charms but their idyllic lifestyle is threatened when the Nazis start to take over their country. If you were wondering what were \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 filming locations, read on. The backdrop for much of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is the charming pre World War II town of Salzburg in Austria during the 1930s. The scenery shows off distant snow-capped mountain peaks, verdant hilltops perfect for breaking into a spontaneous melody, and cultured medieval buildings that occupy the imagination. While it is possible to recreate these distinctive features of the region on a set as well, such a facsimile is unlikely to be nearly as authentic as the real thing. This is especially true of the 1960s when CGI wasn\u2019t really an option for filmmakers. Keeping this in mind, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 was largely filmed on location in Austria itself, specifically in the city of Salzburg. Limited filming for scenes was also done in studio in California, as well as a few scenes in Bavaria, Germany. Principal filming commenced in late March 1964 and concluded later that year in September.

The production started out with the filming of Maria\u2019s bedroom scenes as well as the nun Abbey cloister. Sketch artist Maurice Zuberano accompanied director Robert Wise to scout for locations in Austria. After a ten week period, Zuberano prepared a set of storyboards and location photos to art director Boris Leven, who designed and constructed the interior sets at Fox Studios in painstaking detail. It is on these sets that parts of the gazebo scenes in the wildly popular songs \u201cSomething Good\u201d and \u201cSixteen Going on Seventeen\u201d were filmed. The 20th century Fox Studios have served as the filming location for many world renowned films and TV shows including \u2018Modern Family\u2019, \u2018Fight Club\u2019, \u2018Edward Scissorhands\u2019, and \u2018Arrested Development\u2019. The majority of the filming for \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 took place in and around the delightful city of Salzburg in Austria. The wedding scenes were filmed at the Benedictine monastery of Mondsee Abbey in Upper Austria, with on location filming also done at Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and the Altstadt Old Town area of Salzburg.

Each year hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Salzburg, Austria to walk in the footsteps of the legendary Von Trapp family. If you are a fan of the movie and wondering where the Sound of Music was filmed, you\u2019ve come to the right place. From the gazebo where Liesl sings \u201c16 going on 17\u201d to the Abbey where Maria lived and got married, here are all the must-visit Sound of Music filming locations. Recommendation: Relive the scenes of some of the most popular Sound of Music locations in Salzburg including Leopoldskron Palace, Nonnberg Abbey, and Mirabell Gardens on a guided Sound of Music tour. With an English speaking guide, and songs from the soundtrack playing throughout the tour, this Original Sound of Music tour from Salzburg won\u2019t disappoint! Marvel at the breathtaking locations for the Sound of Music and sing through the streets of Salzburg. Founded in 714 A.D., Nonnberg Abbey (German: Stift Nonnberg) is the oldest female convent north of the Alps and is where the real-life Maria became a novice nun and got married to Georg von Trapp. Nonnberg is where four scenes from the movie were filmed: the scene of the nuns singing \u201cMaria\u201d in the courtyard, Maria leaving the abbey, the kids visiting her at the abbey, and the Nazi\u2019s hunting the Von Trapps. Visitors will notice the interior of the Abbey is different from the movie, as filming inside the convent was not allowed, so the interior scenes were shot in a Hollywood studio. A highlight of this Sound of Music location in Salzburg is hearing the resident nuns Gregorian chants in Latin at 6:45 in the morning inside the beautiful Gothic abbey. The small yet beautiful flower filled St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery (German: Petersfriedhof) was the inspiration for the cemetery rebuilt on set for the scene towards the end of the movie in which the Von Trapps hide from the Nazis behind tombs. Beside being the resting place of Mozart\u2019s sister, Nannerl, this is also the resting place of Max Detweiler, \u201cUncle Max\u201d from the movie. This unique cemetery is one of the oldest (and most beautiful) cemeteries in the world and is Salzburg\u2019s oldest Christian cemetery. The catacombs carved out of the rocks of M\u00f6nchsberg provide a stunning view over the beautiful cemetery and should be visited during your Sound of Music tour in Salzburg. This baroque style garden, which was built in 1606 by the archbishop Wolf Dietrich for his mistress is a beautifully landscaped garden filled with gorgeous flowers, marble statues, fountains, and ample opportunities to reenact scenes from the movies. The iconic song, \u201cDo Re, Mi\u201d was partially shot here. While visiting Mirabell gardens, you\u2019ll relive the scene of Maria and the Von Trapp kids dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, jumping up and down the steps, as well as running through the hedge maze tunnel, all the while admiring the breathtaking view of Hohensalzburg Fortress in the distance. This film location spot, which can be visited for free, should not be missed. Situated in the center of Salzburg old town is Residence Square (German: Residenzplatz), which is home to the largest (45 feet tall) baroque fountain outside of Italy. It is in this square while singing \u201cI Have Confidence in Me\u201d, that Maria happily splashes water in the fountain, The Nazi soliders also march through the square later in the movie and hang their flag over the entrance of the old Residence Palace. Built in the 17th century to wash the horses of the prince-archbishop, the Horse Pond (German: Pferdeschwemme) was briefly featured in the movie as a backdrop to Maria and the kids singing \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d while dancing in their clothes made from curtains. In addition to being featured in the musical, the Horse Pond is well worth a visit in its own right. It is situation below the cliff side of M\u00f6nchsberg, and the bright fresco behind the horse pond makes for a gorgeous picture to add to your Sound of Music tour album. Carved into the M\u00f6nchsberg, the Rock Riding School (German: Felsenreitschule) was initially built to be a cathedral, but was later repurposed by the archbishop into a riding school where tournaments were held. Today it\u2019s Salzburg\u2019s most popular concert venue and is where the real Von Trapp family won the Sal\n\nquestion: What was the inspiration for the cemetery scene in the movie?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "St. Peter's Cemetery.", "usage": 1070}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Fans will recognize this Sound of Music filming location from the scene where the Captain sings \u201cEdelweiss\u201d and his family joins him on stage to sing \u201cSo Long, Farewell\u201d. Frohnburg Palace played an important role in the Sound of Music as it was one of the two filming locations for the Von Trapp Villa. Once a private residence, the palace is now a Music Academy, the facade and large iron gate is where Maria first set her eyes on the Von Trapp family home towards the end of the song \u201cI Have Confidence\u201d. The Palace was also featured in the movie during the scenes in which the Captain rips the Nazi flag from above the doorway and during the family\u2019s attempt to escape from the Nazis by pushing their car silently out of the gate. Just outside the city center is Hellbrunn Palace, home to the Sound of Music gazebo. It was here that the most romantic scenes of the Sound of Music was captured; when Liesl gets her first kiss while singing \u201c16 going on 17.\u201d It is also where the Captain and Maria fall deeper in love with each other while singing \u201cSomething Good\u201d. Though visitors cannot go into the gazebo, they can dance, sing, and take as many pictures as they please around it. Make your visit to Hellbrunn even more exciting by taking a tour of the Trick Fountains at Hellbrunn Palace. The hour long tour takes you through grottoes, ponds, and walkways filled with trick fountains. Your ticket also lets you explore the inside of the palace. This is one of the best things to do in Salzburg and will be a memorable experience especially for the kids. Leopoldskron Palace is one of the most important filming location for the Sound of Music as the majestic palace and perfect lake view backdrop served as the primary filming location for all of the lake terrace scenes of the Von Trapp family home. This includes the scenes in which Maria and the kids fall off the boat into the lake, and when the Captain and Uncle Max are drinking pink lemonade on the terrace. Though the interior of the mansion was never filmed in the movie, the palace\u2019s gold Venetian ballroom and foyer were rebuilt in Hollywood for the interior scenes. Today the palace is a boutique hotel. Staying overnight is the only way to visit the film location up close and to get a peek into the Venetian ballroom. Staying here is the ultimate Sound of Music experience as you get to live in the home of the Von Trapp family in the film. You can book your stay at Leopoldskron Palace here. If you choose not to stay at the hotel, you can still view the Palace at a distance from the west side of the lake. Though not a filming location, the Von Trapp Villa is where the real Von Trapp family lived for 15 years. They managed to get onto a train at the nearby station to escape the Nazis one day before the Austrian borders were closed. Today the Von Trapp Villa operates as a hotel and an educational Sound of Music museum of the real Von Trapp family as well as behind the scenes information about the filming of the movie. Not far from Leopoldskron Palace, a visit to the Von Trapp Villa would give fans a true insight on the life of the legendary Von Trapp family that we have come to love. Fans can either book a stay at the Villa or simply visit on a guided tour which takes place every day and lasts about 45 minutes. Mt. Untersberg is depicted twice in the Sound of Music, once during the opening scene in which Maria is singing the \u201cSound of Music\u201d and again when the family is escaping over the mountain to Switzerland while singing \u201cClimb Every Mountain\u201d. Fans can easily access Mount Untersberg from Salzburg via bus and get to the top via cable car. More adventurous travelers can hike 2 hours to the top. At 1,853 meters above the Salzburg basin, Mt. Untersberg offers breaktaking views over the region and is worth the day trip from Salzburg. Less than an hour bus drive from Salzburg is the picturesque lakeside town Mondsee. There you can visit the beautiful Collegiate Church of St. Michael where Maria and Georg von Trapp got married in the movie. This is a must-see for any Sound of Music fan. Make a full-day trip out of the location and stroll through the town, take a refreshing dip in the lake, hike up the nearby forest, and eat delicious seafood along the lake. In the opening scene of the movie you get a gorgeous aerial view of the village of St. Gilgen and the popular lake, Wolfgangsee. The village and lake can easily be reached by train. Want to have a picnic on the hills while singing \u201cDo Re Mi\n\nquestion: What was the inspiration for the cemetery scene in the movie?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1080}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The short 1.4km hike from the Werfen town takes about half an hour to complete. Once at the top you can enjoy a picnic and breathtaking views of the surrounding areas and the Hohenwerfen Fortress. Make your trip to Werfen a full day adventure by visiting both the Hohenwerfen Fortress and the largest ice cave in the world, Eisriesenwelt. Both sights will be a welcome addition to your Salzburg itinerary. Situated just across the German border, atop the magnificent Rossfeld mountain, is the Rossfeld Panoramic Road which was used in the movie to show the safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain. The private road, Rossfeld Panoramic Road is the only filming location that\u2019s difficult to get to without a car. If you don\u2019t have a car, it is recommended to visit the nearby Untersberg Mountain to get just as spectacular views with easier accessibility. Well there you have it, the top must-visit Sound of Music filming location in and around Salzburg. All locations can be visited on your own, but if you don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle or you have limited time, consider taking a guided Sound of Music tour from Salzburg or Vienna. And to make your Sound of Music trip even more memorable, spend a night or two at the home of the Von Trapp family in the film; Hotel Schloss Leopoldskron, or in the home of the real Von Trapp family at Villa Trapp. Either one will take your trip from amazing to extraordinary. Waseem says 1 month ago The Sound of Music gazebo at Hellbrunn Palace in Salzburg was moved here from its original location at Schloss Leopoldskron. Allan Trivette says 5 months ago The writer/compiler of this page shows an obvious love for the film. I was put under a \u201cSound of Music\u201d spell at the age of 10 when the film first came out, and I\u2019m still spellbound to this day. I\u2019ve visited Salzburg 5 times, and I can\u2019t wait to go back again. But, there are a few errors on this page that need to be clarified and/or corrected. First \u2013 #7 Frohnburg Palace \u2013 the writer of this article is correct \u2013 it WAS used as the von Trapp home in the film. However, what we see in the film as the FRONT of the von Trapp home is actually the BACK of Frohnburg! The FRONT of Frohnburg was used as the BACK of the von Trapp home in the film! The back of the home is seen when Rolf comes to deliver a telegram and the Captain takes it abruptly and tells him to leave. You see it also when the pink lemonade is served. Now, to make this even more complicated, the back of the film home looking toward the lake: the canoe flipping, the Baroness and the Captain strolling by the lake, Leisl running out to meet Rolf, Maria\u2019s return when she comes back from the Abbey, etc., is located to the left of Schloss Leopoldskron. I\u2019ll write more about this below. #8 \u2013 Hellbrun Palace (the gazebo) \u2013 correction \u2013 NONE of the gazebo scenes (\u201c16 Going on 17\u201d and \u201cSomething Good\u201d) were shot anywhere near the gazebo. It was a set in Hollywood. The only time we see the gazebo that is at Hellbrun is when the Captain and the Baroness take their stroll by the lake (just before the canoe flipping). It can be seen briefly in the background during their stroll. #9 \u2013 Leopoldskron Palace \u2013 was NOT used at ALL at any time during the filming!! The production company DID want to film the lake scenes there, but the officials of the Palace at that time wanted too much money. They did, however, offer the company the use of the \u201cside lawn\u201d. If you look at the photo of the Palace on this page, the side lawn is not seen, but it is to the left of the photo\u2019s edge. The \u201cOfficial Sound of Music Tour\u201d guides will show you the Schloss and point out the original horse-headed statues and lake gate and tell you that is where those scenes were filmed. WRONG!!! The \u201clake-gate\u201d and the horse-headed fish statues, were recreated by 20th Century-Fox and erected on the \u201cside lawn\u201d where the Meierhof is now located. The Meierhof used to be the administrative offices for the Palace, but it\n\nquestion: What was the inspiration for the cemetery scene in the movie?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1055}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If one enters the main gate for the Schloss, the Schloss is to the left and the Meierhof is to the right. Walking straight from the gate to the lake one will see the pedestals for the horse-headed statues are still there. As was stated by the writer, the Venetian Room is in the Schloss and was used as the inspiration for the ballroom in the film. #11 \u2013 Mount Untersberg \u2013 clarification \u2013 the mount is seen several times in the background of several scenes, but NO SCENES were filmed ON it. #15 \u2013 Rossfeld Mountain \u2013 clarification \u2013 again, \u201cthe safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain\u201d is inaccurate. That \u201cescape\u201d scene was filmed just off the Rossfeld Panoramastrasse. There is a roadside cafe/restaurant on the Panoramastrasse called the Ahornkaser (they serve the best Apple Strudel you\u2019ll ever have). Standing in front of the Ahornkaser, there is a path on the right side of the building. Take that path about 400 feet and look up to your right. At the top of the hill is the exact spot where the von Trapps cross the mountain to freedom as \u201cClimb Ev\u2019ry Mountain\u201d is sung. At the end of that scene, with that open vista lying before them, you can see the Untersberg in the distance. I hope this helps/informs anyone planning on making a visit. Negar Modgeddi says 1 month ago I LOVE your notations about the actual places and your very thoughtful corrections! Melanie says 6 months ago Thank you for this great information! Do you know which field Maria was walking in during the opening scene? I know it was Untersberg Mountain in the background, but I can\u2019t find any information on the field she was frolicking through to get that sweeping view. Any pointers you can offer would be most appreciated! Ben says 6 months ago The opening scene was filmed on Mehlweg meadow which is not open to the public. Frans says 2 years ago The horsepond also features in a scene where Liesl runs into Rolf on his bike. lucy says 2 years ago This has been the most helpful and clear information i\u2019ve found about the filming locations thanks so much Your email address will not be published.

The opening aerial shots are Salzburg\u2019s glorious Lake District, the Salzkammergut. The castles you can see are Kloster H\u00f6glw\u00f6rth, an old monastery on a peninsula in H\u00f6glw\u00f6rther See; and Schloss Anif, off E55 a few miles south of Salzburg. The mountain, atop which Maria (Julie Andrews) makes her first twirling appearance, is Mehlweg, near the Bavarian village of Markt Schellenberg, about six miles from Salzburg. Don\u2019t be too disappointed \u2013 the birch trees and the babbling brook were added for the movie. Convent interiors were recreated in the studio, but the exterior really is Maria\u2019s abbey. It\u2019s Nonnberg Abbey, Nonnberg Gasse, where you can visit the courtyard and peek inside the chapel (which looks nothing like the interior recreated back in Hollywood). The film cheats a little with the exterior, too. As you\u2019ll find if you visit, the real Nonnberg Abbey doesn\u2019t look out over the picturesque old town of Salzburg, but to the nondescript southern suburbs. The reverse shot, of Maria leaving the abbey, filmed way across the city on the Humboldt Terrace (seen later in the Do Re Mi number), in front of the Museum of Modern Art, which since 2002 has stood atop M\u00f6nchsberg Cliffs on the site of the old Cafe Winkler. As Maria leaves to take up her post with the Von Trapp family, I Have Confidence in Me was filmed in Salzburg\u2019s Old Town, in the Residenzplatz, where you\u2019ll see the Domplatz arches, through which Maria enters, and the Residenz Fountain, in which she splashes. The \u2018Villa Von Trapp\u2019 is a combination of two different Salzburg locations. The tree-shaded lane, where Maria alights from the bus, is Hellbrunner Allee, running south from the old town. Here you\u2019ll recognise Schloss Frohnburg, a 17th century country house, now the Mozarteum Music Academy, which was used for the intimidating gates and front entrance of the villa which Maria nervously approaches. The lakeside terrace, though, was filmed at Schloss Leopoldskron, a rococo castle on Leopoldskroner Teich, a small artificial lake on the southwest of the town. You can view Leopoldskron across the lake from K\u00f6nig Ludwig Strasse, but it's now \u2013 hurrah! \u2013 a hotel. Leopoldskron's extravagantly gilt Venetian Room was replicated in the studio in Hollywood. Incidentally, the famous gazebo originally stood on the palace's grounds, when it was a private villa, but was moved to a more accessible location. The real Villa Trapp, by the way, is in Aigen, a suburb just to the southeast of the Old Town of Salzburg. Since 2008, it\u2019s been open as a hotel, Villa Trapp, Traunstra\u00dfe 34, 5026 Salzburg. There\u2019s a rail service to Bahnhof Aigen. The little footbridge over which the von Trapps skip at the beginning of the My Favourite Things montage of Salzburg is Mozart Steg, north of Mozart Platz. They quickly move on to Domplatz, in front of Salzburger Dom (Salzburg Cathedral); Kapitelschwemme, the Baroque horse pond once used for watering and cleaning horses, in Herbert von Karajan Platz; and the market on Kajetanerplatz, just north of Nonnberg Abbey, where Maria demonstrates her tomato juggling skills. They finally head off for a picnic in the meadow above the village of Werfen, 25 miles south of Salzburg in the Salzach River valley (where you can also visit the castle from wartime action movie Where Eagles Dare). Do-Re-Mi begins at the picnic, returning to Salzburg atop the Monchsberg Cliffs, on Humboldt Terrace which you can reach from the Monchsberg elevator in Anton Neumayrplatz, at the end of the Gstattengasse shopping street, and continuing with a carriage ride south from St Erhard Kirche, the Parish Church of St Erhard, along Nonntaler Hauptstra\u00dfe,\n\nquestion: What was the inspiration for the cemetery scene in the movie?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1040}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The number climaxes at Mirabell Gardens, on Schwarzstrasse, over the Salzach River behind Schloss Mirabell, where you\u2019ll find the fountains, statues and, famously, the flight of steps on which the children hop. The Von Trapp gazebo, used for Sixteen Going On Seventeen, once stood in the grounds of Leopoldskron, but constant trespassing resulted in it being moved and reconstructed in the ornamental gardens of Schloss Hellbrunn, Morzger Strasse, toward the south of Salzburg. And another cheat. It was recreated, slightly larger, back at 20th Century-Fox in Hollywood for the interior shots. Maria\u2019s wedding, which took place in Nonnberg Abbey, was filmed in the baroque, twin-towered St Michael\u2019s Church, Wredeplatz, in Mondsee, about 15 miles east of Salzburg on the E55/E60. The Anschluss scene, Austria\u2019s enforced unity with Nazi Germany, was staged back in the centre of Salzburg itself in Residenzplatz. The music festival, at which the von Trapp family perform their disappearing act, is at the Felsenreitschule (\u2018Rock Riding School\u2019), Hofstallgasse 1, a 1400-seat theatre built in what was a rock quarry for Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun in 1693, and used as the archbishop's riding school. It\u2019s one of the sites of the Salzburg Festival. Despite what some overenthusiastic tour guides might tell you, the cemetery in which the von Trapps hide from the Nazis is a Hollywood studio set, though its design is clearly based on St Peter\u2019s Graveyard, which you can see just off Kapitelplatz. The mountain over which the family finally escapes to freedom is above the village of Obersalzburg with views of the Untersberg in the distance, near the village of Rossfeld, on the 319, 12 miles south of Salzburg. \u2022 Many thanks to Lieselotte Mayrhofer; and to Bryan Crawford of Edelweiss Tours for help with this section.

Adapted from the 1959 stage musical of the same name, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is actually based on the memoir, titled \u2018The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u2019. The story deals with a postulant, who goes to the imposing home of a retired naval officer. The man is a widower, and the young woman acts as a governess to his children. Soon enough, she brings music and love to the entire family, and it is not long before she falls in love with her employer as well. Together they band, as they have to face the loss of their motherland to the Nazis. If you have seen the movie, you already know that it takes place in Salzburg in Austria. Over the course of the film, there are several iconic scenes that have been shot at picturesque locations, or there are some locations that have been simply elevated due to the value of the scene itself (think of the gazebo where \u2018Sixteen Going on Seventeen\u2019 is performed). Naturally, you might be wondering about the exact filming locations of this popular movie, and we have got you covered in that regard. When \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 started filming, the crew did not head immediately to the real locations for the movie. Instead, when principal photography began on March 26, 1964, it started at the 20th Century Fox studios located in Los Angeles. Following this, the crew headed to Salzburg, where they filmed at a variety of locations including the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and Residence Fountain, among others. Filming commenced here from April 23, to around May 22. Various other locations nearby were used, and shooting went on till around June 19. The crew also hit up places nearby including Werfen in the Salzach River valley. Some scenes were also shot in Bavaria, with the Alps serving as a wonderful backdrop. Around July 6, the team headed back to Los Angeles for the remaining scenes, and principal photography ultimately wrapped up by September 1, 1964. As is evident, a plethora of locations have been hit in this frenzied shooting schedule, and we now proceed to the specific filming locations, rendered memorable by the iconic scenes that have unfolded there. Salzburg in Austria serves as the place where most of the pivotal scenes of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place. Some of the most recognizable locations include Mirabell Palace and Gardens. If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you must know that \u2018Do re mi\u2019 is one of the most popular songs. The ending of this song sees Maria and the von Trapp kids at the Mirabell Palace and Gardens. Located in Salzburg\u2019s old town, we can see the movie characters dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, which is located in front of the palace. The other recognizable locations happen to be the rose garden at the north of the fountain and the Greek fencing statues at the entrance. Residenzplatz Square and Fountain also plays an important part, early on, as Maria can be seen splashing in the baroque horse fountain here, while \u2018I Have Confidence in Me\u2019 is playing. When Germany annexes Austria, we see Nazi soldiers marching through this square, while a Swastika flag is raised above the Old Residence Palace\u2019s entrance. The Summer Riding School (Felsenreitschule) is where the von Trapp family takes the stage, performing \u2018Edelweiss\u2019 and \u2018So long, Farewell\u2019, for the Folk Festival. Notably, hundreds of extras were hired for the scene to sing along. A little away from this location, on Herbert von Karajan Square, is the Horse Pond, where Maria and the children dance at the end of \u2018My Favorite Things\u2019. Leopoldskron Palace is important in its own way since all the lake terrace scenes of the von Trapp family home were shot here. Schloss Frohnburg was also used to show the von Trapp house, rather the intimidating front gates which Maria nervously approaches initially. Nonnberg Abbey Convent is where Maria lived, and the exteriors of the same have been used in the movie. However, the movie has taken some liberties here, as the convent does not actually look over the old town of Salzburg, but instead has a view of the nondescript southern suburbs. St. Michael Basilica in Mondsee, outside Salzburg, is remarkable because Maria gets married to Georg von Trapp, in one of the most famous scenes from the movie. Werfen, which is around a 40-minute drive away from Salzburg, has the Gschwandtanger Meadow, which\n\nquestion: What was the inspiration for the cemetery scene in the movie?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1083}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Bavaria is important for being one of the first scenes where Maria makes her entrance. She can be seen twirling at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg. The sequence where the von Trapps escape the Nazis is also shot on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. Notably, Stage 8 and Stage 15 were used in the studios, but a lot of important scenes were shot there. Firstly, shooting inside the convent was not allowed, meaning that the set was created in the studio itself. The golden foyer and the ballroom, we see in the house, were also recreated in Hollywood. There is an important scene where the Von Trapp family hides from the Nazis behind some tombs. While the scenes have been recreated in Hollywood, they closely resemble St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery and Catacombs in Salzburg. The gazebo where two of the finest songs in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place, that is, \u2018Something Good\u2019 and \u201916 going on 17\u2032, is actually both a real-life location as well as something created in a studio. The real-life gazebo is near the Eastern entrance to the Hellbrunn Palace. A larger one was rebuilt in Hollywood where most of the scenes were actually shot. As is evident, the scenes in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 have been carefully shot to capture the beauty of the location and to transport us into this enchanting world inhabited by the von Trapp family and Maria. Making the best use of the locations is just one small aspect that has helped this film go down in history as one of the most memorable examples of great cinema.

The film is an adaptation of the 1959 stage musical, composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and a book by Lindsay and Crouse. Based on the 1949 memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria von Trapp, the film is set in Salzburg, Austria and is a fictional retelling of her experiences as governess to seven children, her eventual marriage with their father Captain Georg Von Trapp, and their escape during the Anschluss in 1938. Filming took place from March to September 1964 in Los Angeles and Salzburg. The Sound of Music was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited roadshow theatrical release. Although initial critical response to the film was mixed, it was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office film after four weeks, and the highest-grossing film of 1965. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all-time\u2014surpassing Gone with the Wind\u2014and held that distinction for five years. The film was just as popular throughout the world, breaking previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries. Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years, and two successful re-releases, the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286 million. The Sound of Music received five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Wise's second pair of both awards, the first being from the 1961 film West Side Story. The film also received two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture and Best Actress, the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. In 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) listed The Sound of Music as the fifty-fifth greatest American film of all time, and the fourth-greatest film musical. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg in 1938. Her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern. Mother Abbess sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children\u2014Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children out of drapes that are to be changed. She takes them around Salzburg and the mountains while teaching them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake which concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain attempts to fire Maria. However, he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. The Captain apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay. Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes that he enters them in the upcoming Salzburg Festival, but the Captain disapproves of letting his children sing in public. During a grand party at the villa, where guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional L\u00e4ndler folk dance, he steps in and partners Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy by indirectly convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. However, Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, so she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her purpose in life. When Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. However, the Baroness learns that the Captain's feelings\n\nquestion: What was the inspiration for the cemetery scene in the movie?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1123}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

While the couple is on their honeymoon, Max enters the children into the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. Having learned that Austria has been annexed by the Third Reich, the couple return to their home, where the Captain receives a telegram, ordering him to report to the German Naval base at Bremerhaven to accept a commission in the Kriegsmarine. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and their ideology, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. That night, the von Trapp family attempt to flee to Switzerland, but they are stopped by a group of Brownshirts, led by the Gauleiter Hans Zeller, waiting outside the villa. To cover his family's tracks, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven. Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slips away and seeks shelter at the abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Zeller and his men soon arrive and search the abbey, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When they attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start, as two of the nuns have sabotaged their engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom. The real Maria von Trapp has a brief uncredited cameo as a passerby, alongside her children Rosmarie and Werner von Trapp during \"I Have Confidence\". The Sound of Music story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, published in 1949 to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband Georg in 1947. Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told. In 1956, German producer Wolfgang Liebeneiner purchased the film rights for $9,000 (equivalent to $97,000 in 2022), hired George Hurdalek and Herbert Reinecker to write the screenplay, and Franz Grothe to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional Austrian folk songs. The Trapp Family was released in West Germany on October 9, 1956, and became a major success. Two years later, Liebeneiner directed a sequel, The Trapp Family in America, and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years. Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America. In 1956, Paramount Pictures purchased the United States film rights, intending to produce an English-language version with Audrey Hepburn as Maria. The studio eventually dropped its option, but one of its directors, Vincent J. Donehue, proposed the story as a stage musical for Mary Martin. Producers Richard Halliday and Leland Heyward secured the rights and hired playwrights Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, who had won the Pulitzer Prize for State of the Union. They approached Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II to compose one song for the musical, but the composers felt the two styles\u2014traditional Austrian folk songs and their composition\u2014would not work together. They offered to write a completely new score for the entire production if the producers were willing to wait while they completed work on Flower Drum Song. The producers quickly responded that they would wait as long as necessary. The Sound of Music stage musical opened on November 16, 1959, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York City and ran on Broadway for 1,443 performances, winning six Tony Awards, including Best Musical. In June 1960, Twentieth Century-Fox purchased the film adaptation rights to the stage musical for $1.25 million (equivalent to $12,400,000 in 2022) against ten percent of the gross. In December 1962, 20th Century-Fox president Richard D. Zanuck hired Ernest Lehman to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of the stage musical. Lehman reviewed the original script for the stage musical, rearranged the sequence of songs, and began transforming a work designed for the stage into a film that could use the camera to emphasize action and mood and open the story up to the beautiful locations of Salzburg and the Austrian Alps. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" sequence in the play, for example, was originally a stagnant number; Lehman transformed it into a lively montage showing some of the beautiful sites of Salzburg, as well as showing Maria and the children growing closer over time. Lehman also eliminated two songs, \"How Can Love Survive?\" and \"No Way to Stop It\", sung by the characters of Elsa and Max. In January 1963, he saw the Fox English-d\n\nquestion: What was the inspiration for the cemetery scene in the movie?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1131}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material. While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director. Their first choice was Robert Wise, with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of West Side Story, but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, The Sand Pebbles. Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including Stanley Donen, Vincent J. Donehue, George Roy Hill, and Gene Kelly. In January 1963, Lehman invited one of his favorite directors, William Wyler, to travel to New York City with him to see the Broadway musical. After seeing the show, Wyler said he hated it, but after two weeks of Lehman's persuasion, Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film. After hiring musical supervisor Roger Edens, Wyler, Lehman, and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations. In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy-five locations\u2014an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences. During that trip, Lehman began to have reservations about Wyler's commitment to the project and communicated this to Zanuck, who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible. Lehman completed the first draft on September 10, 1963, and sent it to Wyler, who had no suggestions or changes to add. At that time, Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise, whom Lehman still wanted as the director. Later that month, Wyler's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct The Collector. Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film, and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director, ending Wyler's participation. Meanwhile, Wise, whose film The Sand Pebbles had been postponed, read Lehman's first draft, was impressed by what he read, and agreed to direct the film, joining the picture in October 1963, and flew to Salzburg with associate producer Saul Chaplin and members of his production team to scout filming locations, including many that Wyler had identified. When he returned, Wise began working on the script. Wise shared Lehman's vision of the film being centered on the music, and the changes he made were consistent with the writer's approach\u2014mainly reducing the amount of sweetness and sentimentality found in the stage musical. He had reservations about Lehman's opening aerial sequence because West Side Story, whose screenplay Lehman had also written, had used a similar opening sequence, but he was unable to think of a better one and decided to keep Lehman's. Other changes included replacing \"An Ordinary Couple\" with a more romantic number, and a new song for Maria's departure from the abbey\u2014Rodgers provided \"Something Good\" and \"I Have Confidence\", especially for the film. Lehman completed the second draft on December 20, 1963, but additional changes would be made based on input from Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer about the character of the Captain. Plummer especially helped change a character lacking substance into a stronger, more forceful complex figure with a wry sense of humor and a darker edge. Lehman completed his final draft on March 20, 1964. Lehman's first and only choice for Maria was Julie Andrews. When Wise joined the project, he made a list of his choices for the role, which included Andrews as his first choice, Grace Kelly, and Shirley Jones. Wise and Lehman went to Disney Studios to view footage from Mary Poppins, which was not yet released. A few minutes into the film, Wise told Lehman, \"Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this film and grabs her!\" Andrews had some reservations\u2014mainly about the amount of sweetness in the theatrical version\u2014but when she learned that her concerns were shared by Wise and Lehman and what their vision was, she signed a contract with Fox to star in The Sound of Music and one other film for $225,000 (equivalent to $2,120,000 in 2022). Wise had a more difficult time casting the role of the Captain. A number of actors were considered for the part, including Bing Crosby, Yul Brynner, Sean Connery, and Richard Burton. Wise had seen Christopher Plummer on Broadway and wanted him for the role, but the stage actor turned down the offer several times. Wise flew to London to meet with Plummer and explained his concept of the film; the actor accepted after being assured that he could work with Lehman to improve the character. Wise also spent considerable time and effort on casting the secondary characters. For the role of Max Detweiler, Wise initially considered Victor Borge, No\u00ebl Coward, and Hal Holbrook among others before deciding on Richard Haydn. For the character of Baroness Elsa Schraeder\n\nquestion: What was the inspiration for the cemetery scene in the movie?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1125}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Filming Locations of \"The Sound of Music\" in Austria and California\n\nevidence: , Wise looked for a \"name\" actress\u2014Andrews and Plummer were not yet widely known to film audiences\u2014and decided on Eleanor Parker. The casting of the children's characters began in November 1963 and involved over two hundred interviews and auditions throughout the United States and England. Some of the child actors interviewed or tested, who were not selected, included Mia Farrow, Patty Duke, Lesley Ann Warren, Geraldine Chaplin, Shelley Fabares, Teri Garr, Kurt Russell, and The Osmonds. Most of the actors selected had some acting, singing, or dancing experience. Charmian Carr, however, was a model who worked part-time in a doctor's office and had no ambition to pursue a career as an actress. After a friend sent her photo to Wise's office, she was asked to interview. Wise later recalled, \"She was so pretty and had such poise and charm that we liked her immediately.\" The last person to be cast was Daniel Truhitte in the role of Rolfe. Rehearsals for the singing and dance sequences began on February 10, 1964. The husband-and-wife team of Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, who had worked with Andrews on Mary Poppins, worked out the choreography with Saul Chaplin on piano\u2014the arrangements could not be altered under Rodgers and Hammerstein's contract. The stage choreography was not used because it was too restrictive. Breaux and Wood worked out all-new choreography better suited for the film that incorporated many of the Salzburg locations and settings. They even choreographed the newly added puppet dance sequence for \"The Lonely Goatherd\". The choreography for the L\u00e4ndler strictly followed the traditional Austrian folk dance. The musical arranger Irwin Kostal prerecorded the songs with a large orchestra and singers on a stage before the start of filming. In her book, The Sound of Music: The Making of America's Favorite Movie, Julia Antopol Hirsch says that Kostal used seven children and five adults to record the children's voices; the only scene in which the child-actors' singing is heard in the released version of the film is when they sing \"The Sound of Music\" on their own after Maria leaves. Charmian Carr refuted the claim that the voices of the child actors were dubbed in the film and on the soundtrack. Carr contended that all of the children who are in the film sing on the track, but four other children were added to most of the songs to give them a fuller sound; they did not replace them as singers. The voices of some of the adult actors had voice doubles, including those of Peggy Wood and Christopher Plummer. Principal photography began on March 26, 1964, at 20th Century-Fox studios in Los Angeles, where scenes from Maria's bedroom and the abbey cloister and graveyard were filmed. The company then flew to Salzburg, where filming resumed on April 23 at Mondsee Abbey for the wedding scenes. From April 25 through May 22, scenes were filmed at the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, Residence Fountain, and various street locations throughout the Altstadt (Old Town) area of the city. Wise faced opposition from city leaders who did not want him staging scenes with swastika banners. They relented after he threatened instead to include old newsreel footage featuring the banners. On days when it rained, a constant challenge for the company, Wise arranged for scenes to be shot at St. Margarethen Chapel and D\u00fcrer Studios (Reverend Mother's office). From May 23 to June 7, the company worked at Schloss Leopoldskron and an adjacent property called Bertelsmann for scenes representing the lakeside terrace and gardens of the von Trapp villa. From June 9 to 19, scenes were shot at Frohnburg Palace, which represented the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa. Karath could not swim and was in danger during the capsizing boat scene. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" picnic scene in the mountains was filmed above the town of Werfen in the Salzach River valley on June 25 and 27. The opening sequence of Maria on her mountain was filmed from June 28 to July 2 at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg in Bavaria. During filming, Birch trees were added and then removed. The brook she walks through was plastic filled with water which was put there during filming. The final scene of the von Trapp family escaping over the mountains was filmed on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. The cast and crew flew back to Los Angeles and resumed filming at Fox Studios on July 6 for all remaining scenes, including those in the villa dining room, ballroom, terrace, living room, and gazebo. Following the last two scenes shot in the gazebo\u2014for the songs \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Sevent\n\nquestion: What was the inspiration for the cemetery scene in the movie?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1121}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A total of eighty-three scenes were filmed in just over five months. Post-production work began on August 25 with three weeks of dialogue dubbing to correct lines that were ruined by various street noises and rain. In October, Christopher Plummer's singing voice was dubbed by veteran Disney playback singer Bill Lee. The film was then edited by Wise and film editor William Reynolds. Once the film was edited, Irwin Kostal, who orchestrated the musical numbers, underscored the film with background music consisting of variations on Rodgers and Hammerstein's original songs to amplify or add nuances to the visual images. When dubbing, editing, and scoring were complete, Wise arranged for two sneak-preview showings\u2014the first one held in Minneapolis on Friday, January 15, 1965 at the Mann Theater, and the second one held the following night in Tulsa. Despite the \"sensational\" responses from the preview audiences, Wise made a few final editing changes before completing the film. According to the original print information for the film, the running time for the theatrical release version was 174 minutes. The film was still in release when the Motion Picture Association of America's film ratings system was implemented in 1968, and was subsequently given a \"G\" rating (\"general audiences\") in 1969. The Sound of Music was filmed in Todd-AO by Ted McCord and produced with DeLuxe Color processing. Aerial footage was photographed with an MCS-70 camera. The sound was recorded on a 70 mm six-track using a Westrex recording system. The sets used for the film were based on the storyboards of sketch artist Maurice Zuberano, who accompanied Wise to Austria to scout filming locations in November 1963. Wise met with the artist over ten weeks and explained his objective for each scene\u2014the feeling he wanted to convey and the visual images he wanted to use. When Zuberano was finished, he provided Wise with a complete set of storyboards that illustrated each scene and set\u2014storyboards the director used as guidance during filming. Zuberano's storyboards and location photos were also used by art director Boris Leven to design and construct all of the original interior sets at Fox studios, as well as some external sets in Salzburg. The von Trapp villa, for example, was actually filmed in several locations: the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa were filmed at Frohnburg Palace, the lakeside terrace and gardens was a set constructed on a property adjacent to Schloss Leopoldskron called Bertelsmann, and the interior was a constructed set at Fox Studios. The gazebo scenes for \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" were filmed on a larger reconstructed set at Fox studios, while some shots of the original gazebo were filmed on the grounds at Schloss Leopoldskron in Salzburg. Most of the soundtrack to The Sound of Music was written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and arranged and conducted by Irwin Kostal, who also adapted the instrumental underscore passages. Both the lyrics and music for two new songs were written by Rodgers, as Hammerstein died in 1960. The soundtrack album was released by RCA Victor in 1965 and is one of the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 20 million copies worldwide. The album reached the number one position on the Billboard 200 that year in the United States. It remained in the top ten for 109 weeks, from May 1, 1965, to July 16, 1967, and remained on the Billboard 200 chart for 238 weeks. The album was the best-selling album in the United Kingdom in 1965, 1966, and 1968 and the second best-selling of the entire decade, spending a total of 70 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It also stayed 73 weeks on the Norwegian charts, becoming the seventh best-charting album of all time in that country. In 2015, Billboard named the album the second greatest album of all time. The album has been reissued several times, including anniversary editions with additional tracks in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Wise hired Mike Kaplan to direct the publicity campaign for the film. After reading the script, Kaplan decided on the ad line \"The Happiest Sound in All the World\", which would appear on promotional material and artwork. Kaplan also brought in outside agencies to work with the studio's advertising department to develop the promotional artwork, eventually selecting a painting by Howard Terpning of Andrews on an alpine meadow with her carpetbag and guitar case in hand with the children and Plummer in the background. In February 1964, Kaplan began placing ads in the trade papers Daily Variety, Weekly Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter to attract future exhibitor interest in the project. The studio intended the film to have an initial roadshow theatrical release in select large cities in theaters that could accommodate the 70-mm screenings and six-track stereophonic sound.

Kaplan identified forty key cities that would likely be included in the roadshow release and developed a promotional strategy targeting the major newspapers of those cities. During the Salzburg production phase, 20th Century-Fox organized press junkets for American journalists to interview Wise and his team and the cast members. \"No one is comfortable with an excess of hearts and flowers, but there is no valid reason for hiding honest emotion. This has always been a major element in the theatre, and it's my conviction that anyone who can't, on occasion, be sentimental about children, home or nature is sadly maladjusted.\" Richard Rodgers The film had its opening premiere on March 2, 1965, at the Rivoli Theater in New York City. Initial reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's \"romantic nonsense and sentiment\", the children's \"artificial roles\", and Robert Wise's \"cosy-cum-corny\" direction. Judith Crist, in a biting review in the New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as \"icky sticky\" and designed for \"the five to seven set and their mommies\". In her review for McCall's magazine, Pauline Kael called the film \"the sugar-coated lie people seem to want to eat\", and that audiences have \"turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs.\" Wise later recalled, \"The East Coast, intellectual papers and magazines destroyed us, but the local papers and the trades gave us great reviews\". Indeed, reviewers such as Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \"three hours of visual and vocal brilliance\", and Variety called it \"a warmly-pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast\". The \"wildly mixed film reviews\" reflected the critical response to the stage musical, according to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical. After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10, The Sound of Music opened in 131 theaters in the United States, including a limited number of roadshow events. After four weeks, the film became the number one box office movie in the country and held that position for thirty out of the next forty-three weeks in 1965. The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years. A few months after its United States release, The Sound of Music opened in 261 theaters in other countries, the first American movie to be completely dubbed in a foreign language, both dialogue, and music. The German, French, Italian, and Spanish versions were completely dubbed, the Japanese version had Japanese dialogue with English songs, and other versions were released with foreign subtitles. The film was a popular success in every country it opened, except the two countries where the story originated, Austria and Germany. In these two countries, the film had to compete with the much-loved Die Trapp-Familie (1956), which provided the original inspiration for the Broadway musical, and its sequel Die Trapp-Familie in Amerika (1958); both films are still widely popular in German-speaking Europe and considered the authoritative von Trapp story. Austrians took exception to the liberties taken by the filmmakers with regard to the costumes, which did not reflect the traditional style and the replacement of traditional Austrian folk songs with Broadway show tunes. The film's Nazi theme was especially unpopular in Germany, where the Munich branch manager for 20th Century-Fox approved the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act of the film following the wedding sequence\u2014the scenes showing Salzburg following the Anschluss. Robert Wise and the studio intervened, the original film was restored, and the branch manager was fired. The Sound of Music holds an 84% \"Certified Fresh\" score on Rotten Tomatoes based on seventy-four reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's consensus states: \"Unapologetically sweet and maybe even a little corny, The Sound of Music will win over all but the most cynical filmgoers with its classic songs and irresistible warmth.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on eleven critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The Sound of Music is one of the most commercially successful films of all time. Four weeks after its theatrical release, it became the number one box office movie in the United States, from revenue generated by twenty-five theaters, each screening only ten roadshow performances per week. It held the number one position for thirty of the next forty-three weeks, and ended up the highest-grossing film of 1965. One contributing factor in the film's early commercial success was the repeat business of many filmgoers. In some cities in the United States, the number of tickets sold exceeded the total population.

It was also a major success in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, where it played for as long as two years at some theaters. It was not a universal success, however, with the film only enjoying modest success in France and it was a flop in Germany. It also initially performed poorly in Italy, but a re-release after the Oscars brought better results. It was number one at the US box office for a further 11 weeks in 1966, for a total of 41 weeks at number one. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all time, with over $67.5 million in worldwide rentals ($125 million in gross receipts), surpassing Gone with the Wind, which held that distinction for twenty-four years. It was still in the top ten at the US box office in its 100th week of release. The Sound of Music completed its initial four-and-a-half year theatrical release run in the United States on Labor Day 1969, the longest initial run for a film in the US, having earned $68,313,000 in rentals in the United States and Canada. It played for 142 weeks at the Eglinton Theatre in Toronto. It was the first film to gross over $100 million. By December 1970, it had earned $121.5 million in worldwide rentals, which was over four times higher than the film's estimated break-even point of $29.5 million in rentals. The film was re-released in 1973, and increased its North American rentals to $78.4 million. By the end of the 1970s, it was ranked seventh in all-time North American rentals, having earned $79 million. The film's re-release in 1990 increased the total North American admissions to 142,415,400\u2014the third-highest number of tickets sold behind Gone with the Wind and Star Wars\u2014and about 283.3 million admissions worldwide. The Sound of Music eventually earned a total domestic gross of $163,214,076 and a total worldwide gross of $286,214,076. Adjusted for inflation, the film earned about $2.366 billion at 2014 prices\u2014placing it among the top ten highest-grossing films of all time. The Sound of Music has been included in numerous top film lists from the American Film Institute. The first American television transmission of The Sound of Music was on February 29, 1976, on ABC, which paid $15 million (equivalent to $77,140,351 in 2022) for a one-time only broadcast that became one of the top 20 rated films shown on television to that point with a Nielsen rating of 33.6 and an audience share of 49%. The movie was not shown again until NBC acquired the broadcast rights in June 1977 for $21.5 million for 20 showings over 22 years and telecast the film on February 11, 1979. NBC continued to air the film annually for twenty years. During most of its run on NBC, the film was heavily edited to fit a three-hour time slot\u2014approximately 140 minutes without commercials, which inevitably cut 30 minutes out of the original film. The film aired in its uncut form (minus the entr'acte) on April 9, 1995, on NBC. Julie Andrews hosted the four-hour telecast which presented the musical numbers in a letterboxed format. As the film's home video availability cut into its television ratings, NBC let their contract lapse in 2001. That year, the film was broadcast one time on the Fox network, in its heavily edited 140-minute version. Since 2002, the film has aired on ABC on a Sunday night prior to Christmas and has been broadcast on its sister cable network, Freeform, periodically around Easter and other holidays. Most of its more recent runs have been the full version in a four-hour time slot, complete with the entr'acte. ABC first broadcast a high-definition version on December 28, 2008. On December 22, 2013, the annual broadcast had its highest ratings since 2007; the increase in ratings were credited to NBC's broadcast of The Sound of Music Live!\u2014a live television adaptation of the original musical which aired earlier that month. In the United Kingdom, the film rights were acquired by the BBC, who paid a corporation record $4.1 million, and it was first aired on BBC One on 25 December 1978 and, as of December 2016, fifteen times since, mostly around Christmas time. As the BBC channels in Britain are not funded by advertising there was no need to cut scenes to fit within a timeslot and the\n\nquestion: What was the inspiration for the cemetery scene in the movie?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1155}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The film was also intended to be part of the BBC's programming during the outbreak of nuclear war. The film has been released on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD numerous times. The first DVD version was released on August 29, 2000, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the film's release. The film is often included in box sets with other Rodgers & Hammerstein film adaptations. A 40th anniversary DVD, with \"making of\" documentaries and special features, was released on November 15, 2005. The film made its debut issue on Blu-ray Disc on November 2, 2010, for its 45th anniversary. For the Blu-ray release, the original 70 mm negatives were rescanned at 8K resolution, then restored and remastered at 4K resolution for the transfer to Blu-ray, giving the most detailed copy of the film seen thus far. On March 10, 2015, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released The Sound of Music 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition\u2014a five-disc set featuring thirteen hours of bonus features, including a new documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg. A March 2015 episode of ABC's 20/20 entitled The Untold Story of the Sound of Music featured a preview of the documentary and interviews by Diane Sawyer. In part to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, the film was made available on the Disney+ streaming service upon its debut on November 12, 2019. The Sound of Music film adaptation, like the stage musical, presents a history of the von Trapp family (a.k.a. the Trapp Family) that is not completely accurate. The musical was based on the West German film The Trapp Family (1956) rather than Maria von Trapp's 1949 memoirs, as director Vincent J. Donehue had seen the film and decided that it would make a good vehicle for Mary Martin. The musical followed the film's plot so closely that the New York Times review of the West German film noticed that it \"strongly suggests 'The Sound of Music,' often scene by scene.\" The West German screenwriters made several significant changes to the family's story that were kept in the musical. Maria had been hired to teach just one child, but the 1956 film made her governess to all seven children. The 1965 film adaptation was influenced by other musicals of its era, such as Mary Poppins, the Rodgers and Hammerstein television production of Cinderella, and the stage production of Lerner and Loewe's Camelot (coincidentally all starring Julie Andrews). Screenwriter Ernest Lehman was inspired by the opening of West Side Story and saw the musical as \"a fairy tale that's almost real\". The film incorporated many \"fairy tale\" tropes which included the idyllic imagery (placed in the hills of Salzburg), the European villas, and the cross-class Cinderella-like romance between Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As Maria walks down the aisle to be married, the pageantry is explicitly both Guinevere and Cinderella. In keeping with this tone the filmmakers used artistic license to convey the essence and meaning of their story. Georg Ludwig von Trapp was indeed an anti-Nazi opposed to the Anschluss, and lived with his family in a villa in a district of Salzburg called Aigen. Their lifestyle depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living. The actual family villa, located at Traunstra\u00dfe 34, Aigen 5026, was large and comfortable but not nearly as grand as the mansion depicted in the film. The house was also not their ancestral home, as depicted in the film. The family had previously lived in homes in Zell Am See and Klosterneuburg after being forced to abandon their actual ancestral home in Pola following World War I. Georg moved the family to the Salzburg villa shortly after the death of his first wife, Agathe Whitehead, in 1922. Georg is referred to as \"Captain\" in the film, but he held a noble title of \"Ritter\" (hereditary knight), which had higher social status than a naval officer. Although Austrian nobility was legally abolished in 1919 and the nobiliary particle von was proscribed, both continued to be widely used unofficially as a matter of social courtesy. Georg was offered a position in the German Kriegsmarine; Nazi Germany was looking to expand its fleet of U-boats, and Corvette Captain von Trapp was the most successful Austro-Hungarian submarine commander of World War I, having sunk 11 Allied merchant ships totaling 47,653 GRT and two Allied warships displacing a total of 12,641 tons. With his family in desperate financial straits, he seriously considered the offer before deciding he could not serve a Nazi regime. In the film, Georg is depicted initially as a humorless, emotionally distant father. In reality, third child Maria Franziska von Trapp (\n\nquestion: What was the inspiration for the cemetery scene in the movie?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1143}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She has a different recollection of her stepmother, Maria Augusta Kutschera, whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage. In a 2003 interview, Maria remembered, \" had a terrible temper... and from one moment to the next, you didn't know what hit her. We were not used to this. But we took it like a thunderstorm that would pass, because the next minute she could be very nice.\" Maria Kutschera had indeed been a novice at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and had been hired by the von Trapp family. However, she was hired only to be a tutor to young Maria Franziska, who had come down with scarlet fever and needed her lessons at home, not to be a governess for all of the children. Maria and Georg married for practical reasons, rather than love and affection for each other. Georg needed a mother for his children, and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey. \"I really and truly was not in love,\" Maria wrote in her memoir, \"I liked him but didn't love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children. I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after.\" They were married in 1927, not in 1938 as depicted in the film, and the couple had been married for over a decade by the time of the Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time. Maria and Georg enjoyed a happy marriage. The von Trapp family lost most of its wealth during the worldwide depression of the early 1930s, when the Austrian national bank folded. In order to survive, the family dismissed the servants and began taking in boarders. They also started singing onstage to earn money, a fact that caused the proud Georg much embarrassment. In the film, the von Trapp family hike over the Alps from Austria to Switzerland to escape the Nazis, which would not have been possible; Salzburg is over two hundred miles from Switzerland. The von Trapp villa, however, was only a few kilometers from the Austria\u2013Germany border, and the final scene shows the family hiking on the Obersalzberg near the German town of Berchtesgaden, within sight of Adolf Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus Eagle's Nest retreat. In reality, the family simply walked to the local train station and boarded a train to Italy. The Trapps were entitled to Italian citizenship since Georg had been born in Zadar, Dalmatia, Austria-Hungary, which had been annexed by Italy after World War I. They were able to emigrate to the United States via the United Kingdom on their Italian passports. The fictional character Max Detweiler, who acted as the scheming family music director in the film, is based on the von Trapps' family priest, the Reverend Franz Wasner, who was their musical director for over twenty years and, unlike Max, accompanied them when they left Austria. The character of Friedrich, the second oldest child in the film version, was based on Rupert, the oldest of the real von Trapp children. Liesl, the oldest child in the film, was based on Agathe von Trapp, the second oldest in the real family. The names and ages of the children were changed, in part because the third child, who would be portrayed as \"Louisa\", was also named Maria, and producers thought that it would be confusing to have two characters called Maria in the film. The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers. Robert Wise met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to Richard Zanuck, that he was not making a \"documentary or realistic movie\" about her family, and that he would make the film with \"complete dramatic freedom\" in order to produce a \"fine and moving film\", one they could all be proud of. Although The Sound of Music is set in Salzburg, it was largely ignored in Austria upon release. The film adaptation was a blockbuster worldwide, but it ran for only three days in Salzburg movie theaters, with locals showing \"disdain\" for a film that \"wasn't authentic.\" In 1966, American Express created the first Sound of Music guided tour in Salzburg. Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been the leading Sound of Music bus tour company in the city, taking approximately 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region. Although the Salzburg tourism industry took advantage of the attention from foreign tourists, residents of the city were apathetic\n\nquestion: What was the inspiration for the cemetery scene in the movie?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1127}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A German translation of the musical was performed on the national stage for the first time in 2005 at the Vienna Volksoper, receiving negative reviews from Austrian critics, who called it \"boring\" and referred to \"Edelweiss\" as \"an insult to Austrian musical creation.\" The musical finally premiered in Salzburg in 2011 at the Salzburger Landestheater, but Maria was played in the Salzburg premiere by a Dutch actress who \"grew up with the songs.\" However, most performances in Vienna and Salzburg were sold out, and the musical is now in both companies' repertoire. A Sing-along Sound of Music revival screening was first shown at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 1999, leading to a successful run at the Prince Charles Cinema which is ongoing as of 2018. During the screenings, audience members are often dressed as nuns and von Trapp children and are encouraged to sing along to lyrics superimposed on the screen. In July 2000, Sing-along Sound of Music shows opened in Boston, Massachusetts, and Austin, Texas. Some audience members dressed up as cast members and interacted with the action shown on the screen. The film began a successful run at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City in September 2000, with the opening attended by cast members Charmian Carr (Liesl), Daniel Truhitte (Rolfe), and Kym Karath (Gretl). Sing-along Sound of Music screenings have since become an international phenomenon. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The Academy Film Archive preserved The Sound of Music in 2003.

Directed by the multiple Academy Award winning luminary Robert Wise (who also directed \u2018West Side Story\u2019), the film boasted the talents of Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and was phenomenal commercial success, managing to rake in three hundred million dollars way back in the 1960s. Today, the legacy of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is irreproachable, having five Academy Awards to its name and enduring renown that continues to make the film relevant even today. Based on the 1959 stage musical of the same name (which in turn is based on the memoir \u201cThe Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u201d by Maria von Trapp), \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 follows the von Trapp family and their new governess Maria. Maria is a struggling nun who is assigned the job of taking care of the exceedingly mischievous seven von Trapp children. Their father, Georg von Trapp, is a retired naval captain who runs his household with military discipline after the death of his wife. While initially cold and hostile towards Maria, the von Trapp children eventually fall for her kind demeanor and melodious personality. Even the stoic captain finds himself falling for Maria affable charms but their idyllic lifestyle is threatened when the Nazis start to take over their country. If you were wondering what were \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 filming locations, read on. The backdrop for much of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is the charming pre World War II town of Salzburg in Austria during the 1930s. The scenery shows off distant snow-capped mountain peaks, verdant hilltops perfect for breaking into a spontaneous melody, and cultured medieval buildings that occupy the imagination. While it is possible to recreate these distinctive features of the region on a set as well, such a facsimile is unlikely to be nearly as authentic as the real thing. This is especially true of the 1960s when CGI wasn\u2019t really an option for filmmakers. Keeping this in mind, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 was largely filmed on location in Austria itself, specifically in the city of Salzburg. Limited filming for scenes was also done in studio in California, as well as a few scenes in Bavaria, Germany. Principal filming commenced in late March 1964 and concluded later that year in September.

The production started out with the filming of Maria\u2019s bedroom scenes as well as the nun Abbey cloister. Sketch artist Maurice Zuberano accompanied director Robert Wise to scout for locations in Austria. After a ten week period, Zuberano prepared a set of storyboards and location photos to art director Boris Leven, who designed and constructed the interior sets at Fox Studios in painstaking detail. It is on these sets that parts of the gazebo scenes in the wildly popular songs \u201cSomething Good\u201d and \u201cSixteen Going on Seventeen\u201d were filmed. The 20th century Fox Studios have served as the filming location for many world renowned films and TV shows including \u2018Modern Family\u2019, \u2018Fight Club\u2019, \u2018Edward Scissorhands\u2019, and \u2018Arrested Development\u2019. The majority of the filming for \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 took place in and around the delightful city of Salzburg in Austria. The wedding scenes were filmed at the Benedictine monastery of Mondsee Abbey in Upper Austria, with on location filming also done at Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and the Altstadt Old Town area of Salzburg.

Start Traveling. Austria \u2022 See & Do One of the most famous musical films, The Sound of Music, which was filmed in 1965 is still loved by many today. Each year hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Salzburg, Austria to walk in the footsteps of the legendary Von Trapp family. If you are a fan of the movie and wondering where the Sound of Music was filmed, you\u2019ve come to the right place. From the gazebo where Liesl sings \u201c16 going on 17\u201d to the Abbey where Maria lived and got married, here are all the must-visit Sound of Music filming locations. Recommendation: Relive the scenes of some of the most popular Sound of Music locations in Salzburg including Leopoldskron Palace, Nonnberg Abbey, and Mirabell Gardens on a guided Sound of Music tour. With an English speaking guide, and songs from the soundtrack playing throughout the tour, this Original Sound of Music tour from Salzburg won\u2019t disappoint! Marvel at the breathtaking locations for the Sound of Music and sing through the streets of Salzburg. Founded in 714 A.D., Nonnberg Abbey (German: Stift Nonnberg) is the oldest female convent north of the Alps and is where the real-life Maria became a novice nun and got married to Georg von Trapp. Nonnberg is where four scenes from the movie were filmed: the scene of the nuns singing \u201cMaria\u201d in the courtyard, Maria leaving the abbey, the kids visiting her at the abbey, and the Nazi\u2019s hunting the Von Trapps. Visitors will notice the interior of the Abbey is different from the movie, as filming inside the convent was not allowed, so the interior scenes were shot in a Hollywood studio. A highlight of this Sound of Music location in Salzburg is hearing the resident nuns Gregorian chants in Latin at 6:45 in the morning inside the beautiful Gothic abbey. The small yet beautiful flower filled St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery (German: Petersfriedhof) was the inspiration for the cemetery rebuilt on set for the scene towards the end of the movie in which the Von Trapps hide from the Nazis behind tombs. Beside being the resting place of Mozart\u2019s sister, Nannerl, this is also the resting place of Max Detweiler, \u201cUncle Max\u201d from the movie. This unique cemetery is one of the oldest (and most beautiful) cemeteries in the world and is Salzburg\u2019s oldest Christian cemetery. The catacombs carved out of the rocks of M\u00f6nchsberg provide a stunning view over the beautiful cemetery and should be visited during your Sound of Music tour in Salzburg. This baroque style garden, which was built in 1606 by the archbishop Wolf Dietrich for his mistress is a beautifully landscaped garden filled with gorgeous flowers, marble statues, fountains, and ample opportunities to reenact scenes from the movies. The iconic song, \u201cDo Re, Mi\u201d was partially shot here. While visiting Mirabell gardens, you\u2019ll relive the scene of Maria and the Von Trapp kids dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, jumping up and down the steps, as well as running through the hedge maze tunnel, all the while admiring the breathtaking view of Hohensalzburg Fortress in the distance. This film location spot, which can be visited for free, should not be missed. Situated in the center of Salzburg old town is Residence Square (German: Residenzplatz), which is home to the largest (45 feet tall) baroque fountain outside of Italy. It is in this square while singing \u201cI Have Confidence in Me\u201d, that Maria happily splashes water in the fountain, The Nazi soliders also march through the square later in the movie and hang their flag over the entrance of the old Residence Palace. Built in the 17th century to wash the horses of the prince-archbishop, the Horse Pond (German: Pferdeschwemme) was briefly featured in the movie as a backdrop to Maria and the kids singing \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d while dancing in their clothes made from curtains. In addition to being featured in the musical, the Horse Pond is well worth a visit in its own right. It is situation below the cliff side of M\u00f6nchsberg, and the bright fresco behind the horse pond makes for a gorgeous picture to add to your Sound of Music tour album. Carved into the M\u00f6nchsberg, the Rock Riding School (German: Felsenreitschule) was initially built to be a cathedral, but was later repurposed by the archbishop into a riding school where tournaments were held. Today it\u2019s Salzburg\u2019s most popular concert venue and is where the real Von Trapp family won the Sal\n\nquestion: Where was limited filming done for scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Nonnberg Abbey", "usage": 1064}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Fans will recognize this Sound of Music filming location from the scene where the Captain sings \u201cEdelweiss\u201d and his family joins him on stage to sing \u201cSo Long, Farewell\u201d. Frohnburg Palace played an important role in the Sound of Music as it was one of the two filming locations for the Von Trapp Villa. Once a private residence, the palace is now a Music Academy, the facade and large iron gate is where Maria first set her eyes on the Von Trapp family home towards the end of the song \u201cI Have Confidence\u201d. The Palace was also featured in the movie during the scenes in which the Captain rips the Nazi flag from above the doorway and during the family\u2019s attempt to escape from the Nazis by pushing their car silently out of the gate. Just outside the city center is Hellbrunn Palace, home to the Sound of Music gazebo. It was here that the most romantic scenes of the Sound of Music was captured; when Liesl gets her first kiss while singing \u201c16 going on 17.\u201d It is also where the Captain and Maria fall deeper in love with each other while singing \u201cSomething Good\u201d. Though visitors cannot go into the gazebo, they can dance, sing, and take as many pictures as they please around it. Make your visit to Hellbrunn even more exciting by taking a tour of the Trick Fountains at Hellbrunn Palace. The hour long tour takes you through grottoes, ponds, and walkways filled with trick fountains. Your ticket also lets you explore the inside of the palace. This is one of the best things to do in Salzburg and will be a memorable experience especially for the kids. Leopoldskron Palace is one of the most important filming location for the Sound of Music as the majestic palace and perfect lake view backdrop served as the primary filming location for all of the lake terrace scenes of the Von Trapp family home. This includes the scenes in which Maria and the kids fall off the boat into the lake, and when the Captain and Uncle Max are drinking pink lemonade on the terrace. Though the interior of the mansion was never filmed in the movie, the palace\u2019s gold Venetian ballroom and foyer were rebuilt in Hollywood for the interior scenes. Today the palace is a boutique hotel. Staying overnight is the only way to visit the film location up close and to get a peek into the Venetian ballroom. Staying here is the ultimate Sound of Music experience as you get to live in the home of the Von Trapp family in the film. You can book your stay at Leopoldskron Palace here. If you choose not to stay at the hotel, you can still view the Palace at a distance from the west side of the lake. Though not a filming location, the Von Trapp Villa is where the real Von Trapp family lived for 15 years. They managed to get onto a train at the nearby station to escape the Nazis one day before the Austrian borders were closed. Today the Von Trapp Villa operates as a hotel and an educational Sound of Music museum of the real Von Trapp family as well as behind the scenes information about the filming of the movie. Not far from Leopoldskron Palace, a visit to the Von Trapp Villa would give fans a true insight on the life of the legendary Von Trapp family that we have come to love. Fans can either book a stay at the Villa or simply visit on a guided tour which takes place every day and lasts about 45 minutes. Mt. Untersberg is depicted twice in the Sound of Music, once during the opening scene in which Maria is singing the \u201cSound of Music\u201d and again when the family is escaping over the mountain to Switzerland while singing \u201cClimb Every Mountain\u201d. Fans can easily access Mount Untersberg from Salzburg via bus and get to the top via cable car. More adventurous travelers can hike 2 hours to the top. At 1,853 meters above the Salzburg basin, Mt. Untersberg offers breaktaking views over the region and is worth the day trip from Salzburg. Less than an hour bus drive from Salzburg is the picturesque lakeside town Mondsee. There you can visit the beautiful Collegiate Church of St. Michael where Maria and Georg von Trapp got married in the movie. This is a must-see for any Sound of Music fan. Make a full-day trip out of the location and stroll through the town, take a refreshing dip in the lake, hike up the nearby forest, and eat delicious seafood along the lake. In the opening scene of the movie you get a gorgeous aerial view of the village of St. Gilgen and the popular lake, Wolfgangsee. The village and lake can easily be reached by train.

The short 1.4km hike from the Werfen town takes about half an hour to complete. Once at the top you can enjoy a picnic and breathtaking views of the surrounding areas and the Hohenwerfen Fortress. Make your trip to Werfen a full day adventure by visiting both the Hohenwerfen Fortress and the largest ice cave in the world, Eisriesenwelt. Both sights will be a welcome addition to your Salzburg itinerary. Situated just across the German border, atop the magnificent Rossfeld mountain, is the Rossfeld Panoramic Road which was used in the movie to show the safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain. The private road, Rossfeld Panoramic Road is the only filming location that\u2019s difficult to get to without a car. If you don\u2019t have a car, it is recommended to visit the nearby Untersberg Mountain to get just as spectacular views with easier accessibility. Well there you have it, the top must-visit Sound of Music filming location in and around Salzburg. All locations can be visited on your own, but if you don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle or you have limited time, consider taking a guided Sound of Music tour from Salzburg or Vienna. And to make your Sound of Music trip even more memorable, spend a night or two at the home of the Von Trapp family in the film; Hotel Schloss Leopoldskron, or in the home of the real Von Trapp family at Villa Trapp. Either one will take your trip from amazing to extraordinary. Waseem says 1 month ago The Sound of Music gazebo at Hellbrunn Palace in Salzburg was moved here from its original location at Schloss Leopoldskron. Allan Trivette says 5 months ago The writer/compiler of this page shows an obvious love for the film. I was put under a \u201cSound of Music\u201d spell at the age of 10 when the film first came out, and I\u2019m still spellbound to this day. I\u2019ve visited Salzburg 5 times, and I can\u2019t wait to go back again. But, there are a few errors on this page that need to be clarified and/or corrected. First \u2013 #7 Frohnburg Palace \u2013 the writer of this article is correct \u2013 it WAS used as the von Trapp home in the film. However, what we see in the film as the FRONT of the von Trapp home is actually the BACK of Frohnburg! The FRONT of Frohnburg was used as the BACK of the von Trapp home in the film! The back of the home is seen when Rolf comes to deliver a telegram and the Captain takes it abruptly and tells him to leave. You see it also when the pink lemonade is served. Now, to make this even more complicated, the back of the film home looking toward the lake: the canoe flipping, the Baroness and the Captain strolling by the lake, Leisl running out to meet Rolf, Maria\u2019s return when she comes back from the Abbey, etc., is located to the left of Schloss Leopoldskron. I\u2019ll write more about this below. #8 \u2013 Hellbrun Palace (the gazebo) \u2013 correction \u2013 NONE of the gazebo scenes (\u201c16 Going on 17\u201d and \u201cSomething Good\u201d) were shot anywhere near the gazebo. It was a set in Hollywood. The only time we see the gazebo that is at Hellbrun is when the Captain and the Baroness take their stroll by the lake (just before the canoe flipping). It can be seen briefly in the background during their stroll. #9 \u2013 Leopoldskron Palace \u2013 was NOT used at ALL at any time during the filming!! The production company DID want to film the lake scenes there, but the officials of the Palace at that time wanted too much money. They did, however, offer the company the use of the \u201cside lawn\u201d. If you look at the photo of the Palace on this page, the side lawn is not seen, but it is to the left of the photo\u2019s edge. The \u201cOfficial Sound of Music Tour\u201d guides will show you the Schloss and point out the original horse-headed statues and lake gate and tell you that is where those scenes were filmed. WRONG!!! The \u201clake-gate\u201d and the horse-headed fish statues, were recreated by 20th Century-Fox and erected on the \u201cside lawn\u201d where the Meierhof is now located. The Meierhof used to be the administrative offices for the Palace, but it\n\nquestion: Where was limited filming done for scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "California", "usage": 1050}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If one enters the main gate for the Schloss, the Schloss is to the left and the Meierhof is to the right. Walking straight from the gate to the lake one will see the pedestals for the horse-headed statues are still there. As was stated by the writer, the Venetian Room is in the Schloss and was used as the inspiration for the ballroom in the film. #11 \u2013 Mount Untersberg \u2013 clarification \u2013 the mount is seen several times in the background of several scenes, but NO SCENES were filmed ON it. #15 \u2013 Rossfeld Mountain \u2013 clarification \u2013 again, \u201cthe safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain\u201d is inaccurate. That \u201cescape\u201d scene was filmed just off the Rossfeld Panoramastrasse. There is a roadside cafe/restaurant on the Panoramastrasse called the Ahornkaser (they serve the best Apple Strudel you\u2019ll ever have). Standing in front of the Ahornkaser, there is a path on the right side of the building. Take that path about 400 feet and look up to your right. At the top of the hill is the exact spot where the von Trapps cross the mountain to freedom as \u201cClimb Ev\u2019ry Mountain\u201d is sung. At the end of that scene, with that open vista lying before them, you can see the Untersberg in the distance. I hope this helps/informs anyone planning on making a visit. Negar Modgeddi says 1 month ago I LOVE your notations about the actual places and your very thoughtful corrections! Melanie says 6 months ago Thank you for this great information! Do you know which field Maria was walking in during the opening scene? I know it was Untersberg Mountain in the background, but I can\u2019t find any information on the field she was frolicking through to get that sweeping view. Any pointers you can offer would be most appreciated! Ben says 6 months ago The opening scene was filmed on Mehlweg meadow which is not open to the public.

The opening aerial shots are Salzburg\u2019s glorious Lake District, the Salzkammergut. The castles you can see are Kloster H\u00f6glw\u00f6rth, an old monastery on a peninsula in H\u00f6glw\u00f6rther See; and Schloss Anif, off E55 a few miles south of Salzburg. The mountain, atop which Maria (Julie Andrews) makes her first twirling appearance, is Mehlweg, near the Bavarian village of Markt Schellenberg, about six miles from Salzburg. Don\u2019t be too disappointed \u2013 the birch trees and the babbling brook were added for the movie. Convent interiors were recreated in the studio, but the exterior really is Maria\u2019s abbey. It\u2019s Nonnberg Abbey, Nonnberg Gasse, where you can visit the courtyard and peek inside the chapel (which looks nothing like the interior recreated back in Hollywood). The film cheats a little with the exterior, too. As you\u2019ll find if you visit, the real Nonnberg Abbey doesn\u2019t look out over the picturesque old town of Salzburg, but to the nondescript southern suburbs. The reverse shot, of Maria leaving the abbey, filmed way across the city on the Humboldt Terrace (seen later in the Do Re Mi number), in front of the Museum of Modern Art, which since 2002 has stood atop M\u00f6nchsberg Cliffs on the site of the old Cafe Winkler. As Maria leaves to take up her post with the Von Trapp family, I Have Confidence in Me was filmed in Salzburg\u2019s Old Town, in the Residenzplatz, where you\u2019ll see the Domplatz arches, through which Maria enters, and the Residenz Fountain, in which she splashes. The \u2018Villa Von Trapp\u2019 is a combination of two different Salzburg locations. The tree-shaded lane, where Maria alights from the bus, is Hellbrunner Allee, running south from the old town. Here you\u2019ll recognise Schloss Frohnburg, a 17th century country house, now the Mozarteum Music Academy, which was used for the intimidating gates and front entrance of the villa which Maria nervously approaches. The lakeside terrace, though, was filmed at Schloss Leopoldskron, a rococo castle on Leopoldskroner Teich, a small artificial lake on the southwest of the town. You can view Leopoldskron across the lake from K\u00f6nig Ludwig Strasse, but it's now \u2013 hurrah! \u2013 a hotel. Leopoldskron's extravagantly gilt Venetian Room was replicated in the studio in Hollywood. Incidentally, the famous gazebo originally stood on the palace's grounds, when it was a private villa, but was moved to a more accessible location. The real Villa Trapp, by the way, is in Aigen, a suburb just to the southeast of the Old Town of Salzburg. Since 2008, it\u2019s been open as a hotel, Villa Trapp, Traunstra\u00dfe 34, 5026 Salzburg. There\u2019s a rail service to Bahnhof Aigen. The little footbridge over which the von Trapps skip at the beginning of the My Favourite Things montage of Salzburg is Mozart Steg, north of Mozart Platz. They quickly move on to Domplatz, in front of Salzburger Dom (Salzburg Cathedral); Kapitelschwemme, the Baroque horse pond once used for watering and cleaning horses, in Herbert von Karajan Platz; and the market on Kajetanerplatz, just north of Nonnberg Abbey, where Maria demonstrates her tomato juggling skills. They finally head off for a picnic in the meadow above the village of Werfen, 25 miles south of Salzburg in the Salzach River valley (where you can also visit the castle from wartime action movie Where Eagles Dare). Do-Re-Mi begins at the picnic, returning to Salzburg atop the Monchsberg Cliffs, on Humboldt Terrace which you can reach from the Monchsberg elevator in Anton Neumayrplatz, at the end of the Gstattengasse shopping street, and continuing with a carriage ride south from St Erhard Kirche, the Parish Church of St Erhard, along Nonntaler Hauptstra\u00dfe,\n\nquestion: Where was limited filming done for scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "20th Century-Fox studios in Hollywood", "usage": 1042}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The number climaxes at Mirabell Gardens, on Schwarzstrasse, over the Salzach River behind Schloss Mirabell, where you\u2019ll find the fountains, statues and, famously, the flight of steps on which the children hop. The Von Trapp gazebo, used for Sixteen Going On Seventeen, once stood in the grounds of Leopoldskron, but constant trespassing resulted in it being moved and reconstructed in the ornamental gardens of Schloss Hellbrunn, Morzger Strasse, toward the south of Salzburg. And another cheat. It was recreated, slightly larger, back at 20th Century-Fox in Hollywood for the interior shots. Maria\u2019s wedding, which took place in Nonnberg Abbey, was filmed in the baroque, twin-towered St Michael\u2019s Church, Wredeplatz, in Mondsee, about 15 miles east of Salzburg on the E55/E60. The Anschluss scene, Austria\u2019s enforced unity with Nazi Germany, was staged back in the centre of Salzburg itself in Residenzplatz. The music festival, at which the von Trapp family perform their disappearing act, is at the Felsenreitschule (\u2018Rock Riding School\u2019), Hofstallgasse 1, a 1400-seat theatre built in what was a rock quarry for Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun in 1693, and used as the archbishop's riding school. It\u2019s one of the sites of the Salzburg Festival. Despite what some overenthusiastic tour guides might tell you, the cemetery in which the von Trapps hide from the Nazis is a Hollywood studio set, though its design is clearly based on St Peter\u2019s Graveyard, which you can see just off Kapitelplatz. The mountain over which the family finally escapes to freedom is above the village of Obersalzburg with views of the Untersberg in the distance, near the village of Rossfeld, on the 319, 12 miles south of Salzburg. \u2022 Many thanks to Lieselotte Mayrhofer; and to Bryan Crawford of Edelweiss Tours for help with this section.

Adapted from the 1959 stage musical of the same name, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is actually based on the memoir, titled \u2018The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u2019. The story deals with a postulant, who goes to the imposing home of a retired naval officer. The man is a widower, and the young woman acts as a governess to his children. Soon enough, she brings music and love to the entire family, and it is not long before she falls in love with her employer as well. Together they band, as they have to face the loss of their motherland to the Nazis. If you have seen the movie, you already know that it takes place in Salzburg in Austria. Over the course of the film, there are several iconic scenes that have been shot at picturesque locations, or there are some locations that have been simply elevated due to the value of the scene itself (think of the gazebo where \u2018Sixteen Going on Seventeen\u2019 is performed). Naturally, you might be wondering about the exact filming locations of this popular movie, and we have got you covered in that regard. When \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 started filming, the crew did not head immediately to the real locations for the movie. Instead, when principal photography began on March 26, 1964, it started at the 20th Century Fox studios located in Los Angeles. Following this, the crew headed to Salzburg, where they filmed at a variety of locations including the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and Residence Fountain, among others. Filming commenced here from April 23, to around May 22. Various other locations nearby were used, and shooting went on till around June 19. The crew also hit up places nearby including Werfen in the Salzach River valley. Some scenes were also shot in Bavaria, with the Alps serving as a wonderful backdrop. Around July 6, the team headed back to Los Angeles for the remaining scenes, and principal photography ultimately wrapped up by September 1, 1964. As is evident, a plethora of locations have been hit in this frenzied shooting schedule, and we now proceed to the specific filming locations, rendered memorable by the iconic scenes that have unfolded there. Salzburg in Austria serves as the place where most of the pivotal scenes of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place. Some of the most recognizable locations include Mirabell Palace and Gardens. If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you must know that \u2018Do re mi\u2019 is one of the most popular songs. The ending of this song sees Maria and the von Trapp kids at the Mirabell Palace and Gardens. Located in Salzburg\u2019s old town, we can see the movie characters dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, which is located in front of the palace. The other recognizable locations happen to be the rose garden at the north of the fountain and the Greek fencing statues at the entrance. Residenzplatz Square and Fountain also plays an important part, early on, as Maria can be seen splashing in the baroque horse fountain here, while \u2018I Have Confidence in Me\u2019 is playing. When Germany annexes Austria, we see Nazi soldiers marching through this square, while a Swastika flag is raised above the Old Residence Palace\u2019s entrance. The Summer Riding School (Felsenreitschule) is where the von Trapp family takes the stage, performing \u2018Edelweiss\u2019 and \u2018So long, Farewell\u2019, for the Folk Festival. Notably, hundreds of extras were hired for the scene to sing along. A little away from this location, on Herbert von Karajan Square, is the Horse Pond, where Maria and the children dance at the end of \u2018My Favorite Things\u2019. Leopoldskron Palace is important in its own way since all the lake terrace scenes of the von Trapp family home were shot here. Schloss Frohnburg was also used to show the von Trapp house, rather the intimidating front gates which Maria nervously approaches initially. Nonnberg Abbey Convent is where Maria lived, and the exteriors of the same have been used in the movie. However, the movie has taken some liberties here, as the convent does not actually look over the old town of Salzburg, but instead has a view of the nondescript southern suburbs. St. Michael Basilica in Mondsee, outside Salzburg, is remarkable because Maria gets married to Georg von Trapp, in one of the most famous scenes from the movie. Werfen, which is around a 40-minute drive away from Salzburg, has the Gschwandtanger Meadow, which\n\nquestion: Where was limited filming done for scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Los Angeles", "usage": 1079}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Bavaria is important for being one of the first scenes where Maria makes her entrance. She can be seen twirling at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg. The sequence where the von Trapps escape the Nazis is also shot on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. Notably, Stage 8 and Stage 15 were used in the studios, but a lot of important scenes were shot there. Firstly, shooting inside the convent was not allowed, meaning that the set was created in the studio itself. The golden foyer and the ballroom, we see in the house, were also recreated in Hollywood. There is an important scene where the Von Trapp family hides from the Nazis behind some tombs. While the scenes have been recreated in Hollywood, they closely resemble St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery and Catacombs in Salzburg. The gazebo where two of the finest songs in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place, that is, \u2018Something Good\u2019 and \u201916 going on 17\u2032, is actually both a real-life location as well as something created in a studio. The real-life gazebo is near the Eastern entrance to the Hellbrunn Palace. A larger one was rebuilt in Hollywood where most of the scenes were actually shot. As is evident, the scenes in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 have been carefully shot to capture the beauty of the location and to transport us into this enchanting world inhabited by the von Trapp family and Maria. Making the best use of the locations is just one small aspect that has helped this film go down in history as one of the most memorable examples of great cinema.

The film is an adaptation of the 1959 stage musical, composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and a book by Lindsay and Crouse. Based on the 1949 memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria von Trapp, the film is set in Salzburg, Austria and is a fictional retelling of her experiences as governess to seven children, her eventual marriage with their father Captain Georg Von Trapp, and their escape during the Anschluss in 1938. Filming took place from March to September 1964 in Los Angeles and Salzburg. The Sound of Music was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited roadshow theatrical release. Although initial critical response to the film was mixed, it was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office film after four weeks, and the highest-grossing film of 1965. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all-time\u2014surpassing Gone with the Wind\u2014and held that distinction for five years. The film was just as popular throughout the world, breaking previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries. Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years, and two successful re-releases, the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286 million. The Sound of Music received five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Wise's second pair of both awards, the first being from the 1961 film West Side Story. The film also received two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture and Best Actress, the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. In 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) listed The Sound of Music as the fifty-fifth greatest American film of all time, and the fourth-greatest film musical. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg in 1938. Her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern. Mother Abbess sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children\u2014Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children out of drapes that are to be changed. She takes them around Salzburg and the mountains while teaching them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake which concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain attempts to fire Maria. However, he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. The Captain apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay. Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes that he enters them in the upcoming Salzburg Festival, but the Captain disapproves of letting his children sing in public. During a grand party at the villa, where guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional L\u00e4ndler folk dance, he steps in and partners Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy by indirectly convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. However, Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, so she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her purpose in life. When Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. However, the Baroness learns that the Captain's feelings\n\nquestion: Where was limited filming done for scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Los Angeles and Salzburg", "usage": 1122}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

While the couple is on their honeymoon, Max enters the children into the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. Having learned that Austria has been annexed by the Third Reich, the couple return to their home, where the Captain receives a telegram, ordering him to report to the German Naval base at Bremerhaven to accept a commission in the Kriegsmarine. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and their ideology, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. That night, the von Trapp family attempt to flee to Switzerland, but they are stopped by a group of Brownshirts, led by the Gauleiter Hans Zeller, waiting outside the villa. To cover his family's tracks, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven. Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slips away and seeks shelter at the abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Zeller and his men soon arrive and search the abbey, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When they attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start, as two of the nuns have sabotaged their engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom. The real Maria von Trapp has a brief uncredited cameo as a passerby, alongside her children Rosmarie and Werner von Trapp during \"I Have Confidence\". The Sound of Music story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, published in 1949 to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband Georg in 1947. Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told. In 1956, German producer Wolfgang Liebeneiner purchased the film rights for $9,000 (equivalent to $97,000 in 2022), hired George Hurdalek and Herbert Reinecker to write the screenplay, and Franz Grothe to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional Austrian folk songs. The Trapp Family was released in West Germany on October 9, 1956, and became a major success. Two years later, Liebeneiner directed a sequel, The Trapp Family in America, and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years. Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America. In 1956, Paramount Pictures purchased the United States film rights, intending to produce an English-language version with Audrey Hepburn as Maria. The studio eventually dropped its option, but one of its directors, Vincent J. Donehue, proposed the story as a stage musical for Mary Martin. Producers Richard Halliday and Leland Heyward secured the rights and hired playwrights Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, who had won the Pulitzer Prize for State of the Union. They approached Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II to compose one song for the musical, but the composers felt the two styles\u2014traditional Austrian folk songs and their composition\u2014would not work together. They offered to write a completely new score for the entire production if the producers were willing to wait while they completed work on Flower Drum Song. The producers quickly responded that they would wait as long as necessary. The Sound of Music stage musical opened on November 16, 1959, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York City and ran on Broadway for 1,443 performances, winning six Tony Awards, including Best Musical. In June 1960, Twentieth Century-Fox purchased the film adaptation rights to the stage musical for $1.25 million (equivalent to $12,400,000 in 2022) against ten percent of the gross. In December 1962, 20th Century-Fox president Richard D. Zanuck hired Ernest Lehman to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of the stage musical. Lehman reviewed the original script for the stage musical, rearranged the sequence of songs, and began transforming a work designed for the stage into a film that could use the camera to emphasize action and mood and open the story up to the beautiful locations of Salzburg and the Austrian Alps. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" sequence in the play, for example, was originally a stagnant number; Lehman transformed it into a lively montage showing some of the beautiful sites of Salzburg, as well as showing Maria and the children growing closer over time. Lehman also eliminated two songs, \"How Can Love Survive?\" and \"No Way to Stop It\", sung by the characters of Elsa and Max. In January 1963, he saw the Fox English-d\n\nquestion: Where was limited filming done for scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1127}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material. While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director. Their first choice was Robert Wise, with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of West Side Story, but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, The Sand Pebbles. Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including Stanley Donen, Vincent J. Donehue, George Roy Hill, and Gene Kelly. In January 1963, Lehman invited one of his favorite directors, William Wyler, to travel to New York City with him to see the Broadway musical. After seeing the show, Wyler said he hated it, but after two weeks of Lehman's persuasion, Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film. After hiring musical supervisor Roger Edens, Wyler, Lehman, and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations. In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy-five locations\u2014an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences. During that trip, Lehman began to have reservations about Wyler's commitment to the project and communicated this to Zanuck, who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible. Lehman completed the first draft on September 10, 1963, and sent it to Wyler, who had no suggestions or changes to add. At that time, Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise, whom Lehman still wanted as the director. Later that month, Wyler's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct The Collector. Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film, and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director, ending Wyler's participation. Meanwhile, Wise, whose film The Sand Pebbles had been postponed, read Lehman's first draft, was impressed by what he read, and agreed to direct the film, joining the picture in October 1963, and flew to Salzburg with associate producer Saul Chaplin and members of his production team to scout filming locations, including many that Wyler had identified. When he returned, Wise began working on the script. Wise shared Lehman's vision of the film being centered on the music, and the changes he made were consistent with the writer's approach\u2014mainly reducing the amount of sweetness and sentimentality found in the stage musical. He had reservations about Lehman's opening aerial sequence because West Side Story, whose screenplay Lehman had also written, had used a similar opening sequence, but he was unable to think of a better one and decided to keep Lehman's. Other changes included replacing \"An Ordinary Couple\" with a more romantic number, and a new song for Maria's departure from the abbey\u2014Rodgers provided \"Something Good\" and \"I Have Confidence\", especially for the film. Lehman completed the second draft on December 20, 1963, but additional changes would be made based on input from Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer about the character of the Captain. Plummer especially helped change a character lacking substance into a stronger, more forceful complex figure with a wry sense of humor and a darker edge. Lehman completed his final draft on March 20, 1964. Lehman's first and only choice for Maria was Julie Andrews. When Wise joined the project, he made a list of his choices for the role, which included Andrews as his first choice, Grace Kelly, and Shirley Jones. Wise and Lehman went to Disney Studios to view footage from Mary Poppins, which was not yet released. A few minutes into the film, Wise told Lehman, \"Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this film and grabs her!\" Andrews had some reservations\u2014mainly about the amount of sweetness in the theatrical version\u2014but when she learned that her concerns were shared by Wise and Lehman and what their vision was, she signed a contract with Fox to star in The Sound of Music and one other film for $225,000 (equivalent to $2,120,000 in 2022). Wise had a more difficult time casting the role of the Captain. A number of actors were considered for the part, including Bing Crosby, Yul Brynner, Sean Connery, and Richard Burton. Wise had seen Christopher Plummer on Broadway and wanted him for the role, but the stage actor turned down the offer several times. Wise flew to London to meet with Plummer and explained his concept of the film; the actor accepted after being assured that he could work with Lehman to improve the character. Wise also spent considerable time and effort on casting the secondary characters. For the role of Max Detweiler, Wise initially considered Victor Borge, No\u00ebl Coward, and Hal Holbrook among others before deciding on Richard Haydn. For the character of Baroness Elsa Schraeder\n\nquestion: Where was limited filming done for scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Austria", "usage": 1121}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The casting of the children's characters began in November 1963 and involved over two hundred interviews and auditions throughout the United States and England. Some of the child actors interviewed or tested, who were not selected, included Mia Farrow, Patty Duke, Lesley Ann Warren, Geraldine Chaplin, Shelley Fabares, Teri Garr, Kurt Russell, and The Osmonds. Most of the actors selected had some acting, singing, or dancing experience. Charmian Carr, however, was a model who worked part-time in a doctor's office and had no ambition to pursue a career as an actress. After a friend sent her photo to Wise's office, she was asked to interview. Wise later recalled, \"She was so pretty and had such poise and charm that we liked her immediately.\" The last person to be cast was Daniel Truhitte in the role of Rolfe. Rehearsals for the singing and dance sequences began on February 10, 1964. The husband-and-wife team of Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, who had worked with Andrews on Mary Poppins, worked out the choreography with Saul Chaplin on piano\u2014the arrangements could not be altered under Rodgers and Hammerstein's contract. The stage choreography was not used because it was too restrictive. Breaux and Wood worked out all-new choreography better suited for the film that incorporated many of the Salzburg locations and settings. They even choreographed the newly added puppet dance sequence for \"The Lonely Goatherd\". The choreography for the L\u00e4ndler strictly followed the traditional Austrian folk dance. The musical arranger Irwin Kostal prerecorded the songs with a large orchestra and singers on a stage before the start of filming. In her book, The Sound of Music: The Making of America's Favorite Movie, Julia Antopol Hirsch says that Kostal used seven children and five adults to record the children's voices; the only scene in which the child-actors' singing is heard in the released version of the film is when they sing \"The Sound of Music\" on their own after Maria leaves. Charmian Carr refuted the claim that the voices of the child actors were dubbed in the film and on the soundtrack. Carr contended that all of the children who are in the film sing on the track, but four other children were added to most of the songs to give them a fuller sound; they did not replace them as singers. The voices of some of the adult actors had voice doubles, including those of Peggy Wood and Christopher Plummer. Principal photography began on March 26, 1964, at 20th Century-Fox studios in Los Angeles, where scenes from Maria's bedroom and the abbey cloister and graveyard were filmed. The company then flew to Salzburg, where filming resumed on April 23 at Mondsee Abbey for the wedding scenes. From April 25 through May 22, scenes were filmed at the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, Residence Fountain, and various street locations throughout the Altstadt (Old Town) area of the city. Wise faced opposition from city leaders who did not want him staging scenes with swastika banners. They relented after he threatened instead to include old newsreel footage featuring the banners. On days when it rained, a constant challenge for the company, Wise arranged for scenes to be shot at St. Margarethen Chapel and D\u00fcrer Studios (Reverend Mother's office). From May 23 to June 7, the company worked at Schloss Leopoldskron and an adjacent property called Bertelsmann for scenes representing the lakeside terrace and gardens of the von Trapp villa. From June 9 to 19, scenes were shot at Frohnburg Palace, which represented the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa. Karath could not swim and was in danger during the capsizing boat scene. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" picnic scene in the mountains was filmed above the town of Werfen in the Salzach River valley on June 25 and 27. The opening sequence of Maria on her mountain was filmed from June 28 to July 2 at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg in Bavaria. During filming, Birch trees were added and then removed. The brook she walks through was plastic filled with water which was put there during filming. The final scene of the von Trapp family escaping over the mountains was filmed on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. The cast and crew flew back to Los Angeles and resumed filming at Fox Studios on July 6 for all remaining scenes, including those in the villa dining room, ballroom, terrace, living room, and gazebo. Following the last two scenes shot in the gazebo\u2014for the songs \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Sevent\n\nquestion: Where was limited filming done for scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "California", "usage": 1116}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A total of eighty-three scenes were filmed in just over five months. Post-production work began on August 25 with three weeks of dialogue dubbing to correct lines that were ruined by various street noises and rain. In October, Christopher Plummer's singing voice was dubbed by veteran Disney playback singer Bill Lee. The film was then edited by Wise and film editor William Reynolds. Once the film was edited, Irwin Kostal, who orchestrated the musical numbers, underscored the film with background music consisting of variations on Rodgers and Hammerstein's original songs to amplify or add nuances to the visual images. When dubbing, editing, and scoring were complete, Wise arranged for two sneak-preview showings\u2014the first one held in Minneapolis on Friday, January 15, 1965 at the Mann Theater, and the second one held the following night in Tulsa. Despite the \"sensational\" responses from the preview audiences, Wise made a few final editing changes before completing the film. According to the original print information for the film, the running time for the theatrical release version was 174 minutes. The film was still in release when the Motion Picture Association of America's film ratings system was implemented in 1968, and was subsequently given a \"G\" rating (\"general audiences\") in 1969. The Sound of Music was filmed in Todd-AO by Ted McCord and produced with DeLuxe Color processing. Aerial footage was photographed with an MCS-70 camera. The sound was recorded on a 70 mm six-track using a Westrex recording system. The sets used for the film were based on the storyboards of sketch artist Maurice Zuberano, who accompanied Wise to Austria to scout filming locations in November 1963. Wise met with the artist over ten weeks and explained his objective for each scene\u2014the feeling he wanted to convey and the visual images he wanted to use. When Zuberano was finished, he provided Wise with a complete set of storyboards that illustrated each scene and set\u2014storyboards the director used as guidance during filming. Zuberano's storyboards and location photos were also used by art director Boris Leven to design and construct all of the original interior sets at Fox studios, as well as some external sets in Salzburg. The von Trapp villa, for example, was actually filmed in several locations: the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa were filmed at Frohnburg Palace, the lakeside terrace and gardens was a set constructed on a property adjacent to Schloss Leopoldskron called Bertelsmann, and the interior was a constructed set at Fox Studios. The gazebo scenes for \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" were filmed on a larger reconstructed set at Fox studios, while some shots of the original gazebo were filmed on the grounds at Schloss Leopoldskron in Salzburg. Most of the soundtrack to The Sound of Music was written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and arranged and conducted by Irwin Kostal, who also adapted the instrumental underscore passages. Both the lyrics and music for two new songs were written by Rodgers, as Hammerstein died in 1960. The soundtrack album was released by RCA Victor in 1965 and is one of the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 20 million copies worldwide. The album reached the number one position on the Billboard 200 that year in the United States. It remained in the top ten for 109 weeks, from May 1, 1965, to July 16, 1967, and remained on the Billboard 200 chart for 238 weeks. The album was the best-selling album in the United Kingdom in 1965, 1966, and 1968 and the second best-selling of the entire decade, spending a total of 70 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It also stayed 73 weeks on the Norwegian charts, becoming the seventh best-charting album of all time in that country. In 2015, Billboard named the album the second greatest album of all time. The album has been reissued several times, including anniversary editions with additional tracks in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Wise hired Mike Kaplan to direct the publicity campaign for the film. After reading the script, Kaplan decided on the ad line \"The Happiest Sound in All the World\", which would appear on promotional material and artwork. Kaplan also brought in outside agencies to work with the studio's advertising department to develop the promotional artwork, eventually selecting a painting by Howard Terpning of Andrews on an alpine meadow with her carpetbag and guitar case in hand with the children and Plummer in the background. In February 1964, Kaplan began placing ads in the trade papers Daily Variety, Weekly Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter to attract future exhibitor interest in the project. The studio intended the film to have an initial roadshow theatrical release in select large cities in theaters that could accommodate the 70-mm screenings and six-track stereophonic sound.

Kaplan identified forty key cities that would likely be included in the roadshow release and developed a promotional strategy targeting the major newspapers of those cities. During the Salzburg production phase, 20th Century-Fox organized press junkets for American journalists to interview Wise and his team and the cast members. \"No one is comfortable with an excess of hearts and flowers, but there is no valid reason for hiding honest emotion. This has always been a major element in the theatre, and it's my conviction that anyone who can't, on occasion, be sentimental about children, home or nature is sadly maladjusted.\" Richard Rodgers The film had its opening premiere on March 2, 1965, at the Rivoli Theater in New York City. Initial reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's \"romantic nonsense and sentiment\", the children's \"artificial roles\", and Robert Wise's \"cosy-cum-corny\" direction. Judith Crist, in a biting review in the New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as \"icky sticky\" and designed for \"the five to seven set and their mommies\". In her review for McCall's magazine, Pauline Kael called the film \"the sugar-coated lie people seem to want to eat\", and that audiences have \"turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs.\" Wise later recalled, \"The East Coast, intellectual papers and magazines destroyed us, but the local papers and the trades gave us great reviews\". Indeed, reviewers such as Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \"three hours of visual and vocal brilliance\", and Variety called it \"a warmly-pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast\". The \"wildly mixed film reviews\" reflected the critical response to the stage musical, according to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical. After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10, The Sound of Music opened in 131 theaters in the United States, including a limited number of roadshow events. After four weeks, the film became the number one box office movie in the country and held that position for thirty out of the next forty-three weeks in 1965. The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years. A few months after its United States release, The Sound of Music opened in 261 theaters in other countries, the first American movie to be completely dubbed in a foreign language, both dialogue, and music. The German, French, Italian, and Spanish versions were completely dubbed, the Japanese version had Japanese dialogue with English songs, and other versions were released with foreign subtitles. The film was a popular success in every country it opened, except the two countries where the story originated, Austria and Germany. In these two countries, the film had to compete with the much-loved Die Trapp-Familie (1956), which provided the original inspiration for the Broadway musical, and its sequel Die Trapp-Familie in Amerika (1958); both films are still widely popular in German-speaking Europe and considered the authoritative von Trapp story. Austrians took exception to the liberties taken by the filmmakers with regard to the costumes, which did not reflect the traditional style and the replacement of traditional Austrian folk songs with Broadway show tunes. The film's Nazi theme was especially unpopular in Germany, where the Munich branch manager for 20th Century-Fox approved the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act of the film following the wedding sequence\u2014the scenes showing Salzburg following the Anschluss. Robert Wise and the studio intervened, the original film was restored, and the branch manager was fired. The Sound of Music holds an 84% \"Certified Fresh\" score on Rotten Tomatoes based on seventy-four reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's consensus states: \"Unapologetically sweet and maybe even a little corny, The Sound of Music will win over all but the most cynical filmgoers with its classic songs and irresistible warmth.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on eleven critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The Sound of Music is one of the most commercially successful films of all time. Four weeks after its theatrical release, it became the number one box office movie in the United States, from revenue generated by twenty-five theaters, each screening only ten roadshow performances per week. It held the number one position for thirty of the next forty-three weeks, and ended up the highest-grossing film of 1965. One contributing factor in the film's early commercial success was the repeat business of many filmgoers. In some cities in the United States, the number of tickets sold exceeded the total population.

Worldwide, The Sound of Music broke previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries, including the United Kingdom, where it played for a record-breaking three years at the Dominion Theatre in London and earned \u00a34 million in rentals and grossed \u00a36 million\u2014more than twice as much as any other film had taken in. It was also a major success in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, where it played for as long as two years at some theaters. It was not a universal success, however, with the film only enjoying modest success in France and it was a flop in Germany. It also initially performed poorly in Italy, but a re-release after the Oscars brought better results. It was number one at the US box office for a further 11 weeks in 1966, for a total of 41 weeks at number one. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all time, with over $67.5 million in worldwide rentals ($125 million in gross receipts), surpassing Gone with the Wind, which held that distinction for twenty-four years. It was still in the top ten at the US box office in its 100th week of release. The Sound of Music completed its initial four-and-a-half year theatrical release run in the United States on Labor Day 1969, the longest initial run for a film in the US, having earned $68,313,000 in rentals in the United States and Canada. It played for 142 weeks at the Eglinton Theatre in Toronto. It was the first film to gross over $100 million. By December 1970, it had earned $121.5 million in worldwide rentals, which was over four times higher than the film's estimated break-even point of $29.5 million in rentals. The film was re-released in 1973, and increased its North American rentals to $78.4 million. By the end of the 1970s, it was ranked seventh in all-time North American rentals, having earned $79 million. The film's re-release in 1990 increased the total North American admissions to 142,415,400\u2014the third-highest number of tickets sold behind Gone with the Wind and Star Wars\u2014and about 283.3 million admissions worldwide. The Sound of Music eventually earned a total domestic gross of $163,214,076 and a total worldwide gross of $286,214,076. Adjusted for inflation, the film earned about $2.366 billion at 2014 prices\u2014placing it among the top ten highest-grossing films of all time. The Sound of Music has been included in numerous top film lists from the American Film Institute. The first American television transmission of The Sound of Music was on February 29, 1976, on ABC, which paid $15 million (equivalent to $77,140,351 in 2022) for a one-time only broadcast that became one of the top 20 rated films shown on television to that point with a Nielsen rating of 33.6 and an audience share of 49%. The movie was not shown again until NBC acquired the broadcast rights in June 1977 for $21.5 million for 20 showings over 22 years and telecast the film on February 11, 1979. NBC continued to air the film annually for twenty years. During most of its run on NBC, the film was heavily edited to fit a three-hour time slot\u2014approximately 140 minutes without commercials, which inevitably cut 30 minutes out of the original film. The film aired in its uncut form (minus the entr'acte) on April 9, 1995, on NBC. Julie Andrews hosted the four-hour telecast which presented the musical numbers in a letterboxed format. As the film's home video availability cut into its television ratings, NBC let their contract lapse in 2001. That year, the film was broadcast one time on the Fox network, in its heavily edited 140-minute version. Since 2002, the film has aired on ABC on a Sunday night prior to Christmas and has been broadcast on its sister cable network, Freeform, periodically around Easter and other holidays. Most of its more recent runs have been the full version in a four-hour time slot, complete with the entr'acte. ABC first broadcast a high-definition version on December 28, 2008. On December 22, 2013, the annual broadcast had its highest ratings since 2007; the increase in ratings were credited to NBC's broadcast of The Sound of Music Live!\u2014a live television adaptation of the original musical which aired earlier that month. In the United Kingdom, the film rights were acquired by the BBC, who paid a corporation record $4.1 million, and it was first aired on BBC One on 25 December 1978 and, as of December 2016, fifteen times since, mostly around Christmas time.

The film was also intended to be part of the BBC's programming during the outbreak of nuclear war. The film has been released on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD numerous times. The first DVD version was released on August 29, 2000, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the film's release. The film is often included in box sets with other Rodgers & Hammerstein film adaptations. A 40th anniversary DVD, with \"making of\" documentaries and special features, was released on November 15, 2005. The film made its debut issue on Blu-ray Disc on November 2, 2010, for its 45th anniversary. For the Blu-ray release, the original 70 mm negatives were rescanned at 8K resolution, then restored and remastered at 4K resolution for the transfer to Blu-ray, giving the most detailed copy of the film seen thus far. On March 10, 2015, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released The Sound of Music 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition\u2014a five-disc set featuring thirteen hours of bonus features, including a new documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg. A March 2015 episode of ABC's 20/20 entitled The Untold Story of the Sound of Music featured a preview of the documentary and interviews by Diane Sawyer. In part to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, the film was made available on the Disney+ streaming service upon its debut on November 12, 2019. The Sound of Music film adaptation, like the stage musical, presents a history of the von Trapp family (a.k.a. the Trapp Family) that is not completely accurate. The musical was based on the West German film The Trapp Family (1956) rather than Maria von Trapp's 1949 memoirs, as director Vincent J. Donehue had seen the film and decided that it would make a good vehicle for Mary Martin. The musical followed the film's plot so closely that the New York Times review of the West German film noticed that it \"strongly suggests 'The Sound of Music,' often scene by scene.\" The West German screenwriters made several significant changes to the family's story that were kept in the musical. Maria had been hired to teach just one child, but the 1956 film made her governess to all seven children. The 1965 film adaptation was influenced by other musicals of its era, such as Mary Poppins, the Rodgers and Hammerstein television production of Cinderella, and the stage production of Lerner and Loewe's Camelot (coincidentally all starring Julie Andrews). Screenwriter Ernest Lehman was inspired by the opening of West Side Story and saw the musical as \"a fairy tale that's almost real\". The film incorporated many \"fairy tale\" tropes which included the idyllic imagery (placed in the hills of Salzburg), the European villas, and the cross-class Cinderella-like romance between Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As Maria walks down the aisle to be married, the pageantry is explicitly both Guinevere and Cinderella. In keeping with this tone the filmmakers used artistic license to convey the essence and meaning of their story. Georg Ludwig von Trapp was indeed an anti-Nazi opposed to the Anschluss, and lived with his family in a villa in a district of Salzburg called Aigen. Their lifestyle depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living. The actual family villa, located at Traunstra\u00dfe 34, Aigen 5026, was large and comfortable but not nearly as grand as the mansion depicted in the film. The house was also not their ancestral home, as depicted in the film. The family had previously lived in homes in Zell Am See and Klosterneuburg after being forced to abandon their actual ancestral home in Pola following World War I. Georg moved the family to the Salzburg villa shortly after the death of his first wife, Agathe Whitehead, in 1922. Georg is referred to as \"Captain\" in the film, but he held a noble title of \"Ritter\" (hereditary knight), which had higher social status than a naval officer. Although Austrian nobility was legally abolished in 1919 and the nobiliary particle von was proscribed, both continued to be widely used unofficially as a matter of social courtesy. Georg was offered a position in the German Kriegsmarine; Nazi Germany was looking to expand its fleet of U-boats, and Corvette Captain von Trapp was the most successful Austro-Hungarian submarine commander of World War I, having sunk 11 Allied merchant ships totaling 47,653 GRT and two Allied warships displacing a total of 12,641 tons. With his family in desperate financial straits, he seriously considered the offer before deciding he could not serve a Nazi regime. In the film, Georg is depicted initially as a humorless, emotionally distant father. In reality, third child Maria Franziska von Trapp (\n\nquestion: Where was limited filming done for scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Austria and California", "usage": 1141}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She has a different recollection of her stepmother, Maria Augusta Kutschera, whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage. In a 2003 interview, Maria remembered, \" had a terrible temper... and from one moment to the next, you didn't know what hit her. We were not used to this. But we took it like a thunderstorm that would pass, because the next minute she could be very nice.\" Maria Kutschera had indeed been a novice at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and had been hired by the von Trapp family. However, she was hired only to be a tutor to young Maria Franziska, who had come down with scarlet fever and needed her lessons at home, not to be a governess for all of the children. Maria and Georg married for practical reasons, rather than love and affection for each other. Georg needed a mother for his children, and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey. \"I really and truly was not in love,\" Maria wrote in her memoir, \"I liked him but didn't love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children. I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after.\" They were married in 1927, not in 1938 as depicted in the film, and the couple had been married for over a decade by the time of the Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time. Maria and Georg enjoyed a happy marriage. The von Trapp family lost most of its wealth during the worldwide depression of the early 1930s, when the Austrian national bank folded. In order to survive, the family dismissed the servants and began taking in boarders. They also started singing onstage to earn money, a fact that caused the proud Georg much embarrassment. In the film, the von Trapp family hike over the Alps from Austria to Switzerland to escape the Nazis, which would not have been possible; Salzburg is over two hundred miles from Switzerland. The von Trapp villa, however, was only a few kilometers from the Austria\u2013Germany border, and the final scene shows the family hiking on the Obersalzberg near the German town of Berchtesgaden, within sight of Adolf Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus Eagle's Nest retreat. In reality, the family simply walked to the local train station and boarded a train to Italy. The Trapps were entitled to Italian citizenship since Georg had been born in Zadar, Dalmatia, Austria-Hungary, which had been annexed by Italy after World War I. They were able to emigrate to the United States via the United Kingdom on their Italian passports. The fictional character Max Detweiler, who acted as the scheming family music director in the film, is based on the von Trapps' family priest, the Reverend Franz Wasner, who was their musical director for over twenty years and, unlike Max, accompanied them when they left Austria. The character of Friedrich, the second oldest child in the film version, was based on Rupert, the oldest of the real von Trapp children. Liesl, the oldest child in the film, was based on Agathe von Trapp, the second oldest in the real family. The names and ages of the children were changed, in part because the third child, who would be portrayed as \"Louisa\", was also named Maria, and producers thought that it would be confusing to have two characters called Maria in the film. The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers. Robert Wise met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to Richard Zanuck, that he was not making a \"documentary or realistic movie\" about her family, and that he would make the film with \"complete dramatic freedom\" in order to produce a \"fine and moving film\", one they could all be proud of. Although The Sound of Music is set in Salzburg, it was largely ignored in Austria upon release. The film adaptation was a blockbuster worldwide, but it ran for only three days in Salzburg movie theaters, with locals showing \"disdain\" for a film that \"wasn't authentic.\" In 1966, American Express created the first Sound of Music guided tour in Salzburg. Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been the leading Sound of Music bus tour company in the city, taking approximately 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region. Although the Salzburg tourism industry took advantage of the attention from foreign tourists, residents of the city were apathetic\n\nquestion: Where was limited filming done for scenes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Salzburg was the place with limited scenes.", "usage": 1130}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A German translation of the musical was performed on the national stage for the first time in 2005 at the Vienna Volksoper, receiving negative reviews from Austrian critics, who called it \"boring\" and referred to \"Edelweiss\" as \"an insult to Austrian musical creation.\" The musical finally premiered in Salzburg in 2011 at the Salzburger Landestheater, but Maria was played in the Salzburg premiere by a Dutch actress who \"grew up with the songs.\" However, most performances in Vienna and Salzburg were sold out, and the musical is now in both companies' repertoire. A Sing-along Sound of Music revival screening was first shown at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 1999, leading to a successful run at the Prince Charles Cinema which is ongoing as of 2018. During the screenings, audience members are often dressed as nuns and von Trapp children and are encouraged to sing along to lyrics superimposed on the screen. In July 2000, Sing-along Sound of Music shows opened in Boston, Massachusetts, and Austin, Texas. Some audience members dressed up as cast members and interacted with the action shown on the screen. The film began a successful run at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City in September 2000, with the opening attended by cast members Charmian Carr (Liesl), Daniel Truhitte (Rolfe), and Kym Karath (Gretl). Sing-along Sound of Music screenings have since become an international phenomenon. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The Academy Film Archive preserved The Sound of Music in 2003.

Directed by the multiple Academy Award winning luminary Robert Wise (who also directed \u2018West Side Story\u2019), the film boasted the talents of Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and was phenomenal commercial success, managing to rake in three hundred million dollars way back in the 1960s. Today, the legacy of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is irreproachable, having five Academy Awards to its name and enduring renown that continues to make the film relevant even today. Based on the 1959 stage musical of the same name (which in turn is based on the memoir \u201cThe Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u201d by Maria von Trapp), \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 follows the von Trapp family and their new governess Maria. Maria is a struggling nun who is assigned the job of taking care of the exceedingly mischievous seven von Trapp children. Their father, Georg von Trapp, is a retired naval captain who runs his household with military discipline after the death of his wife. While initially cold and hostile towards Maria, the von Trapp children eventually fall for her kind demeanor and melodious personality. Even the stoic captain finds himself falling for Maria affable charms but their idyllic lifestyle is threatened when the Nazis start to take over their country. If you were wondering what were \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 filming locations, read on. The backdrop for much of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is the charming pre World War II town of Salzburg in Austria during the 1930s. The scenery shows off distant snow-capped mountain peaks, verdant hilltops perfect for breaking into a spontaneous melody, and cultured medieval buildings that occupy the imagination. While it is possible to recreate these distinctive features of the region on a set as well, such a facsimile is unlikely to be nearly as authentic as the real thing. This is especially true of the 1960s when CGI wasn\u2019t really an option for filmmakers. Keeping this in mind, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 was largely filmed on location in Austria itself, specifically in the city of Salzburg. Limited filming for scenes was also done in studio in California, as well as a few scenes in Bavaria, Germany. Principal filming commenced in late March 1964 and concluded later that year in September.

The production started out with the filming of Maria\u2019s bedroom scenes as well as the nun Abbey cloister. Sketch artist Maurice Zuberano accompanied director Robert Wise to scout for locations in Austria. After a ten week period, Zuberano prepared a set of storyboards and location photos to art director Boris Leven, who designed and constructed the interior sets at Fox Studios in painstaking detail. It is on these sets that parts of the gazebo scenes in the wildly popular songs \u201cSomething Good\u201d and \u201cSixteen Going on Seventeen\u201d were filmed. The 20th century Fox Studios have served as the filming location for many world renowned films and TV shows including \u2018Modern Family\u2019, \u2018Fight Club\u2019, \u2018Edward Scissorhands\u2019, and \u2018Arrested Development\u2019. The majority of the filming for \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 took place in and around the delightful city of Salzburg in Austria. The wedding scenes were filmed at the Benedictine monastery of Mondsee Abbey in Upper Austria, with on location filming also done at Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and the Altstadt Old Town area of Salzburg.

Start Traveling. Austria \u2022 See & Do One of the most famous musical films, The Sound of Music, which was filmed in 1965 is still loved by many today. Each year hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Salzburg, Austria to walk in the footsteps of the legendary Von Trapp family. If you are a fan of the movie and wondering where the Sound of Music was filmed, you\u2019ve come to the right place. From the gazebo where Liesl sings \u201c16 going on 17\u201d to the Abbey where Maria lived and got married, here are all the must-visit Sound of Music filming locations. Recommendation: Relive the scenes of some of the most popular Sound of Music locations in Salzburg including Leopoldskron Palace, Nonnberg Abbey, and Mirabell Gardens on a guided Sound of Music tour. With an English speaking guide, and songs from the soundtrack playing throughout the tour, this Original Sound of Music tour from Salzburg won\u2019t disappoint! Marvel at the breathtaking locations for the Sound of Music and sing through the streets of Salzburg. Founded in 714 A.D., Nonnberg Abbey (German: Stift Nonnberg) is the oldest female convent north of the Alps and is where the real-life Maria became a novice nun and got married to Georg von Trapp. Nonnberg is where four scenes from the movie were filmed: the scene of the nuns singing \u201cMaria\u201d in the courtyard, Maria leaving the abbey, the kids visiting her at the abbey, and the Nazi\u2019s hunting the Von Trapps. Visitors will notice the interior of the Abbey is different from the movie, as filming inside the convent was not allowed, so the interior scenes were shot in a Hollywood studio. A highlight of this Sound of Music location in Salzburg is hearing the resident nuns Gregorian chants in Latin at 6:45 in the morning inside the beautiful Gothic abbey. The small yet beautiful flower filled St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery (German: Petersfriedhof) was the inspiration for the cemetery rebuilt on set for the scene towards the end of the movie in which the Von Trapps hide from the Nazis behind tombs. Beside being the resting place of Mozart\u2019s sister, Nannerl, this is also the resting place of Max Detweiler, \u201cUncle Max\u201d from the movie. This unique cemetery is one of the oldest (and most beautiful) cemeteries in the world and is Salzburg\u2019s oldest Christian cemetery. The catacombs carved out of the rocks of M\u00f6nchsberg provide a stunning view over the beautiful cemetery and should be visited during your Sound of Music tour in Salzburg. This baroque style garden, which was built in 1606 by the archbishop Wolf Dietrich for his mistress is a beautifully landscaped garden filled with gorgeous flowers, marble statues, fountains, and ample opportunities to reenact scenes from the movies. The iconic song, \u201cDo Re, Mi\u201d was partially shot here. While visiting Mirabell gardens, you\u2019ll relive the scene of Maria and the Von Trapp kids dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, jumping up and down the steps, as well as running through the hedge maze tunnel, all the while admiring the breathtaking view of Hohensalzburg Fortress in the distance. This film location spot, which can be visited for free, should not be missed. Situated in the center of Salzburg old town is Residence Square (German: Residenzplatz), which is home to the largest (45 feet tall) baroque fountain outside of Italy. It is in this square while singing \u201cI Have Confidence in Me\u201d, that Maria happily splashes water in the fountain, The Nazi soliders also march through the square later in the movie and hang their flag over the entrance of the old Residence Palace. Built in the 17th century to wash the horses of the prince-archbishop, the Horse Pond (German: Pferdeschwemme) was briefly featured in the movie as a backdrop to Maria and the kids singing \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d while dancing in their clothes made from curtains. In addition to being featured in the musical, the Horse Pond is well worth a visit in its own right. It is situation below the cliff side of M\u00f6nchsberg, and the bright fresco behind the horse pond makes for a gorgeous picture to add to your Sound of Music tour album. Carved into the M\u00f6nchsberg, the Rock Riding School (German: Felsenreitschule) was initially built to be a cathedral, but was later repurposed by the archbishop into a riding school where tournaments were held. Today it\u2019s Salzburg\u2019s most popular concert venue and is where the real Von Trapp family won the Sal\n\nquestion: What does the movie showcase about Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The movie showcases a variety of Salzburg locations, including the Mirabell Gardens, Residence Square, and Nonnberg Abbey.", "usage": 1087}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Fans will recognize this Sound of Music filming location from the scene where the Captain sings \u201cEdelweiss\u201d and his family joins him on stage to sing \u201cSo Long, Farewell\u201d. Frohnburg Palace played an important role in the Sound of Music as it was one of the two filming locations for the Von Trapp Villa. Once a private residence, the palace is now a Music Academy, the facade and large iron gate is where Maria first set her eyes on the Von Trapp family home towards the end of the song \u201cI Have Confidence\u201d. The Palace was also featured in the movie during the scenes in which the Captain rips the Nazi flag from above the doorway and during the family\u2019s attempt to escape from the Nazis by pushing their car silently out of the gate. Just outside the city center is Hellbrunn Palace, home to the Sound of Music gazebo. It was here that the most romantic scenes of the Sound of Music was captured; when Liesl gets her first kiss while singing \u201c16 going on 17.\u201d It is also where the Captain and Maria fall deeper in love with each other while singing \u201cSomething Good\u201d. Though visitors cannot go into the gazebo, they can dance, sing, and take as many pictures as they please around it. Make your visit to Hellbrunn even more exciting by taking a tour of the Trick Fountains at Hellbrunn Palace. The hour long tour takes you through grottoes, ponds, and walkways filled with trick fountains. Your ticket also lets you explore the inside of the palace. This is one of the best things to do in Salzburg and will be a memorable experience especially for the kids. Leopoldskron Palace is one of the most important filming location for the Sound of Music as the majestic palace and perfect lake view backdrop served as the primary filming location for all of the lake terrace scenes of the Von Trapp family home. This includes the scenes in which Maria and the kids fall off the boat into the lake, and when the Captain and Uncle Max are drinking pink lemonade on the terrace. Though the interior of the mansion was never filmed in the movie, the palace\u2019s gold Venetian ballroom and foyer were rebuilt in Hollywood for the interior scenes. Today the palace is a boutique hotel. Staying overnight is the only way to visit the film location up close and to get a peek into the Venetian ballroom. Staying here is the ultimate Sound of Music experience as you get to live in the home of the Von Trapp family in the film. You can book your stay at Leopoldskron Palace here. If you choose not to stay at the hotel, you can still view the Palace at a distance from the west side of the lake. Though not a filming location, the Von Trapp Villa is where the real Von Trapp family lived for 15 years. They managed to get onto a train at the nearby station to escape the Nazis one day before the Austrian borders were closed. Today the Von Trapp Villa operates as a hotel and an educational Sound of Music museum of the real Von Trapp family as well as behind the scenes information about the filming of the movie. Not far from Leopoldskron Palace, a visit to the Von Trapp Villa would give fans a true insight on the life of the legendary Von Trapp family that we have come to love. Fans can either book a stay at the Villa or simply visit on a guided tour which takes place every day and lasts about 45 minutes. Mt. Untersberg is depicted twice in the Sound of Music, once during the opening scene in which Maria is singing the \u201cSound of Music\u201d and again when the family is escaping over the mountain to Switzerland while singing \u201cClimb Every Mountain\u201d. Fans can easily access Mount Untersberg from Salzburg via bus and get to the top via cable car. More adventurous travelers can hike 2 hours to the top. At 1,853 meters above the Salzburg basin, Mt. Untersberg offers breaktaking views over the region and is worth the day trip from Salzburg. Less than an hour bus drive from Salzburg is the picturesque lakeside town Mondsee. There you can visit the beautiful Collegiate Church of St. Michael where Maria and Georg von Trapp got married in the movie. This is a must-see for any Sound of Music fan. Make a full-day trip out of the location and stroll through the town, take a refreshing dip in the lake, hike up the nearby forest, and eat delicious seafood along the lake. In the opening scene of the movie you get a gorgeous aerial view of the village of St. Gilgen and the popular lake, Wolfgangsee. The village and lake can easily be reached by train.

Make your trip to Werfen a full day adventure by visiting both the Hohenwerfen Fortress and the largest ice cave in the world, Eisriesenwelt. Both sights will be a welcome addition to your Salzburg itinerary. Situated just across the German border, atop the magnificent Rossfeld mountain, is the Rossfeld Panoramic Road which was used in the movie to show the safe escape of the Von Trapp family across the nearby Untersberg Mountain. The private road, Rossfeld Panoramic Road is the only filming location that\u2019s difficult to get to without a car. If you don\u2019t have a car, it is recommended to visit the nearby Untersberg Mountain to get just as spectacular views with easier accessibility. Well there you have it, the top must-visit Sound of Music filming location in and around Salzburg. All locations can be visited on your own, but if you don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle or you have limited time, consider taking a guided Sound of Music tour from Salzburg or Vienna. And to make your Sound of Music trip even more memorable, spend a night or two at the home of the Von Trapp family in the film; Hotel Schloss Leopoldskron, or in the home of the real Von Trapp family at Villa Trapp. Either one will take your trip from amazing to extraordinary. Waseem says 1 month ago The Sound of Music gazebo at Hellbrunn Palace in Salzburg was moved here from its original location at Schloss Leopoldskron. Allan Trivette says 5 months ago The writer/compiler of this page shows an obvious love for the film. I was put under a \u201cSound of Music\u201d spell at the age of 10 when the film first came out, and I\u2019m still spellbound to this day. I\u2019ve visited Salzburg 5 times, and I can\u2019t wait to go back again. But, there are a few errors on this page that need to be clarified and/or corrected. First \u2013 #7 Frohnburg Palace \u2013 the writer of this article is correct \u2013 it WAS used as the von Trapp home in the film. However, what we see in the film as the FRONT of the von Trapp home is actually the BACK of Frohnburg! The FRONT of Frohnburg was used as the BACK of the von Trapp home in the film! The back of the home is seen when Rolf comes to deliver a telegram and the Captain takes it abruptly and tells him to leave. You see it also when the pink lemonade is served. Now, to make this even more complicated, the back of the film home looking toward the lake: the canoe flipping, the Baroness and the Captain strolling by the lake, Leisl running out to meet Rolf, Maria\u2019s return when she comes back from the Abbey, etc., is located to the left of Schloss Leopoldskron. I\u2019ll write more about this below. #8 \u2013 Hellbrun Palace (the gazebo) \u2013 correction \u2013 NONE of the gazebo scenes (\u201c16 Going on 17\u201d and \u201cSomething Good\u201d) were shot anywhere near the gazebo. It was a set in Hollywood. The only time we see the gazebo that is at Hellbrun is when the Captain and the Baroness take their stroll by the lake (just before the canoe flipping). It can be seen briefly in the background during their stroll. #9 \u2013 Leopoldskron Palace \u2013 was NOT used at ALL at any time during the filming!! The production company DID want to film the lake scenes there, but the officials of the Palace at that time wanted too much money. They did, however, offer the company the use of the \u201cside lawn\u201d. If you look at the photo of the Palace on this page, the side lawn is not seen, but it is to the left of the photo\u2019s edge. The \u201cOfficial Sound of Music Tour\u201d guides will show you the Schloss and point out the original horse-headed statues and lake gate and tell you that is where those scenes were filmed. WRONG!!! The \u201clake-gate\u201d and the horse-headed fish statues, were recreated by 20th Century-Fox and erected on the \u201cside lawn\u201d where the Meierhof is now located.

There is a roadside cafe/restaurant on the Panoramastrasse called the Ahornkaser (they serve the best Apple Strudel you\u2019ll ever have). Standing in front of the Ahornkaser, there is a path on the right side of the building. Take that path about 400 feet and look up to your right. At the top of the hill is the exact spot where the von Trapps cross the mountain to freedom as \u201cClimb Ev\u2019ry Mountain\u201d is sung. At the end of that scene, with that open vista lying before them, you can see the Untersberg in the distance. I hope this helps/informs anyone planning on making a visit. Negar Modgeddi says 1 month ago I LOVE your notations about the actual places and your very thoughtful corrections! Melanie says 6 months ago Thank you for this great information! Do you know which field Maria was walking in during the opening scene? I know it was Untersberg Mountain in the background, but I can\u2019t find any information on the field she was frolicking through to get that sweeping view. Any pointers you can offer would be most appreciated! Ben says 6 months ago The opening scene was filmed on Mehlweg meadow which is not open to the public. Frans says 2 years ago The horsepond also features in a scene where Liesl runs into Rolf on his bike. lucy says 2 years ago This has been the most helpful and clear information i\u2019ve found about the filming locations thanks so much Your email address will not be published.

The opening aerial shots are Salzburg\u2019s glorious Lake District, the Salzkammergut. The castles you can see are Kloster H\u00f6glw\u00f6rth, an old monastery on a peninsula in H\u00f6glw\u00f6rther See; and Schloss Anif, off E55 a few miles south of Salzburg. The mountain, atop which Maria (Julie Andrews) makes her first twirling appearance, is Mehlweg, near the Bavarian village of Markt Schellenberg, about six miles from Salzburg. Don\u2019t be too disappointed \u2013 the birch trees and the babbling brook were added for the movie. Convent interiors were recreated in the studio, but the exterior really is Maria\u2019s abbey. It\u2019s Nonnberg Abbey, Nonnberg Gasse, where you can visit the courtyard and peek inside the chapel (which looks nothing like the interior recreated back in Hollywood). The film cheats a little with the exterior, too. As you\u2019ll find if you visit, the real Nonnberg Abbey doesn\u2019t look out over the picturesque old town of Salzburg, but to the nondescript southern suburbs. The reverse shot, of Maria leaving the abbey, filmed way across the city on the Humboldt Terrace (seen later in the Do Re Mi number), in front of the Museum of Modern Art, which since 2002 has stood atop M\u00f6nchsberg Cliffs on the site of the old Cafe Winkler. As Maria leaves to take up her post with the Von Trapp family, I Have Confidence in Me was filmed in Salzburg\u2019s Old Town, in the Residenzplatz, where you\u2019ll see the Domplatz arches, through which Maria enters, and the Residenz Fountain, in which she splashes. The \u2018Villa Von Trapp\u2019 is a combination of two different Salzburg locations. The tree-shaded lane, where Maria alights from the bus, is Hellbrunner Allee, running south from the old town. Here you\u2019ll recognise Schloss Frohnburg, a 17th century country house, now the Mozarteum Music Academy, which was used for the intimidating gates and front entrance of the villa which Maria nervously approaches. The lakeside terrace, though, was filmed at Schloss Leopoldskron, a rococo castle on Leopoldskroner Teich, a small artificial lake on the southwest of the town. You can view Leopoldskron across the lake from K\u00f6nig Ludwig Strasse, but it's now \u2013 hurrah! \u2013 a hotel. Leopoldskron's extravagantly gilt Venetian Room was replicated in the studio in Hollywood. Incidentally, the famous gazebo originally stood on the palace's grounds, when it was a private villa, but was moved to a more accessible location. The real Villa Trapp, by the way, is in Aigen, a suburb just to the southeast of the Old Town of Salzburg. Since 2008, it\u2019s been open as a hotel, Villa Trapp, Traunstra\u00dfe 34, 5026 Salzburg. There\u2019s a rail service to Bahnhof Aigen. The little footbridge over which the von Trapps skip at the beginning of the My Favourite Things montage of Salzburg is Mozart Steg, north of Mozart Platz. They quickly move on to Domplatz, in front of Salzburger Dom (Salzburg Cathedral); Kapitelschwemme, the Baroque horse pond once used for watering and cleaning horses, in Herbert von Karajan Platz; and the market on Kajetanerplatz, just north of Nonnberg Abbey, where Maria demonstrates her tomato juggling skills. They finally head off for a picnic in the meadow above the village of Werfen, 25 miles south of Salzburg in the Salzach River valley (where you can also visit the castle from wartime action movie Where Eagles Dare). Do-Re-Mi begins at the picnic, returning to Salzburg atop the Monchsberg Cliffs, on Humboldt Terrace which you can reach from the Monchsberg elevator in Anton Neumayrplatz, at the end of the Gstattengasse shopping street, and continuing with a carriage ride south from St Erhard Kirche, the Parish Church of St Erhard, along Nonntaler Hauptstra\u00dfe,\n\nquestion: What does the movie showcase about Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The movie showcases real locations around Salzburg, Austria, as well as some recreated locations in 20th Century-Fox studios in Hollywood.", "usage": 1063}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The number climaxes at Mirabell Gardens, on Schwarzstrasse, over the Salzach River behind Schloss Mirabell, where you\u2019ll find the fountains, statues and, famously, the flight of steps on which the children hop. The Von Trapp gazebo, used for Sixteen Going On Seventeen, once stood in the grounds of Leopoldskron, but constant trespassing resulted in it being moved and reconstructed in the ornamental gardens of Schloss Hellbrunn, Morzger Strasse, toward the south of Salzburg. And another cheat. It was recreated, slightly larger, back at 20th Century-Fox in Hollywood for the interior shots. Maria\u2019s wedding, which took place in Nonnberg Abbey, was filmed in the baroque, twin-towered St Michael\u2019s Church, Wredeplatz, in Mondsee, about 15 miles east of Salzburg on the E55/E60. The Anschluss scene, Austria\u2019s enforced unity with Nazi Germany, was staged back in the centre of Salzburg itself in Residenzplatz. The music festival, at which the von Trapp family perform their disappearing act, is at the Felsenreitschule (\u2018Rock Riding School\u2019), Hofstallgasse 1, a 1400-seat theatre built in what was a rock quarry for Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun in 1693, and used as the archbishop's riding school. It\u2019s one of the sites of the Salzburg Festival. Despite what some overenthusiastic tour guides might tell you, the cemetery in which the von Trapps hide from the Nazis is a Hollywood studio set, though its design is clearly based on St Peter\u2019s Graveyard, which you can see just off Kapitelplatz. The mountain over which the family finally escapes to freedom is above the village of Obersalzburg with views of the Untersberg in the distance, near the village of Rossfeld, on the 319, 12 miles south of Salzburg. \u2022 Many thanks to Lieselotte Mayrhofer; and to Bryan Crawford of Edelweiss Tours for help with this section.

Adapted from the 1959 stage musical of the same name, \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 is actually based on the memoir, titled \u2018The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\u2019. The story deals with a postulant, who goes to the imposing home of a retired naval officer. The man is a widower, and the young woman acts as a governess to his children. Soon enough, she brings music and love to the entire family, and it is not long before she falls in love with her employer as well. Together they band, as they have to face the loss of their motherland to the Nazis. If you have seen the movie, you already know that it takes place in Salzburg in Austria. Over the course of the film, there are several iconic scenes that have been shot at picturesque locations, or there are some locations that have been simply elevated due to the value of the scene itself (think of the gazebo where \u2018Sixteen Going on Seventeen\u2019 is performed). Naturally, you might be wondering about the exact filming locations of this popular movie, and we have got you covered in that regard. When \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 started filming, the crew did not head immediately to the real locations for the movie. Instead, when principal photography began on March 26, 1964, it started at the 20th Century Fox studios located in Los Angeles. Following this, the crew headed to Salzburg, where they filmed at a variety of locations including the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, and Residence Fountain, among others. Filming commenced here from April 23, to around May 22. Various other locations nearby were used, and shooting went on till around June 19. The crew also hit up places nearby including Werfen in the Salzach River valley. Some scenes were also shot in Bavaria, with the Alps serving as a wonderful backdrop. Around July 6, the team headed back to Los Angeles for the remaining scenes, and principal photography ultimately wrapped up by September 1, 1964. As is evident, a plethora of locations have been hit in this frenzied shooting schedule, and we now proceed to the specific filming locations, rendered memorable by the iconic scenes that have unfolded there. Salzburg in Austria serves as the place where most of the pivotal scenes of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place. Some of the most recognizable locations include Mirabell Palace and Gardens. If you\u2019ve seen the movie, you must know that \u2018Do re mi\u2019 is one of the most popular songs. The ending of this song sees Maria and the von Trapp kids at the Mirabell Palace and Gardens. Located in Salzburg\u2019s old town, we can see the movie characters dancing around the Pegasus Fountain, which is located in front of the palace. The other recognizable locations happen to be the rose garden at the north of the fountain and the Greek fencing statues at the entrance. Residenzplatz Square and Fountain also plays an important part, early on, as Maria can be seen splashing in the baroque horse fountain here, while \u2018I Have Confidence in Me\u2019 is playing. When Germany annexes Austria, we see Nazi soldiers marching through this square, while a Swastika flag is raised above the Old Residence Palace\u2019s entrance. The Summer Riding School (Felsenreitschule) is where the von Trapp family takes the stage, performing \u2018Edelweiss\u2019 and \u2018So long, Farewell\u2019, for the Folk Festival. Notably, hundreds of extras were hired for the scene to sing along. A little away from this location, on Herbert von Karajan Square, is the Horse Pond, where Maria and the children dance at the end of \u2018My Favorite Things\u2019. Leopoldskron Palace is important in its own way since all the lake terrace scenes of the von Trapp family home were shot here. Schloss Frohnburg was also used to show the von Trapp house, rather the intimidating front gates which Maria nervously approaches initially. Nonnberg Abbey Convent is where Maria lived, and the exteriors of the same have been used in the movie. However, the movie has taken some liberties here, as the convent does not actually look over the old town of Salzburg, but instead has a view of the nondescript southern suburbs. St. Michael Basilica in Mondsee, outside Salzburg, is remarkable because Maria gets married to Georg von Trapp, in one of the most famous scenes from the movie. Werfen, which is around a 40-minute drive away from Salzburg, has the Gschwandtanger Meadow, which\n\nquestion: What does the movie showcase about Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The movie showcases various iconic locations in Salzburg, Austria such as Mirabell Palace and Gardens, Residenzplatz Square and Fountain, Summer Riding School (Felsenreitschule), Leopoldskron Palace, Schloss Frohnburg, Nonnberg Abbey Convent, and St. Michael Basilica in Mondsee.", "usage": 1147}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Bavaria is important for being one of the first scenes where Maria makes her entrance. She can be seen twirling at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg. The sequence where the von Trapps escape the Nazis is also shot on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. Notably, Stage 8 and Stage 15 were used in the studios, but a lot of important scenes were shot there. Firstly, shooting inside the convent was not allowed, meaning that the set was created in the studio itself. The golden foyer and the ballroom, we see in the house, were also recreated in Hollywood. There is an important scene where the Von Trapp family hides from the Nazis behind some tombs. While the scenes have been recreated in Hollywood, they closely resemble St. Peter\u2019s Cemetery and Catacombs in Salzburg. The gazebo where two of the finest songs in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 take place, that is, \u2018Something Good\u2019 and \u201916 going on 17\u2032, is actually both a real-life location as well as something created in a studio. The real-life gazebo is near the Eastern entrance to the Hellbrunn Palace. A larger one was rebuilt in Hollywood where most of the scenes were actually shot. As is evident, the scenes in \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 have been carefully shot to capture the beauty of the location and to transport us into this enchanting world inhabited by the von Trapp family and Maria. Making the best use of the locations is just one small aspect that has helped this film go down in history as one of the most memorable examples of great cinema.

The film is an adaptation of the 1959 stage musical, composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and a book by Lindsay and Crouse. Based on the 1949 memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers by Maria von Trapp, the film is set in Salzburg, Austria and is a fictional retelling of her experiences as governess to seven children, her eventual marriage with their father Captain Georg Von Trapp, and their escape during the Anschluss in 1938. Filming took place from March to September 1964 in Los Angeles and Salzburg. The Sound of Music was released on March 2, 1965, in the United States, initially as a limited roadshow theatrical release. Although initial critical response to the film was mixed, it was a major commercial success, becoming the number one box office film after four weeks, and the highest-grossing film of 1965. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all-time\u2014surpassing Gone with the Wind\u2014and held that distinction for five years. The film was just as popular throughout the world, breaking previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries. Following an initial theatrical release that lasted four and a half years, and two successful re-releases, the film sold 283 million admissions worldwide and earned a total worldwide gross of $286 million. The Sound of Music received five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Wise's second pair of both awards, the first being from the 1961 film West Side Story. The film also received two Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture and Best Actress, the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. In 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) listed The Sound of Music as the fifty-fifth greatest American film of all time, and the fourth-greatest film musical. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg in 1938. Her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern. Mother Abbess sends Maria to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children\u2014Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children out of drapes that are to be changed. She takes them around Salzburg and the mountains while teaching them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake which concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain attempts to fire Maria. However, he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. The Captain apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay. Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes that he enters them in the upcoming Salzburg Festival, but the Captain disapproves of letting his children sing in public. During a grand party at the villa, where guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional L\u00e4ndler folk dance, he steps in and partners Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy by indirectly convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. However, Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, so she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her purpose in life. When Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. However, the Baroness learns that the Captain's feelings\n\nquestion: What does the movie showcase about Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1120}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

While the couple is on their honeymoon, Max enters the children into the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. Having learned that Austria has been annexed by the Third Reich, the couple return to their home, where the Captain receives a telegram, ordering him to report to the German Naval base at Bremerhaven to accept a commission in the Kriegsmarine. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and their ideology, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. That night, the von Trapp family attempt to flee to Switzerland, but they are stopped by a group of Brownshirts, led by the Gauleiter Hans Zeller, waiting outside the villa. To cover his family's tracks, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven. Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slips away and seeks shelter at the abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Zeller and his men soon arrive and search the abbey, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When they attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start, as two of the nuns have sabotaged their engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom. The real Maria von Trapp has a brief uncredited cameo as a passerby, alongside her children Rosmarie and Werner von Trapp during \"I Have Confidence\". The Sound of Music story is based on Maria von Trapp's memoir The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, published in 1949 to help promote her family's singing group following the death of her husband Georg in 1947. Hollywood producers expressed interest in purchasing the title only, but Maria refused, wanting her entire story to be told. In 1956, German producer Wolfgang Liebeneiner purchased the film rights for $9,000 (equivalent to $97,000 in 2022), hired George Hurdalek and Herbert Reinecker to write the screenplay, and Franz Grothe to supervise the soundtrack, which consisted of traditional Austrian folk songs. The Trapp Family was released in West Germany on October 9, 1956, and became a major success. Two years later, Liebeneiner directed a sequel, The Trapp Family in America, and the two pictures became the most successful films in West Germany during the post-war years. Their popularity extended throughout Europe and South America. In 1956, Paramount Pictures purchased the United States film rights, intending to produce an English-language version with Audrey Hepburn as Maria. The studio eventually dropped its option, but one of its directors, Vincent J. Donehue, proposed the story as a stage musical for Mary Martin. Producers Richard Halliday and Leland Heyward secured the rights and hired playwrights Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, who had won the Pulitzer Prize for State of the Union. They approached Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II to compose one song for the musical, but the composers felt the two styles\u2014traditional Austrian folk songs and their composition\u2014would not work together. They offered to write a completely new score for the entire production if the producers were willing to wait while they completed work on Flower Drum Song. The producers quickly responded that they would wait as long as necessary. The Sound of Music stage musical opened on November 16, 1959, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York City and ran on Broadway for 1,443 performances, winning six Tony Awards, including Best Musical. In June 1960, Twentieth Century-Fox purchased the film adaptation rights to the stage musical for $1.25 million (equivalent to $12,400,000 in 2022) against ten percent of the gross. In December 1962, 20th Century-Fox president Richard D. Zanuck hired Ernest Lehman to write the screenplay for the film adaptation of the stage musical. Lehman reviewed the original script for the stage musical, rearranged the sequence of songs, and began transforming a work designed for the stage into a film that could use the camera to emphasize action and mood and open the story up to the beautiful locations of Salzburg and the Austrian Alps. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" sequence in the play, for example, was originally a stagnant number; Lehman transformed it into a lively montage showing some of the beautiful sites of Salzburg, as well as showing Maria and the children growing closer over time. Lehman also eliminated two songs, \"How Can Love Survive?\" and \"No Way to Stop It\", sung by the characters of Elsa and Max. In January 1963, he saw the Fox English-d\n\nquestion: What does the movie showcase about Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1128}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Not especially impressed, he decided to use the stage musical and Maria's memoir for most of his source material. While Lehman was developing the screenplay, he and Zanuck began looking for a director. Their first choice was Robert Wise, with whom Lehman had worked on the film adaptation of West Side Story, but Wise was busy preparing work for another film, The Sand Pebbles. Other directors were approached and turned down the offer, including Stanley Donen, Vincent J. Donehue, George Roy Hill, and Gene Kelly. In January 1963, Lehman invited one of his favorite directors, William Wyler, to travel to New York City with him to see the Broadway musical. After seeing the show, Wyler said he hated it, but after two weeks of Lehman's persuasion, Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film. After hiring musical supervisor Roger Edens, Wyler, Lehman, and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations. In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy-five locations\u2014an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences. During that trip, Lehman began to have reservations about Wyler's commitment to the project and communicated this to Zanuck, who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible. Lehman completed the first draft on September 10, 1963, and sent it to Wyler, who had no suggestions or changes to add. At that time, Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise, whom Lehman still wanted as the director. Later that month, Wyler's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct The Collector. Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film, and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director, ending Wyler's participation. Meanwhile, Wise, whose film The Sand Pebbles had been postponed, read Lehman's first draft, was impressed by what he read, and agreed to direct the film, joining the picture in October 1963, and flew to Salzburg with associate producer Saul Chaplin and members of his production team to scout filming locations, including many that Wyler had identified. When he returned, Wise began working on the script. Wise shared Lehman's vision of the film being centered on the music, and the changes he made were consistent with the writer's approach\u2014mainly reducing the amount of sweetness and sentimentality found in the stage musical. He had reservations about Lehman's opening aerial sequence because West Side Story, whose screenplay Lehman had also written, had used a similar opening sequence, but he was unable to think of a better one and decided to keep Lehman's. Other changes included replacing \"An Ordinary Couple\" with a more romantic number, and a new song for Maria's departure from the abbey\u2014Rodgers provided \"Something Good\" and \"I Have Confidence\", especially for the film. Lehman completed the second draft on December 20, 1963, but additional changes would be made based on input from Maria von Trapp and Christopher Plummer about the character of the Captain. Plummer especially helped change a character lacking substance into a stronger, more forceful complex figure with a wry sense of humor and a darker edge. Lehman completed his final draft on March 20, 1964. Lehman's first and only choice for Maria was Julie Andrews. When Wise joined the project, he made a list of his choices for the role, which included Andrews as his first choice, Grace Kelly, and Shirley Jones. Wise and Lehman went to Disney Studios to view footage from Mary Poppins, which was not yet released. A few minutes into the film, Wise told Lehman, \"Let's go sign this girl before somebody else sees this film and grabs her!\" Andrews had some reservations\u2014mainly about the amount of sweetness in the theatrical version\u2014but when she learned that her concerns were shared by Wise and Lehman and what their vision was, she signed a contract with Fox to star in The Sound of Music and one other film for $225,000 (equivalent to $2,120,000 in 2022). Wise had a more difficult time casting the role of the Captain. A number of actors were considered for the part, including Bing Crosby, Yul Brynner, Sean Connery, and Richard Burton. Wise had seen Christopher Plummer on Broadway and wanted him for the role, but the stage actor turned down the offer several times. Wise flew to London to meet with Plummer and explained his concept of the film; the actor accepted after being assured that he could work with Lehman to improve the character. Wise also spent considerable time and effort on casting the secondary characters. For the role of Max Detweiler, Wise initially considered Victor Borge, No\u00ebl Coward, and Hal Holbrook among others before deciding on Richard Haydn.

The casting of the children's characters began in November 1963 and involved over two hundred interviews and auditions throughout the United States and England. Some of the child actors interviewed or tested, who were not selected, included Mia Farrow, Patty Duke, Lesley Ann Warren, Geraldine Chaplin, Shelley Fabares, Teri Garr, Kurt Russell, and The Osmonds. Most of the actors selected had some acting, singing, or dancing experience. Charmian Carr, however, was a model who worked part-time in a doctor's office and had no ambition to pursue a career as an actress. After a friend sent her photo to Wise's office, she was asked to interview. Wise later recalled, \"She was so pretty and had such poise and charm that we liked her immediately.\" The last person to be cast was Daniel Truhitte in the role of Rolfe. Rehearsals for the singing and dance sequences began on February 10, 1964. The husband-and-wife team of Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, who had worked with Andrews on Mary Poppins, worked out the choreography with Saul Chaplin on piano\u2014the arrangements could not be altered under Rodgers and Hammerstein's contract. The stage choreography was not used because it was too restrictive. Breaux and Wood worked out all-new choreography better suited for the film that incorporated many of the Salzburg locations and settings. They even choreographed the newly added puppet dance sequence for \"The Lonely Goatherd\". The choreography for the L\u00e4ndler strictly followed the traditional Austrian folk dance. The musical arranger Irwin Kostal prerecorded the songs with a large orchestra and singers on a stage before the start of filming. In her book, The Sound of Music: The Making of America's Favorite Movie, Julia Antopol Hirsch says that Kostal used seven children and five adults to record the children's voices; the only scene in which the child-actors' singing is heard in the released version of the film is when they sing \"The Sound of Music\" on their own after Maria leaves. Charmian Carr refuted the claim that the voices of the child actors were dubbed in the film and on the soundtrack. Carr contended that all of the children who are in the film sing on the track, but four other children were added to most of the songs to give them a fuller sound; they did not replace them as singers. The voices of some of the adult actors had voice doubles, including those of Peggy Wood and Christopher Plummer. Principal photography began on March 26, 1964, at 20th Century-Fox studios in Los Angeles, where scenes from Maria's bedroom and the abbey cloister and graveyard were filmed. The company then flew to Salzburg, where filming resumed on April 23 at Mondsee Abbey for the wedding scenes. From April 25 through May 22, scenes were filmed at the Felsenreitschule, Nonnberg Abbey, Mirabell Palace Gardens, Residence Fountain, and various street locations throughout the Altstadt (Old Town) area of the city. Wise faced opposition from city leaders who did not want him staging scenes with swastika banners. They relented after he threatened instead to include old newsreel footage featuring the banners. On days when it rained, a constant challenge for the company, Wise arranged for scenes to be shot at St. Margarethen Chapel and D\u00fcrer Studios (Reverend Mother's office). From May 23 to June 7, the company worked at Schloss Leopoldskron and an adjacent property called Bertelsmann for scenes representing the lakeside terrace and gardens of the von Trapp villa. From June 9 to 19, scenes were shot at Frohnburg Palace, which represented the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa. Karath could not swim and was in danger during the capsizing boat scene. The \"Do-Re-Mi\" picnic scene in the mountains was filmed above the town of Werfen in the Salzach River valley on June 25 and 27. The opening sequence of Maria on her mountain was filmed from June 28 to July 2 at Mehlweg mountain near the town of Marktschellenberg in Bavaria. During filming, Birch trees were added and then removed. The brook she walks through was plastic filled with water which was put there during filming. The final scene of the von Trapp family escaping over the mountains was filmed on the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. The cast and crew flew back to Los Angeles and resumed filming at Fox Studios on July 6 for all remaining scenes, including those in the villa dining room, ballroom, terrace, living room, and gazebo. Following the last two scenes shot in the gazebo\u2014for the songs \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Sevent\n\nquestion: What does the movie showcase about Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The city scenes and backgrounds.", "usage": 1122}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A total of eighty-three scenes were filmed in just over five months. Post-production work began on August 25 with three weeks of dialogue dubbing to correct lines that were ruined by various street noises and rain. In October, Christopher Plummer's singing voice was dubbed by veteran Disney playback singer Bill Lee. The film was then edited by Wise and film editor William Reynolds. Once the film was edited, Irwin Kostal, who orchestrated the musical numbers, underscored the film with background music consisting of variations on Rodgers and Hammerstein's original songs to amplify or add nuances to the visual images. When dubbing, editing, and scoring were complete, Wise arranged for two sneak-preview showings\u2014the first one held in Minneapolis on Friday, January 15, 1965 at the Mann Theater, and the second one held the following night in Tulsa. Despite the \"sensational\" responses from the preview audiences, Wise made a few final editing changes before completing the film. According to the original print information for the film, the running time for the theatrical release version was 174 minutes. The film was still in release when the Motion Picture Association of America's film ratings system was implemented in 1968, and was subsequently given a \"G\" rating (\"general audiences\") in 1969. The Sound of Music was filmed in Todd-AO by Ted McCord and produced with DeLuxe Color processing. Aerial footage was photographed with an MCS-70 camera. The sound was recorded on a 70 mm six-track using a Westrex recording system. The sets used for the film were based on the storyboards of sketch artist Maurice Zuberano, who accompanied Wise to Austria to scout filming locations in November 1963. Wise met with the artist over ten weeks and explained his objective for each scene\u2014the feeling he wanted to convey and the visual images he wanted to use. When Zuberano was finished, he provided Wise with a complete set of storyboards that illustrated each scene and set\u2014storyboards the director used as guidance during filming. Zuberano's storyboards and location photos were also used by art director Boris Leven to design and construct all of the original interior sets at Fox studios, as well as some external sets in Salzburg. The von Trapp villa, for example, was actually filmed in several locations: the front and back fa\u00e7ades of the villa were filmed at Frohnburg Palace, the lakeside terrace and gardens was a set constructed on a property adjacent to Schloss Leopoldskron called Bertelsmann, and the interior was a constructed set at Fox Studios. The gazebo scenes for \"Something Good\" and \"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\" were filmed on a larger reconstructed set at Fox studios, while some shots of the original gazebo were filmed on the grounds at Schloss Leopoldskron in Salzburg. Most of the soundtrack to The Sound of Music was written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and arranged and conducted by Irwin Kostal, who also adapted the instrumental underscore passages. Both the lyrics and music for two new songs were written by Rodgers, as Hammerstein died in 1960. The soundtrack album was released by RCA Victor in 1965 and is one of the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 20 million copies worldwide. The album reached the number one position on the Billboard 200 that year in the United States. It remained in the top ten for 109 weeks, from May 1, 1965, to July 16, 1967, and remained on the Billboard 200 chart for 238 weeks. The album was the best-selling album in the United Kingdom in 1965, 1966, and 1968 and the second best-selling of the entire decade, spending a total of 70 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It also stayed 73 weeks on the Norwegian charts, becoming the seventh best-charting album of all time in that country. In 2015, Billboard named the album the second greatest album of all time. The album has been reissued several times, including anniversary editions with additional tracks in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Wise hired Mike Kaplan to direct the publicity campaign for the film. After reading the script, Kaplan decided on the ad line \"The Happiest Sound in All the World\", which would appear on promotional material and artwork. Kaplan also brought in outside agencies to work with the studio's advertising department to develop the promotional artwork, eventually selecting a painting by Howard Terpning of Andrews on an alpine meadow with her carpetbag and guitar case in hand with the children and Plummer in the background. In February 1964, Kaplan began placing ads in the trade papers Daily Variety, Weekly Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter to attract future exhibitor interest in the project. The studio intended the film to have an initial roadshow theatrical release in select large cities in theaters that could accommodate the 70-mm screenings and six-track stereophonic sound.

Kaplan identified forty key cities that would likely be included in the roadshow release and developed a promotional strategy targeting the major newspapers of those cities. During the Salzburg production phase, 20th Century-Fox organized press junkets for American journalists to interview Wise and his team and the cast members. \"No one is comfortable with an excess of hearts and flowers, but there is no valid reason for hiding honest emotion. This has always been a major element in the theatre, and it's my conviction that anyone who can't, on occasion, be sentimental about children, home or nature is sadly maladjusted.\" Richard Rodgers The film had its opening premiere on March 2, 1965, at the Rivoli Theater in New York City. Initial reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's \"romantic nonsense and sentiment\", the children's \"artificial roles\", and Robert Wise's \"cosy-cum-corny\" direction. Judith Crist, in a biting review in the New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as \"icky sticky\" and designed for \"the five to seven set and their mommies\". In her review for McCall's magazine, Pauline Kael called the film \"the sugar-coated lie people seem to want to eat\", and that audiences have \"turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs.\" Wise later recalled, \"The East Coast, intellectual papers and magazines destroyed us, but the local papers and the trades gave us great reviews\". Indeed, reviewers such as Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \"three hours of visual and vocal brilliance\", and Variety called it \"a warmly-pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast\". The \"wildly mixed film reviews\" reflected the critical response to the stage musical, according to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical. After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10, The Sound of Music opened in 131 theaters in the United States, including a limited number of roadshow events. After four weeks, the film became the number one box office movie in the country and held that position for thirty out of the next forty-three weeks in 1965. The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years. A few months after its United States release, The Sound of Music opened in 261 theaters in other countries, the first American movie to be completely dubbed in a foreign language, both dialogue, and music. The German, French, Italian, and Spanish versions were completely dubbed, the Japanese version had Japanese dialogue with English songs, and other versions were released with foreign subtitles. The film was a popular success in every country it opened, except the two countries where the story originated, Austria and Germany. In these two countries, the film had to compete with the much-loved Die Trapp-Familie (1956), which provided the original inspiration for the Broadway musical, and its sequel Die Trapp-Familie in Amerika (1958); both films are still widely popular in German-speaking Europe and considered the authoritative von Trapp story. Austrians took exception to the liberties taken by the filmmakers with regard to the costumes, which did not reflect the traditional style and the replacement of traditional Austrian folk songs with Broadway show tunes. The film's Nazi theme was especially unpopular in Germany, where the Munich branch manager for 20th Century-Fox approved the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act of the film following the wedding sequence\u2014the scenes showing Salzburg following the Anschluss. Robert Wise and the studio intervened, the original film was restored, and the branch manager was fired. The Sound of Music holds an 84% \"Certified Fresh\" score on Rotten Tomatoes based on seventy-four reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's consensus states: \"Unapologetically sweet and maybe even a little corny, The Sound of Music will win over all but the most cynical filmgoers with its classic songs and irresistible warmth.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on eleven critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The Sound of Music is one of the most commercially successful films of all time. Four weeks after its theatrical release, it became the number one box office movie in the United States, from revenue generated by twenty-five theaters, each screening only ten roadshow performances per week. It held the number one position for thirty of the next forty-three weeks, and ended up the highest-grossing film of 1965. One contributing factor in the film's early commercial success was the repeat business of many filmgoers. In some cities in the United States, the number of tickets sold exceeded the total population.

Worldwide, The Sound of Music broke previous box-office records in twenty-nine countries, including the United Kingdom, where it played for a record-breaking three years at the Dominion Theatre in London and earned \u00a34 million in rentals and grossed \u00a36 million\u2014more than twice as much as any other film had taken in. It was also a major success in the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, where it played for as long as two years at some theaters. It was not a universal success, however, with the film only enjoying modest success in France and it was a flop in Germany. It also initially performed poorly in Italy, but a re-release after the Oscars brought better results. It was number one at the US box office for a further 11 weeks in 1966, for a total of 41 weeks at number one. By November 1966, The Sound of Music had become the highest-grossing film of all time, with over $67.5 million in worldwide rentals ($125 million in gross receipts), surpassing Gone with the Wind, which held that distinction for twenty-four years. It was still in the top ten at the US box office in its 100th week of release. The Sound of Music completed its initial four-and-a-half year theatrical release run in the United States on Labor Day 1969, the longest initial run for a film in the US, having earned $68,313,000 in rentals in the United States and Canada. It played for 142 weeks at the Eglinton Theatre in Toronto. It was the first film to gross over $100 million. By December 1970, it had earned $121.5 million in worldwide rentals, which was over four times higher than the film's estimated break-even point of $29.5 million in rentals. The film was re-released in 1973, and increased its North American rentals to $78.4 million. By the end of the 1970s, it was ranked seventh in all-time North American rentals, having earned $79 million. The film's re-release in 1990 increased the total North American admissions to 142,415,400\u2014the third-highest number of tickets sold behind Gone with the Wind and Star Wars\u2014and about 283.3 million admissions worldwide. The Sound of Music eventually earned a total domestic gross of $163,214,076 and a total worldwide gross of $286,214,076. Adjusted for inflation, the film earned about $2.366 billion at 2014 prices\u2014placing it among the top ten highest-grossing films of all time. The Sound of Music has been included in numerous top film lists from the American Film Institute. The first American television transmission of The Sound of Music was on February 29, 1976, on ABC, which paid $15 million (equivalent to $77,140,351 in 2022) for a one-time only broadcast that became one of the top 20 rated films shown on television to that point with a Nielsen rating of 33.6 and an audience share of 49%. The movie was not shown again until NBC acquired the broadcast rights in June 1977 for $21.5 million for 20 showings over 22 years and telecast the film on February 11, 1979. NBC continued to air the film annually for twenty years. During most of its run on NBC, the film was heavily edited to fit a three-hour time slot\u2014approximately 140 minutes without commercials, which inevitably cut 30 minutes out of the original film. The film aired in its uncut form (minus the entr'acte) on April 9, 1995, on NBC. Julie Andrews hosted the four-hour telecast which presented the musical numbers in a letterboxed format. As the film's home video availability cut into its television ratings, NBC let their contract lapse in 2001. That year, the film was broadcast one time on the Fox network, in its heavily edited 140-minute version. Since 2002, the film has aired on ABC on a Sunday night prior to Christmas and has been broadcast on its sister cable network, Freeform, periodically around Easter and other holidays. Most of its more recent runs have been the full version in a four-hour time slot, complete with the entr'acte. ABC first broadcast a high-definition version on December 28, 2008. On December 22, 2013, the annual broadcast had its highest ratings since 2007; the increase in ratings were credited to NBC's broadcast of The Sound of Music Live!\u2014a live television adaptation of the original musical which aired earlier that month. In the United Kingdom, the film rights were acquired by the BBC, who paid a corporation record $4.1 million, and it was first aired on BBC One on 25 December 1978 and, as of December 2016, fifteen times since, mostly around Christmas time.

The first DVD version was released on August 29, 2000, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the film's release. The film is often included in box sets with other Rodgers & Hammerstein film adaptations. A 40th anniversary DVD, with \"making of\" documentaries and special features, was released on November 15, 2005. The film made its debut issue on Blu-ray Disc on November 2, 2010, for its 45th anniversary. For the Blu-ray release, the original 70 mm negatives were rescanned at 8K resolution, then restored and remastered at 4K resolution for the transfer to Blu-ray, giving the most detailed copy of the film seen thus far. On March 10, 2015, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released The Sound of Music 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition\u2014a five-disc set featuring thirteen hours of bonus features, including a new documentary, The Sound of a City: Julie Andrews Returns to Salzburg. A March 2015 episode of ABC's 20/20 entitled The Untold Story of the Sound of Music featured a preview of the documentary and interviews by Diane Sawyer. In part to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, the film was made available on the Disney+ streaming service upon its debut on November 12, 2019. The Sound of Music film adaptation, like the stage musical, presents a history of the von Trapp family (a.k.a. the Trapp Family) that is not completely accurate. The musical was based on the West German film The Trapp Family (1956) rather than Maria von Trapp's 1949 memoirs, as director Vincent J. Donehue had seen the film and decided that it would make a good vehicle for Mary Martin. The musical followed the film's plot so closely that the New York Times review of the West German film noticed that it \"strongly suggests 'The Sound of Music,' often scene by scene.\" The West German screenwriters made several significant changes to the family's story that were kept in the musical. Maria had been hired to teach just one child, but the 1956 film made her governess to all seven children. The 1965 film adaptation was influenced by other musicals of its era, such as Mary Poppins, the Rodgers and Hammerstein television production of Cinderella, and the stage production of Lerner and Loewe's Camelot (coincidentally all starring Julie Andrews). Screenwriter Ernest Lehman was inspired by the opening of West Side Story and saw the musical as \"a fairy tale that's almost real\". The film incorporated many \"fairy tale\" tropes which included the idyllic imagery (placed in the hills of Salzburg), the European villas, and the cross-class Cinderella-like romance between Maria and Captain Von Trapp. As Maria walks down the aisle to be married, the pageantry is explicitly both Guinevere and Cinderella. In keeping with this tone the filmmakers used artistic license to convey the essence and meaning of their story. Georg Ludwig von Trapp was indeed an anti-Nazi opposed to the Anschluss, and lived with his family in a villa in a district of Salzburg called Aigen. Their lifestyle depicted in the film, however, greatly exaggerated their standard of living. The actual family villa, located at Traunstra\u00dfe 34, Aigen 5026, was large and comfortable but not nearly as grand as the mansion depicted in the film. The house was also not their ancestral home, as depicted in the film. The family had previously lived in homes in Zell Am See and Klosterneuburg after being forced to abandon their actual ancestral home in Pola following World War I. Georg moved the family to the Salzburg villa shortly after the death of his first wife, Agathe Whitehead, in 1922. Georg is referred to as \"Captain\" in the film, but he held a noble title of \"Ritter\" (hereditary knight), which had higher social status than a naval officer. Although Austrian nobility was legally abolished in 1919 and the nobiliary particle von was proscribed, both continued to be widely used unofficially as a matter of social courtesy. Georg was offered a position in the German Kriegsmarine; Nazi Germany was looking to expand its fleet of U-boats, and Corvette Captain von Trapp was the most successful Austro-Hungarian submarine commander of World War I, having sunk 11 Allied merchant ships totaling 47,653 GRT and two Allied warships displacing a total of 12,641 tons. With his family in desperate financial straits, he seriously considered the offer before deciding he could not serve a Nazi regime. In the film, Georg is depicted initially as a humorless, emotionally distant father. In reality, third child Maria Franziska von Trapp (\n\nquestion: What does the movie showcase about Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Salzburg.

She has a different recollection of her stepmother, Maria Augusta Kutschera, whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage. In a 2003 interview, Maria remembered, \" had a terrible temper... and from one moment to the next, you didn't know what hit her. We were not used to this. But we took it like a thunderstorm that would pass, because the next minute she could be very nice.\" Maria Kutschera had indeed been a novice at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and had been hired by the von Trapp family. However, she was hired only to be a tutor to young Maria Franziska, who had come down with scarlet fever and needed her lessons at home, not to be a governess for all of the children. Maria and Georg married for practical reasons, rather than love and affection for each other. Georg needed a mother for his children, and Maria needed the security of a husband and family once she decided to leave the abbey. \"I really and truly was not in love,\" Maria wrote in her memoir, \"I liked him but didn't love him. However, I loved the children, so in a way I really married the children. I learned to love him more than I have ever loved before or after.\" They were married in 1927, not in 1938 as depicted in the film, and the couple had been married for over a decade by the time of the Anschluss and had two of their three children together by that time. Maria and Georg enjoyed a happy marriage. The von Trapp family lost most of its wealth during the worldwide depression of the early 1930s, when the Austrian national bank folded. In order to survive, the family dismissed the servants and began taking in boarders. They also started singing onstage to earn money, a fact that caused the proud Georg much embarrassment. In the film, the von Trapp family hike over the Alps from Austria to Switzerland to escape the Nazis, which would not have been possible; Salzburg is over two hundred miles from Switzerland. The von Trapp villa, however, was only a few kilometers from the Austria\u2013Germany border, and the final scene shows the family hiking on the Obersalzberg near the German town of Berchtesgaden, within sight of Adolf Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus Eagle's Nest retreat. In reality, the family simply walked to the local train station and boarded a train to Italy. The Trapps were entitled to Italian citizenship since Georg had been born in Zadar, Dalmatia, Austria-Hungary, which had been annexed by Italy after World War I. They were able to emigrate to the United States via the United Kingdom on their Italian passports. The fictional character Max Detweiler, who acted as the scheming family music director in the film, is based on the von Trapps' family priest, the Reverend Franz Wasner, who was their musical director for over twenty years and, unlike Max, accompanied them when they left Austria. The character of Friedrich, the second oldest child in the film version, was based on Rupert, the oldest of the real von Trapp children. Liesl, the oldest child in the film, was based on Agathe von Trapp, the second oldest in the real family. The names and ages of the children were changed, in part because the third child, who would be portrayed as \"Louisa\", was also named Maria, and producers thought that it would be confusing to have two characters called Maria in the film. The von Trapp family had no control over how they were depicted in the film and stage musical, having given up the rights to their story to a German producer in the 1950s who then sold the rights to American producers. Robert Wise met with Maria von Trapp and made it clear, according to a memo to Richard Zanuck, that he was not making a \"documentary or realistic movie\" about her family, and that he would make the film with \"complete dramatic freedom\" in order to produce a \"fine and moving film\", one they could all be proud of. Although The Sound of Music is set in Salzburg, it was largely ignored in Austria upon release. The film adaptation was a blockbuster worldwide, but it ran for only three days in Salzburg movie theaters, with locals showing \"disdain\" for a film that \"wasn't authentic.\" In 1966, American Express created the first Sound of Music guided tour in Salzburg. Since 1972, Panorama Tours has been the leading Sound of Music bus tour company in the city, taking approximately 50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding region. Although the Salzburg tourism industry took advantage of the attention from foreign tourists, residents of the city were apathetic\n\nquestion: What does the movie showcase about Salzburg?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1124}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Filming Locations of \"The Sound of Music\" in Austria and California\n\nevidence:  about \"everything that is dubious about tourism.\" The guides on the bus tour \"seem to have little idea of what really happened on the set.\" Even the ticket agent for the Sound of Music Dinner Show tried to dissuade Austrians from attending a performance that was intended for American tourists, saying that it \"does not have anything to do with the real Austria.\" By 2007, The Sound of Music was drawing 300,000 visitors a year to Salzburg, more than the city's self-conception as the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. A German translation of the musical was performed on the national stage for the first time in 2005 at the Vienna Volksoper, receiving negative reviews from Austrian critics, who called it \"boring\" and referred to \"Edelweiss\" as \"an insult to Austrian musical creation.\" The musical finally premiered in Salzburg in 2011 at the Salzburger Landestheater, but Maria was played in the Salzburg premiere by a Dutch actress who \"grew up with the songs.\" However, most performances in Vienna and Salzburg were sold out, and the musical is now in both companies' repertoire. A Sing-along Sound of Music revival screening was first shown at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival in 1999, leading to a successful run at the Prince Charles Cinema which is ongoing as of 2018. During the screenings, audience members are often dressed as nuns and von Trapp children and are encouraged to sing along to lyrics superimposed on the screen. In July 2000, Sing-along Sound of Music shows opened in Boston, Massachusetts, and Austin, Texas. Some audience members dressed up as cast members and interacted with the action shown on the screen. The film began a successful run at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City in September 2000, with the opening attended by cast members Charmian Carr (Liesl), Daniel Truhitte (Rolfe), and Kym Karath (Gretl). Sing-along Sound of Music screenings have since become an international phenomenon. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The Academy Film Archive preserved The Sound of Music in 2003.
