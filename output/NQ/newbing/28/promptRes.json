Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"Interpreting the Empowering Message of Rihanna's 'Diamonds'\"\n\nevidence: I think many are wrong when interpreting this song as just a drug related song. I see this song as totally different meaning. I believe it is about universal energy bringing two people together. One person is infatuated with another...feeling instant attraction but the other person is lifeless, depressed and does not know the other one is there yet. There is a part in her video where the horse comes to another horse laying lifeless on the ground and the other once presence and energy brings the other horse to life again. Beautiful scene! So it is not just about drugs and alcohol; it is more about two people coming together and becoming inseparable with the help of \"universe\". And going beyond this life even after it ends here. \"We are beautiful like diamonds in the sky\". Sia wrote the song and her songs always have positive messages of resurrection and \"second chances\". This is more of a love song of one helping the other come to life and happiness together. Only Rihanna Navy understand that diamonds refer to Rihanna with her \"Gran Gran Dolly \"who passed away this year, together they'll never die and be beautifull like diamonds in the sky! So stop thinking she is only speaking about smoking! This song is about her relationship with Chris Brown. This is not the first time she has referred to herself and Brown as \"diamonds\" as she did so in the Calvin Harris song We Found Love when she referred to them as \"yellow diamonds in the light\", another song obviously about Brown. Rihanna is telling Chris to shine bright in his fame. Her emotions are as deep as the sea, and after all the pain she has through with him she still found her light and chooses to be happy by keeping a friendly relationship with Chris Brown despite all the strong opinions the media voices about her decision to remain in contact with him. Her referring to him as a \"vision of ecstasy\" is a play on the words as it is no secret she and Brown partook in the recreational use of the drug together as was seen in her video for We Found Love. When he holds her she feels more alive and they both are shining like diamonds or stars in the sky. She knew right away that they would connect and that this connection would be deeper than any love she has ever felt. She wants them to just go on loving each other tonight and to be on the same page with that love, eye to eye, in the way they feel and make love with each other. Moonshine and Molly are drugs. Moonshine is a type of very strong liquor that is homemade in the South and Molly is a street-name for the drug ecstasy. They are doing these drugs together and dancing, arms up with palms in the sky, to the universe. Under the influence of these drugs they feel as though they are stronger and better than when on their own, without drugs or each other so she wants them to continue to do what it takes to shine like a star, or, in Rihanna's and Chris' case, a superstar on the planet. Superstars on the planet eventually die and are forgotten, they will never be as immortal as a shooting star in the sky, as Rihanna hopes. That's just my thoughts. This song is not about drugs and alcohol. It is about self worth and empowerment. I think it is meant to encourage people to embrace their imperfections,and that true value is not in material objects, but in the realization of inner happiness and confidence. Sia wrote this song to remind people that they are beautiful. Sure, there are references to drugs and alcohol, but those are things that hurt us and have little worth. They do not help us find true happiness. If anything, they lead us astray from the path to it. \"Shine bright\" is telling us to show our true colors. \"Find light in the beautiful sea I choose to be happy\" shares that objects are worthless compared to joy. I was gobsmacked yesterday rereading the nursey rhyme, twinkle twinkle little star and the allusion thereto. I was with my grade six learner and was amazed at the connection. The part where she says she finds light in the beautiful sea scares me.I think this song has many hidden spiritual meanings Well first of this song has little to do with Rhianna she is only voice of the song - the text really has been done by Sia (and producers). Sia has a lot of experience with drugs like extacy LSD and alcohol. \"Lucy in the sky with diamonds\" - Shine bright like a diamond... Molly etc... Backward message was so 80' but really think about this buddy - brain does NOT \"understand\" any backward messsages - it does not go after every 10 second and then put things and start to do time reversing - that is absurd. Thing is, you find what you seek when you listen songs backward. Yes I know there are songs where at the time musicans did put messages backward for purpose... mostly at the 80\n\nquestion: Who sings the song 'Diamonds'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1105}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

How little can you know about your own religion sigh... didnt you already know that there was another person related into same star and he was Jesus Christ. \"19 We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.\" - 2 peter 1:19. If you look at the history of Christianity you will soon notice that really, Christian religion has had times it has mostly be good for people and society and times it has been bad - perhaps this is reason why Jesus told things like he is not coming with peace rather than sword etc etc. Christian religion has been Christ and anti-Christ at the same time. Christ is the morning star and Lucifer. Ok so you guys probably know this already but if you are like me and very confused on whos song is whos and went here to find out but it only made you more confused then well, im here to answer that. Here, i copy and pasted this from wiki and kinda editied it so i wont get copywrited. Diamond is a song recorded by Rihanna for her seventh studio album Unapologetic. It was written by Sia with her producers, Benny Blanco and StarGate. idk if thats confusing or not but it basically means rihanna sang the song and sia wrote it with her producers or so i assume. (i do not know if this is correct or not so dont hate on me,also, you can correct me if you want but I really wont care because im just trying to help sooo :/ ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamonds_(Rihanna_song) Please, you just have to know that this song Diamond is deep and spiritual so let's think about it from the Bible perspective. Lucifer is referred to as light, and Diamond can also represent something that is shining because the Bible made us understand that Lucifer is the morning star. When you look closely at the video, she looks scared and running away from the light coming after her and at some point, she stopped and looking up in the sky. I also noticed towards the end of the video, she has tears in her eyes and also she was seen in the sea. This song Diamond has deep meaning and is only the spiritually-minded individuals who can decode the meaning of this song. yo sorry, me i again.. the beauty is, and irony is lol. you are of course all correct. in my opinion. see..its about all of these things... uh do i think tons of songs have an \"illuminati\" agenda..nope. do some? well, lets just call it occult or spiritualism.. yes. without question. more sinister than your standard jeeezuz anything...certainly not. i would say yes, it probably is kabbalah focused.. i dont know Sia, or much about her, none of my biz really..im just here to double check the lyrics cuz love it, and was for ME, about Lucifer, satan, that guy..and i LOVE IT AND HAIL SATAN! he is the light and yes, great tune. slappin mix btw, i hardly ever have this impression on pop songs. cuz im not insane like youtube freasks blabla dont core if the illumanit is hidingjkf in my dollar bills or some crap. cuz had NOTHING TO DO with ME or Im willing bet you.. to the person that above, who is just aching to prove to you that this song has a satanic agenda.. YES ok, but guess what peaches..ANY SONG can, if you want it to. that the beauty im talking about folks... so, sure u convinced me..in fact, i liked the song, AND you overwhelming proved to me it, you said look it up! so i did. and ya know what? i rather liked what i saw! thank you! you have converted me from an evangelical dip s hit to using my own brain today. feels good. also my phone wont stop ringing with recruits.. we burned down 763 churches just for you and started a satanic ufo suicide cult. thanks im gonna name the mothership in your honor.. this one...umm yeah.. are you stupid???? sorry is it about chris brown? sure? satan? sure cuz satan is everything around us, he is the light. do you have light in your heart? i do. why not eat that fruit? well mostly not this though lol nice try, but hey thats free thinking so youre already on a left path You are all wrong, The song represents something she has seen in a vision. It is the God of living waters, He has diamonds of light that radiate throughout his body. He is revealing himself to her, He has looked through the spect\n\nquestion: Who sings the song 'Diamonds'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Rihanna", "usage": 1100}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He is the creator and the one who planted the seed of life. He is the one that revealith a new King, bla bla trust me nobody cares but im actually glad you see something for what you want cool... hey shit heads. This song in MY opinion, is CLEARLY SATANIC! AND THATS WHY I LOVE IT!!! HAIL SATAN!!!! you honestly think those baby raping pieces of trash could ever knock a banger like this?? u dumb. in fact, prob so dumb that you cant use your own mind gifted to you. and you must follow what other d ildos tell you to....Satan represents the individual spirit, the urge to fend for the self, serve the self, and rely on the self. As Satan would not be subjugated to another, so it should be with the Satanist. This individualism extends to personal responsibility; that all choices are you own, even only how you react to random events. Allowing another to take credit for your successes or blame for your failures shows a weakness in personal character, and sets you up to be manipulated by those around you. It is delusional to wait for someone, man or god, to save you. Your salvation should be of your own making. While it is these characteristics that Satan is best known for, his creative ability is often ignored. Satan encourages the act of creation and the appreciation of the creative act. In mythology, Satan is attributed with patronage of the arts, especially as an expression of personal ego. In modern times, some have gone as far as suggesting Satan is at the root of our movies, music, and literature. Satanists are well served to seek their own means of creative expression. in closing, read those lyrics. sure maybe sia didnt write it as a love song to satan, but for me..she did. case in point. #2 Palms rise to the universe bitch, u think this song is about jesus? i feel sorry for you. or you are maybe idk kinda retarded i guess..think what you want though. cuz thats satanic freethinking already lemme ask you this? whats so bad satan> what did he ever do to you?? did he or man who guilt trip you about some original sin? take you money and did satan he make you ashamed of you body??nope never! what caring god wouldnt want you to pleasure yourself? either way, have nice. day. also, if it makes feel good and doesnt hurt anybody or creatures, why not? if you want to that is. also, fornicate and sodomize everything possible. better yes, fuck a priest, right up his faggot assss. whoopee, then whisper in his ear, thats he the bad guy..they fucked up this earth. killing millions. source: go outside btw this person MOSTLY nailed it as well Shine bright like a diamond. Everyone please do my a favor and look up what the Devil has wrote in his bible.. WRONG NOT THE \"DEVIL\" IT AIWASS. WHO AMAZINGLY DICTATED IT USING AL'S WIFE AS A MEDIUM. FOR THOSE THAT DONT KNOW,ALEISTER CROWLEY AKA 666 WAS A KICK ASS GUY,AND LOVED CLIMBING K2 AND OTHER MOUNTAINS, AND PUTTING CUM IN BUMS RUNNING CULTS, EATING SOME TURDS AND INSPIRING HEAVY METAL. THANKS AL! \"The law of Thelema.\" His law is to \"Do what thou wilt SHALL BE THE WHOLE OF THE LAW\". This means to do what you want, however you want and whenever you want. The meaning of this song is your a star and that everyone is and that you should shine bright. In the book of the law it says \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" All the songs she sings is glorification of self. A satanism agenda that's why this song is beautiful As we moonshine and molly Feel the warmth, we\u2019ll never die We\u2019re like diamonds in the sky I think to be in that relationship to between those love to the song but it\u2019s so much fun I got a relationship with a guy on my chat with strangers, I asked him out to go on a date. Then we can be boyfriend and girlfriend. It\u2019s so sweet. I love that song to make this deal to me. But I\u2019ve always had my boyfriend his name is. Lucas he\u2019s on my chatting on my website he\u2019s so cute and sweet. I love him he\u2019s a sweet guy. This song is clearly spiritual. People shouldn\u2019t take everything in a song as literal like comments that it is about chris brown.

Rihanna is spiritual by nature and you will be surprised how many big hitters on the scene are spiritual. Spirituality gives you a wider view of reality and this awareness allows them to become so successful. Please people stop seeing music as something that they dislike or have experienced in this material world. Devotion is handled in music as a deeper love than the mere fancy; when somebody sings about their devotion, you know it got serious. Crystal Meth! Look at the pic.. watch the videoclip!!! For me i think that the song is devilish because the meaning of ecstasy is drugs Ok people... Let me take a stab at this- I just lost the love of my life of 15yrs and this song is the very story of us... This of course is just my interpretation; it appears and begins by letting us know their relationship is volatile and all the furnishings are broken and shes running from her lover in the car but when she sees the aurora she realizes hes the best thing for her and how much he meant to her when the furnishings begin piecing back together and the same when it seems hes carrying her through the desert- but in her mistake or BOTH their mistake rather that they indeed seperate its almost too late- as we come to the horse scene where Im guessing its HER that happens upon him laying down almost all but spent and in his deepest depth of depression he needs her as much as she needs him that she finds him and asks his forgiveness-hence the nedging after the horse gets up and caresses her as in love and forgiveness just glad shes back in his life and they run along finally together stronger than ever.... Where the hands seperate at the end might suggest that sometimes thats what it takes for us to realize exactly how much we need the other in our life. Although I have not been as lucky its what goes through my mind everytime I hear the song. Keep in mind people rhianna DID NOT write the song so I dont see anywhere it could suggest brown. For the ultimate true meaning wed have to ask the songwriter. Until someone does.... Its just interpretation. People gon talk whether you doing bad or good.. I guess Riri is right but this song doesn't include satan yeah it can be about Chris but we must stop Judging the Queen an let God be.

Backward message was so 80' but really think about this buddy - brain does NOT \"understand\" any backward messsages - it does not go after every 10 second and then put things and start to do time reversing - that is absurd. Thing is, you find what you seek when you listen songs backward. Yes I know there are songs where at the time musicans did put messages backward for purpose... mostly at the 80\n\nquestion: What is the song 'Diamonds' about?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "interstellar love and the power of the universe to bring two people together", "usage": 1118}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If you look at the history of Christianity you will soon notice that really, Christian religion has had times it has mostly be good for people and society and times it has been bad - perhaps this is reason why Jesus told things like he is not coming with peace rather than sword etc etc. Christian religion has been Christ and anti-Christ at the same time. Christ is the morning star and Lucifer. Ok so you guys probably know this already but if you are like me and very confused on whos song is whos and went here to find out but it only made you more confused then well, im here to answer that. Here, i copy and pasted this from wiki and kinda editied it so i wont get copywrited. Diamond is a song recorded by Rihanna for her seventh studio album Unapologetic. It was written by Sia with her producers, Benny Blanco and StarGate. idk if thats confusing or not but it basically means rihanna sang the song and sia wrote it with her producers or so i assume. (i do not know if this is correct or not so dont hate on me,also, you can correct me if you want but I really wont care because im just trying to help sooo :/ ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamonds_(Rihanna_song) Please, you just have to know that this song Diamond is deep and spiritual so let's think about it from the Bible perspective. Lucifer is referred to as light, and Diamond can also represent something that is shining because the Bible made us understand that Lucifer is the morning star. When you look closely at the video, she looks scared and running away from the light coming after her and at some point, she stopped and looking up in the sky. I also noticed towards the end of the video, she has tears in her eyes and also she was seen in the sea. This song Diamond has deep meaning and is only the spiritually-minded individuals who can decode the meaning of this song. yo sorry, me i again.. the beauty is, and irony is lol. you are of course all correct. in my opinion. see..its about all of these things... uh do i think tons of songs have an \"illuminati\" agenda..nope. do some? well, lets just call it occult or spiritualism.. yes. without question. more sinister than your standard jeeezuz anything...certainly not. i would say yes, it probably is kabbalah focused.. i dont know Sia, or much about her, none of my biz really..im just here to double check the lyrics cuz love it, and was for ME, about Lucifer, satan, that guy..and i LOVE IT AND HAIL SATAN! he is the light and yes, great tune. slappin mix btw, i hardly ever have this impression on pop songs. cuz im not insane like youtube freasks blabla dont core if the illumanit is hidingjkf in my dollar bills or some crap. cuz had NOTHING TO DO with ME or Im willing bet you.. to the person that above, who is just aching to prove to you that this song has a satanic agenda.. YES ok, but guess what peaches..ANY SONG can, if you want it to. that the beauty im talking about folks... so, sure u convinced me..in fact, i liked the song, AND you overwhelming proved to me it, you said look it up! so i did. and ya know what? i rather liked what i saw! thank you! you have converted me from an evangelical dip s hit to using my own brain today. feels good. also my phone wont stop ringing with recruits.. we burned down 763 churches just for you and started a satanic ufo suicide cult. thanks im gonna name the mothership in your honor.. this one...umm yeah.. are you stupid???? sorry is it about chris brown? sure? satan? sure cuz satan is everything around us, he is the light. do you have light in your heart? i do. why not eat that fruit? well mostly not this though lol nice try, but hey thats free thinking so youre already on a left path You are all wrong, The song represents something she has seen in a vision.

As Satan would not be subjugated to another, so it should be with the Satanist. This individualism extends to personal responsibility; that all choices are you own, even only how you react to random events. Allowing another to take credit for your successes or blame for your failures shows a weakness in personal character, and sets you up to be manipulated by those around you. It is delusional to wait for someone, man or god, to save you. Your salvation should be of your own making. While it is these characteristics that Satan is best known for, his creative ability is often ignored. Satan encourages the act of creation and the appreciation of the creative act. In mythology, Satan is attributed with patronage of the arts, especially as an expression of personal ego. In modern times, some have gone as far as suggesting Satan is at the root of our movies, music, and literature. Satanists are well served to seek their own means of creative expression. in closing, read those lyrics. sure maybe sia didnt write it as a love song to satan, but for me..she did. case in point. #2 Palms rise to the universe bitch, u think this song is about jesus? i feel sorry for you. or you are maybe idk kinda retarded i guess..think what you want though. cuz thats satanic freethinking already lemme ask you this? whats so bad satan> what did he ever do to you?? did he or man who guilt trip you about some original sin? take you money and did satan he make you ashamed of you body??nope never! what caring god wouldnt want you to pleasure yourself? either way, have nice. day. also, if it makes feel good and doesnt hurt anybody or creatures, why not? if you want to that is. also, fornicate and sodomize everything possible. better yes, fuck a priest, right up his faggot assss. whoopee, then whisper in his ear, thats he the bad guy..they fucked up this earth. killing millions. source: go outside btw this person MOSTLY nailed it as well Shine bright like a diamond.

Let me take a stab at this- I just lost the love of my life of 15yrs and this song is the very story of us... This of course is just my interpretation; it appears and begins by letting us know their relationship is volatile and all the furnishings are broken and shes running from her lover in the car but when she sees the aurora she realizes hes the best thing for her and how much he meant to her when the furnishings begin piecing back together and the same when it seems hes carrying her through the desert- but in her mistake or BOTH their mistake rather that they indeed seperate its almost too late- as we come to the horse scene where Im guessing its HER that happens upon him laying down almost all but spent and in his deepest depth of depression he needs her as much as she needs him that she finds him and asks his forgiveness-hence the nedging after the horse gets up and caresses her as in love and forgiveness just glad shes back in his life and they run along finally together stronger than ever....

Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"Interpreting the Empowering Message of Rihanna's 'Diamonds'\"\n\nevidence: I think many are wrong when interpreting this song as just a drug related song. I see this song as totally different meaning. I believe it is about universal energy bringing two people together. One person is infatuated with another...feeling instant attraction but the other person is lifeless, depressed and does not know the other one is there yet. There is a part in her video where the horse comes to another horse laying lifeless on the ground and the other once presence and energy brings the other horse to life again. Beautiful scene! So it is not just about drugs and alcohol; it is more about two people coming together and becoming inseparable with the help of \"universe\". And going beyond this life even after it ends here. \"We are beautiful like diamonds in the sky\". Sia wrote the song and her songs always have positive messages of resurrection and \"second chances\". This is more of a love song of one helping the other come to life and happiness together. Only Rihanna Navy understand that diamonds refer to Rihanna with her \"Gran Gran Dolly \"who passed away this year, together they'll never die and be beautifull like diamonds in the sky! So stop thinking she is only speaking about smoking! This song is about her relationship with Chris Brown. This is not the first time she has referred to herself and Brown as \"diamonds\" as she did so in the Calvin Harris song We Found Love when she referred to them as \"yellow diamonds in the light\", another song obviously about Brown. Rihanna is telling Chris to shine bright in his fame. Her emotions are as deep as the sea, and after all the pain she has through with him she still found her light and chooses to be happy by keeping a friendly relationship with Chris Brown despite all the strong opinions the media voices about her decision to remain in contact with him. Her referring to him as a \"vision of ecstasy\" is a play on the words as it is no secret she and Brown partook in the recreational use of the drug together as was seen in her video for We Found Love. When he holds her she feels more alive and they both are shining like diamonds or stars in the sky. She knew right away that they would connect and that this connection would be deeper than any love she has ever felt. She wants them to just go on loving each other tonight and to be on the same page with that love, eye to eye, in the way they feel and make love with each other. Moonshine and Molly are drugs. Moonshine is a type of very strong liquor that is homemade in the South and Molly is a street-name for the drug ecstasy. They are doing these drugs together and dancing, arms up with palms in the sky, to the universe. Under the influence of these drugs they feel as though they are stronger and better than when on their own, without drugs or each other so she wants them to continue to do what it takes to shine like a star, or, in Rihanna's and Chris' case, a superstar on the planet. Superstars on the planet eventually die and are forgotten, they will never be as immortal as a shooting star in the sky, as Rihanna hopes. That's just my thoughts. This song is not about drugs and alcohol. It is about self worth and empowerment. I think it is meant to encourage people to embrace their imperfections,and that true value is not in material objects, but in the realization of inner happiness and confidence. Sia wrote this song to remind people that they are beautiful. Sure, there are references to drugs and alcohol, but those are things that hurt us and have little worth. They do not help us find true happiness. If anything, they lead us astray from the path to it. \"Shine bright\" is telling us to show our true colors. \"Find light in the beautiful sea I choose to be happy\" shares that objects are worthless compared to joy. I was gobsmacked yesterday rereading the nursey rhyme, twinkle twinkle little star and the allusion thereto. I was with my grade six learner and was amazed at the connection. The part where she says she finds light in the beautiful sea scares me.I think this song has many hidden spiritual meanings Well first of this song has little to do with Rhianna she is only voice of the song - the text really has been done by Sia (and producers).

There is a part in her video where the horse comes to another horse laying lifeless on the ground and the other once presence and energy brings the other horse to life again. Beautiful scene! So it is not just about drugs and alcohol; it is more about two people coming together and becoming inseparable with the help of \"universe\". And going beyond this life even after it ends here. \"We are beautiful like diamonds in the sky\". Sia wrote the song and her songs always have positive messages of resurrection and \"second chances\". This is more of a love song of one helping the other come to life and happiness together. Only Rihanna Navy understand that diamonds refer to Rihanna with her \"Gran Gran Dolly \"who passed away this year, together they'll never die and be beautifull like diamonds in the sky! So stop thinking she is only speaking about smoking! This song is about her relationship with Chris Brown. This is not the first time she has referred to herself and Brown as \"diamonds\" as she did so in the Calvin Harris song We Found Love when she referred to them as \"yellow diamonds in the light\", another song obviously about Brown. Rihanna is telling Chris to shine bright in his fame. Her emotions are as deep as the sea, and after all the pain she has through with him she still found her light and chooses to be happy by keeping a friendly relationship with Chris Brown despite all the strong opinions the media voices about her decision to remain in contact with him. Her referring to him as a \"vision of ecstasy\" is a play on the words as it is no secret she and Brown partook in the recreational use of the drug together as was seen in her video for We Found Love. When he holds her she feels more alive and they both are shining like diamonds or stars in the sky. She knew right away that they would connect and that this connection would be deeper than any love she has ever felt. She wants them to just go on loving each other tonight and to be on the same page with that love, eye to eye, in the way they feel and make love with each other. Moonshine and Molly are drugs. Moonshine is a type of very strong liquor that is homemade in the South and Molly is a street-name for the drug ecstasy. They are doing these drugs together and dancing, arms up with palms in the sky, to the universe. Under the influence of these drugs they feel as though they are stronger and better than when on their own, without drugs or each other so she wants them to continue to do what it takes to shine like a star, or, in Rihanna's and Chris' case, a superstar on the planet. Superstars on the planet eventually die and are forgotten, they will never be as immortal as a shooting star in the sky, as Rihanna hopes. That's just my thoughts. This song is not about drugs and alcohol. It is about self worth and empowerment. I think it is meant to encourage people to embrace their imperfections,and that true value is not in material objects, but in the realization of inner happiness and confidence. Sia wrote this song to remind people that they are beautiful. Sure, there are references to drugs and alcohol, but those are things that hurt us and have little worth. They do not help us find true happiness. If anything, they lead us astray from the path to it. \"Shine bright\" is telling us to show our true colors. \"Find light in the beautiful sea I choose to be happy\" shares that objects are worthless compared to joy. I was gobsmacked yesterday rereading the nursey rhyme, twinkle twinkle little star and the allusion thereto. I was with my grade six learner and was amazed at the connection. The part where she says she finds light in the beautiful sea scares me.I think this song has many hidden spiritual meanings Well first of this song has little to do with Rhianna she is only voice of the song - the text really has been done by Sia (and producers). Sia has a lot of experience with drugs like extacy LSD and alcohol. \"Lucy in the sky with diamonds\" - Shine bright like a diamond... Molly etc... Backward message was so 80' but really think about this buddy - brain does NOT \"understand\" any backward messsages - it does not go after every 10 second and then put things and start to do time reversing - that is absurd. Thing is, you find what you seek when you listen songs backward. Yes I know there are songs where at the time musicans did put messages backward for purpose... mostly at the 80\n\nquestion: What did Rihanna describe the song as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1104}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

How little can you know about your own religion sigh... didnt you already know that there was another person related into same star and he was Jesus Christ. \"19 We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.\" - 2 peter 1:19. If you look at the history of Christianity you will soon notice that really, Christian religion has had times it has mostly be good for people and society and times it has been bad - perhaps this is reason why Jesus told things like he is not coming with peace rather than sword etc etc. Christian religion has been Christ and anti-Christ at the same time. Christ is the morning star and Lucifer. Ok so you guys probably know this already but if you are like me and very confused on whos song is whos and went here to find out but it only made you more confused then well, im here to answer that. Here, i copy and pasted this from wiki and kinda editied it so i wont get copywrited. Diamond is a song recorded by Rihanna for her seventh studio album Unapologetic. It was written by Sia with her producers, Benny Blanco and StarGate. idk if thats confusing or not but it basically means rihanna sang the song and sia wrote it with her producers or so i assume. (i do not know if this is correct or not so dont hate on me,also, you can correct me if you want but I really wont care because im just trying to help sooo :/ ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamonds_(Rihanna_song) Please, you just have to know that this song Diamond is deep and spiritual so let's think about it from the Bible perspective. Lucifer is referred to as light, and Diamond can also represent something that is shining because the Bible made us understand that Lucifer is the morning star. When you look closely at the video, she looks scared and running away from the light coming after her and at some point, she stopped and looking up in the sky. I also noticed towards the end of the video, she has tears in her eyes and also she was seen in the sea. This song Diamond has deep meaning and is only the spiritually-minded individuals who can decode the meaning of this song. yo sorry, me i again.. the beauty is, and irony is lol. you are of course all correct. in my opinion. see..its about all of these things... uh do i think tons of songs have an \"illuminati\" agenda..nope. do some? well, lets just call it occult or spiritualism.. yes. without question. more sinister than your standard jeeezuz anything...certainly not. i would say yes, it probably is kabbalah focused.. i dont know Sia, or much about her, none of my biz really..im just here to double check the lyrics cuz love it, and was for ME, about Lucifer, satan, that guy..and i LOVE IT AND HAIL SATAN! he is the light and yes, great tune. slappin mix btw, i hardly ever have this impression on pop songs. cuz im not insane like youtube freasks blabla dont core if the illumanit is hidingjkf in my dollar bills or some crap. cuz had NOTHING TO DO with ME or Im willing bet you.. to the person that above, who is just aching to prove to you that this song has a satanic agenda.. YES ok, but guess what peaches..ANY SONG can, if you want it to. that the beauty im talking about folks... so, sure u convinced me..in fact, i liked the song, AND you overwhelming proved to me it, you said look it up! so i did. and ya know what? i rather liked what i saw! thank you! you have converted me from an evangelical dip s hit to using my own brain today. feels good. also my phone wont stop ringing with recruits.. we burned down 763 churches just for you and started a satanic ufo suicide cult. thanks im gonna name the mothership in your honor.. this one...umm yeah.. are you stupid???? sorry is it about chris brown? sure? satan? sure cuz satan is everything around us, he is the light. do you have light in your heart? i do. why not eat that fruit? well mostly not this though lol nice try, but hey thats free thinking so youre already on a left path You are all wrong, The song represents something she has seen in a vision. It is the God of living waters, He has diamonds of light that radiate throughout his body. He is revealing himself to her, He has looked through the spect\n\nquestion: What did Rihanna describe the song as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1099}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He is the creator and the one who planted the seed of life. He is the one that revealith a new King, bla bla trust me nobody cares but im actually glad you see something for what you want cool... hey shit heads. This song in MY opinion, is CLEARLY SATANIC! AND THATS WHY I LOVE IT!!! HAIL SATAN!!!! you honestly think those baby raping pieces of trash could ever knock a banger like this?? u dumb. in fact, prob so dumb that you cant use your own mind gifted to you. and you must follow what other d ildos tell you to....Satan represents the individual spirit, the urge to fend for the self, serve the self, and rely on the self. As Satan would not be subjugated to another, so it should be with the Satanist. This individualism extends to personal responsibility; that all choices are you own, even only how you react to random events. Allowing another to take credit for your successes or blame for your failures shows a weakness in personal character, and sets you up to be manipulated by those around you. It is delusional to wait for someone, man or god, to save you. Your salvation should be of your own making. While it is these characteristics that Satan is best known for, his creative ability is often ignored. Satan encourages the act of creation and the appreciation of the creative act. In mythology, Satan is attributed with patronage of the arts, especially as an expression of personal ego. In modern times, some have gone as far as suggesting Satan is at the root of our movies, music, and literature. Satanists are well served to seek their own means of creative expression. in closing, read those lyrics. sure maybe sia didnt write it as a love song to satan, but for me..she did. case in point. #2 Palms rise to the universe bitch, u think this song is about jesus? i feel sorry for you. or you are maybe idk kinda retarded i guess..think what you want though. cuz thats satanic freethinking already lemme ask you this? whats so bad satan> what did he ever do to you?? did he or man who guilt trip you about some original sin? take you money and did satan he make you ashamed of you body??nope never! what caring god wouldnt want you to pleasure yourself? either way, have nice. day. also, if it makes feel good and doesnt hurt anybody or creatures, why not? if you want to that is. also, fornicate and sodomize everything possible. better yes, fuck a priest, right up his faggot assss. whoopee, then whisper in his ear, thats he the bad guy..they fucked up this earth. killing millions. source: go outside btw this person MOSTLY nailed it as well Shine bright like a diamond. Everyone please do my a favor and look up what the Devil has wrote in his bible.. WRONG NOT THE \"DEVIL\" IT AIWASS. WHO AMAZINGLY DICTATED IT USING AL'S WIFE AS A MEDIUM. FOR THOSE THAT DONT KNOW,ALEISTER CROWLEY AKA 666 WAS A KICK ASS GUY,AND LOVED CLIMBING K2 AND OTHER MOUNTAINS, AND PUTTING CUM IN BUMS RUNNING CULTS, EATING SOME TURDS AND INSPIRING HEAVY METAL. THANKS AL! \"The law of Thelema.\" His law is to \"Do what thou wilt SHALL BE THE WHOLE OF THE LAW\". This means to do what you want, however you want and whenever you want. The meaning of this song is your a star and that everyone is and that you should shine bright. In the book of the law it says \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" All the songs she sings is glorification of self. A satanism agenda that's why this song is beautiful As we moonshine and molly Feel the warmth, we\u2019ll never die We\u2019re like diamonds in the sky I think to be in that relationship to between those love to the song but it\u2019s so much fun I got a relationship with a guy on my chat with strangers, I asked him out to go on a date. Then we can be boyfriend and girlfriend. It\u2019s so sweet. I love that song to make this deal to me. But I\u2019ve always had my boyfriend his name is. Lucas he\u2019s on my chatting on my website he\u2019s so cute and sweet. I love him he\u2019s a sweet guy. This song is clearly spiritual. People shouldn\u2019t take everything in a song as literal like comments that it is about chris brown.

Please people stop seeing music as something that they dislike or have experienced in this material world. Devotion is handled in music as a deeper love than the mere fancy; when somebody sings about their devotion, you know it got serious. Crystal Meth! Look at the pic.. watch the videoclip!!! For me i think that the song is devilish because the meaning of ecstasy is drugs Ok people... Let me take a stab at this- I just lost the love of my life of 15yrs and this song is the very story of us... This of course is just my interpretation; it appears and begins by letting us know their relationship is volatile and all the furnishings are broken and shes running from her lover in the car but when she sees the aurora she realizes hes the best thing for her and how much he meant to her when the furnishings begin piecing back together and the same when it seems hes carrying her through the desert- but in her mistake or BOTH their mistake rather that they indeed seperate its almost too late- as we come to the horse scene where Im guessing its HER that happens upon him laying down almost all but spent and in his deepest depth of depression he needs her as much as she needs him that she finds him and asks his forgiveness-hence the nedging after the horse gets up and caresses her as in love and forgiveness just glad shes back in his life and they run along finally together stronger than ever.... Where the hands seperate at the end might suggest that sometimes thats what it takes for us to realize exactly how much we need the other in our life. Although I have not been as lucky its what goes through my mind everytime I hear the song. Keep in mind people rhianna DID NOT write the song so I dont see anywhere it could suggest brown. For the ultimate true meaning wed have to ask the songwriter. Until someone does.... Its just interpretation. People gon talk whether you doing bad or good.. I guess Riri is right but this song doesn't include satan yeah it can be about Chris but we must stop Judging the Queen an let God be.

This of course is just my interpretation; it appears and begins by letting us know their relationship is volatile and all the furnishings are broken and shes running from her lover in the car but when she sees the aurora she realizes hes the best thing for her and how much he meant to her when the furnishings begin piecing back together and the same when it seems hes carrying her through the desert- but in her mistake or BOTH their mistake rather that they indeed seperate its almost too late- as we come to the horse scene where Im guessing its HER that happens upon him laying down almost all but spent and in his deepest depth of depression he needs her as much as she needs him that she finds him and asks his forgiveness-hence the nedging after the horse gets up and caresses her as in love and forgiveness just glad shes back in his life and they run along finally together stronger than ever.... Where the hands seperate at the end might suggest that sometimes thats what it takes for us to realize exactly how much we need the other in our life. Although I have not been as lucky its what goes through my mind everytime I hear the song. Keep in mind people rhianna DID NOT write the song so I dont see anywhere it could suggest brown. For the ultimate true meaning wed have to ask the songwriter. Until someone does.... Its just interpretation. People gon talk whether you doing bad or good.. I guess Riri is right but this song doesn't include satan yeah it can be about Chris but we must stop Judging the Queen an let God be.

I see this song as totally different meaning. I believe it is about universal energy bringing two people together. One person is infatuated with another...feeling instant attraction but the other person is lifeless, depressed and does not know the other one is there yet. There is a part in her video where the horse comes to another horse laying lifeless on the ground and the other once presence and energy brings the other horse to life again. Beautiful scene! So it is not just about drugs and alcohol; it is more about two people coming together and becoming inseparable with the help of \"universe\". And going beyond this life even after it ends here. \"We are beautiful like diamonds in the sky\". Sia wrote the song and her songs always have positive messages of resurrection and \"second chances\". This is more of a love song of one helping the other come to life and happiness together. Only Rihanna Navy understand that diamonds refer to Rihanna with her \"Gran Gran Dolly \"who passed away this year, together they'll never die and be beautifull like diamonds in the sky! So stop thinking she is only speaking about smoking! This song is about her relationship with Chris Brown. This is not the first time she has referred to herself and Brown as \"diamonds\" as she did so in the Calvin Harris song We Found Love when she referred to them as \"yellow diamonds in the light\", another song obviously about Brown. Rihanna is telling Chris to shine bright in his fame. Her emotions are as deep as the sea, and after all the pain she has through with him she still found her light and chooses to be happy by keeping a friendly relationship with Chris Brown despite all the strong opinions the media voices about her decision to remain in contact with him. Her referring to him as a \"vision of ecstasy\" is a play on the words as it is no secret she and Brown partook in the recreational use of the drug together as was seen in her video for We Found Love. When he holds her she feels more alive and they both are shining like diamonds or stars in the sky. She knew right away that they would connect and that this connection would be deeper than any love she has ever felt. She wants them to just go on loving each other tonight and to be on the same page with that love, eye to eye, in the way they feel and make love with each other. Moonshine and Molly are drugs. Moonshine is a type of very strong liquor that is homemade in the South and Molly is a street-name for the drug ecstasy. They are doing these drugs together and dancing, arms up with palms in the sky, to the universe. Under the influence of these drugs they feel as though they are stronger and better than when on their own, without drugs or each other so she wants them to continue to do what it takes to shine like a star, or, in Rihanna's and Chris' case, a superstar on the planet. Superstars on the planet eventually die and are forgotten, they will never be as immortal as a shooting star in the sky, as Rihanna hopes. That's just my thoughts. This song is not about drugs and alcohol. It is about self worth and empowerment. I think it is meant to encourage people to embrace their imperfections,and that true value is not in material objects, but in the realization of inner happiness and confidence. Sia wrote this song to remind people that they are beautiful. Sure, there are references to drugs and alcohol, but those are things that hurt us and have little worth. They do not help us find true happiness. If anything, they lead us astray from the path to it. \"Shine bright\" is telling us to show our true colors. \"Find light in the beautiful sea I choose to be happy\" shares that objects are worthless compared to joy. I was gobsmacked yesterday rereading the nursey rhyme, twinkle twinkle little star and the allusion thereto. I was with my grade six learner and was amazed at the connection. The part where she says she finds light in the beautiful sea scares me.I think this song has many hidden spiritual meanings Well first of this song has little to do with Rhianna she is only voice of the song - the text really has been done by Sia (and producers). Sia has a lot of experience with drugs like extacy LSD and alcohol. \"Lucy in the sky with diamonds\" - Shine bright like a diamond... Molly etc... Backward message was so 80' but really think about this buddy - brain does NOT \"understand\" any backward messsages - it does not go after every 10 second and then put things and start to do time reversing - that is absurd. Thing is, you find what you seek when you listen songs backward. Yes I know there are songs where at the time musicans did put messages backward for purpose... mostly at the 80\n\nquestion: What are the overarching themes of the song 'Diamonds'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Resurrection, second chances, universal energy, drugs, alcohol, self worth, empowerment, happiness, inner happiness, confidence, becoming inseparable, love, and hidden spiritual meanings.", "usage": 1143}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

How little can you know about your own religion sigh... didnt you already know that there was another person related into same star and he was Jesus Christ. \"19 We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.\" - 2 peter 1:19. If you look at the history of Christianity you will soon notice that really, Christian religion has had times it has mostly be good for people and society and times it has been bad - perhaps this is reason why Jesus told things like he is not coming with peace rather than sword etc etc. Christian religion has been Christ and anti-Christ at the same time. Christ is the morning star and Lucifer. Ok so you guys probably know this already but if you are like me and very confused on whos song is whos and went here to find out but it only made you more confused then well, im here to answer that. Here, i copy and pasted this from wiki and kinda editied it so i wont get copywrited. Diamond is a song recorded by Rihanna for her seventh studio album Unapologetic. It was written by Sia with her producers, Benny Blanco and StarGate. idk if thats confusing or not but it basically means rihanna sang the song and sia wrote it with her producers or so i assume. (i do not know if this is correct or not so dont hate on me,also, you can correct me if you want but I really wont care because im just trying to help sooo :/ ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamonds_(Rihanna_song) Please, you just have to know that this song Diamond is deep and spiritual so let's think about it from the Bible perspective. Lucifer is referred to as light, and Diamond can also represent something that is shining because the Bible made us understand that Lucifer is the morning star. When you look closely at the video, she looks scared and running away from the light coming after her and at some point, she stopped and looking up in the sky. I also noticed towards the end of the video, she has tears in her eyes and also she was seen in the sea. This song Diamond has deep meaning and is only the spiritually-minded individuals who can decode the meaning of this song. yo sorry, me i again.. the beauty is, and irony is lol. you are of course all correct. in my opinion. see..its about all of these things... uh do i think tons of songs have an \"illuminati\" agenda..nope. do some? well, lets just call it occult or spiritualism.. yes. without question. more sinister than your standard jeeezuz anything...certainly not. i would say yes, it probably is kabbalah focused.. i dont know Sia, or much about her, none of my biz really..im just here to double check the lyrics cuz love it, and was for ME, about Lucifer, satan, that guy..and i LOVE IT AND HAIL SATAN! he is the light and yes, great tune. slappin mix btw, i hardly ever have this impression on pop songs. cuz im not insane like youtube freasks blabla dont core if the illumanit is hidingjkf in my dollar bills or some crap. cuz had NOTHING TO DO with ME or Im willing bet you.. to the person that above, who is just aching to prove to you that this song has a satanic agenda.. YES ok, but guess what peaches..ANY SONG can, if you want it to. that the beauty im talking about folks... so, sure u convinced me..in fact, i liked the song, AND you overwhelming proved to me it, you said look it up! so i did. and ya know what? i rather liked what i saw! thank you! you have converted me from an evangelical dip s hit to using my own brain today. feels good. also my phone wont stop ringing with recruits.. we burned down 763 churches just for you and started a satanic ufo suicide cult. thanks im gonna name the mothership in your honor.. this one...umm yeah.. are you stupid???? sorry is it about chris brown? sure? satan? sure cuz satan is everything around us, he is the light. do you have light in your heart? i do. why not eat that fruit? well mostly not this though lol nice try, but hey thats free thinking so youre already on a left path You are all wrong, The song represents something she has seen in a vision. It is the God of living waters, He has diamonds of light that radiate throughout his body. He is revealing himself to her, He has looked through the spect\n\nquestion: What are the overarching themes of the song 'Diamonds'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1104}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He is the creator and the one who planted the seed of life. He is the one that revealith a new King, bla bla trust me nobody cares but im actually glad you see something for what you want cool... hey shit heads. This song in MY opinion, is CLEARLY SATANIC! AND THATS WHY I LOVE IT!!! HAIL SATAN!!!! you honestly think those baby raping pieces of trash could ever knock a banger like this?? u dumb. in fact, prob so dumb that you cant use your own mind gifted to you. and you must follow what other d ildos tell you to....Satan represents the individual spirit, the urge to fend for the self, serve the self, and rely on the self. As Satan would not be subjugated to another, so it should be with the Satanist. This individualism extends to personal responsibility; that all choices are you own, even only how you react to random events. Allowing another to take credit for your successes or blame for your failures shows a weakness in personal character, and sets you up to be manipulated by those around you. It is delusional to wait for someone, man or god, to save you. Your salvation should be of your own making. While it is these characteristics that Satan is best known for, his creative ability is often ignored. Satan encourages the act of creation and the appreciation of the creative act. In mythology, Satan is attributed with patronage of the arts, especially as an expression of personal ego. In modern times, some have gone as far as suggesting Satan is at the root of our movies, music, and literature. Satanists are well served to seek their own means of creative expression. in closing, read those lyrics. sure maybe sia didnt write it as a love song to satan, but for me..she did. case in point. #2 Palms rise to the universe bitch, u think this song is about jesus? i feel sorry for you. or you are maybe idk kinda retarded i guess..think what you want though. cuz thats satanic freethinking already lemme ask you this? whats so bad satan> what did he ever do to you?? did he or man who guilt trip you about some original sin? take you money and did satan he make you ashamed of you body??nope never! what caring god wouldnt want you to pleasure yourself? either way, have nice. day. also, if it makes feel good and doesnt hurt anybody or creatures, why not? if you want to that is. also, fornicate and sodomize everything possible. better yes, fuck a priest, right up his faggot assss. whoopee, then whisper in his ear, thats he the bad guy..they fucked up this earth. killing millions. source: go outside btw this person MOSTLY nailed it as well Shine bright like a diamond. Everyone please do my a favor and look up what the Devil has wrote in his bible.. WRONG NOT THE \"DEVIL\" IT AIWASS. WHO AMAZINGLY DICTATED IT USING AL'S WIFE AS A MEDIUM. FOR THOSE THAT DONT KNOW,ALEISTER CROWLEY AKA 666 WAS A KICK ASS GUY,AND LOVED CLIMBING K2 AND OTHER MOUNTAINS, AND PUTTING CUM IN BUMS RUNNING CULTS, EATING SOME TURDS AND INSPIRING HEAVY METAL. THANKS AL! \"The law of Thelema.\" His law is to \"Do what thou wilt SHALL BE THE WHOLE OF THE LAW\". This means to do what you want, however you want and whenever you want. The meaning of this song is your a star and that everyone is and that you should shine bright. In the book of the law it says \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" All the songs she sings is glorification of self. A satanism agenda that's why this song is beautiful As we moonshine and molly Feel the warmth, we\u2019ll never die We\u2019re like diamonds in the sky I think to be in that relationship to between those love to the song but it\u2019s so much fun I got a relationship with a guy on my chat with strangers, I asked him out to go on a date. Then we can be boyfriend and girlfriend. It\u2019s so sweet. I love that song to make this deal to me. But I\u2019ve always had my boyfriend his name is. Lucas he\u2019s on my chatting on my website he\u2019s so cute and sweet. I love him he\u2019s a sweet guy. This song is clearly spiritual. People shouldn\u2019t take everything in a song as literal like comments that it is about chris brown.

Rihanna is spiritual by nature and you will be surprised how many big hitters on the scene are spiritual. Spirituality gives you a wider view of reality and this awareness allows them to become so successful. Please people stop seeing music as something that they dislike or have experienced in this material world.
