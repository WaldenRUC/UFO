They usually have two or three long, thin blades that look like an airplane propeller. Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs): These turbines have their axis of rotation oriented vertically. Unlike HAWTs, they don't need to be pointed towards the wind to be effective.", "phrase": "HAWTs usually have two or three long, thin blades and need to be pointed towards the wind, while VAWTs have their axis of rotation oriented vertically and don't need to be pointed towards the wind to be effective."}, {"question": "How does a Darrieus Wind Turbine create rotation?", "sentence": "Darrieus Wind Turbine: This is a type of vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) but with a different design. It uses lift forces generated by the wind hitting the turbine's airfoil-shaped blades to create rotation.", "phrase": "It uses lift forces generated by the wind hitting the turbine's airfoil-shaped blades to create rotation."}, {"question": "What determines the choice of turbine for a wind energy project?", "sentence": "Each of these types has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of turbine depends on the specific requirements of the wind energy project.", "phrase": "The specific requirements of the wind energy project."}]}
