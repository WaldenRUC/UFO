The transition from network to streaming went off without a hitch (and no server crashes) and fans of the franchise were treated to two commercial-free hours of competition. And what a competition it was! Judge Len Goodman was shocked that he gave out as many 7s and 8s as he did during the first week. If last night was any indication, we\u2019re in for a stellar season. But, as always, there\u2019s one dancing pair who won\u2019t get to see next week, let alone the rest of the season. So, who went home after getting eliminated during the voting on Dancing with the Stars last night? We\u2019re here to break the news to you \u2014 SPOILERS ahead. The star/pro combo who was eliminated in week one was actor Jason Lewis and professional Peta Murgatroyd. The pair danced the cha-cha to \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d but the song title didn\u2019t rub off on Lewis. He admitted in his intro video that he\u2019s a horrible dancer and was mostly familiar with \u201cwhiskey dancing\u201d and \u201ctequila dancing.\u201d The judges clocked some timing issues and noticed that Lewis was counting to himself during the performance. His big problem? Always leading with his heel instead of his toe during a cha-cha-cha! The couple earned a score of 18 \u2014 which actually was the second-lowest score of the night. That dubious honor went to Jersey Shore star Vinny Guadagnino and Koko Iwasaki with a 17. That honor went to TikTok star Charli D\u2019Amelio, who actually has a whole lot of professional dancing experience. It showed in her team-up with partner Mark Ballas. The two took the stage and slayed a cha-cha-cha to Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s \u201cSavage (Major Lazer Remix),\u201d proving that this season of DWTS ain\u2019t your mom\u2019s season of DWTS\u2026 and that\u2019s saying something because Charli\u2019s mom Heidi is also competing on DWTS. The scores from last night\u2019s premiere shook out like this: Who will go home next week? The competition is already flaming hot, with so many dancers tied for the top spots.

The transition from network to streaming went off without a hitch (and no server crashes) and fans of the franchise were treated to two commercial-free hours of competition. And what a competition it was! Judge Len Goodman was shocked that he gave out as many 7s and 8s as he did during the first week. If last night was any indication, we\u2019re in for a stellar season. But, as always, there\u2019s one dancing pair who won\u2019t get to see next week, let alone the rest of the season. So, who went home after getting eliminated during the voting on Dancing with the Stars last night? We\u2019re here to break the news to you \u2014 SPOILERS ahead. The star/pro combo who was eliminated in week one was actor Jason Lewis and professional Peta Murgatroyd. The pair danced the cha-cha to \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d but the song title didn\u2019t rub off on Lewis. He admitted in his intro video that he\u2019s a horrible dancer and was mostly familiar with \u201cwhiskey dancing\u201d and \u201ctequila dancing.\u201d The judges clocked some timing issues and noticed that Lewis was counting to himself during the performance. His big problem? Always leading with his heel instead of his toe during a cha-cha-cha! The couple earned a score of 18 \u2014 which actually was the second-lowest score of the night. That dubious honor went to Jersey Shore star Vinny Guadagnino and Koko Iwasaki with a 17. That honor went to TikTok star Charli D\u2019Amelio, who actually has a whole lot of professional dancing experience. It showed in her team-up with partner Mark Ballas. The two took the stage and slayed a cha-cha-cha to Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s \u201cSavage (Major Lazer Remix),\u201d proving that this season of DWTS ain\u2019t your mom\u2019s season of DWTS\u2026 and that\u2019s saying something because Charli\u2019s mom Heidi is also competing on DWTS. The scores from last night\u2019s premiere shook out like this: Who will go home next week? The competition is already flaming hot, with so many dancers tied for the top spots. Will any of them pull ahead, or will there be some surprising dips? Dancing With The Stars: How To Vote By Text Wondering how you can help lead to the next elimination \u2013 or save your fave?
