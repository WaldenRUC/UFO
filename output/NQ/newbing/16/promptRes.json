Originally written to honor soldiers overseas who longed to be home at Christmas time, \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" has since gone on to become a Christmas standard. The song is sung from the point of view of a soldier stationed overseas during World War II, writing a letter to his family. In the message, he tells his family he will be coming home and to prepare the holiday for him, and requests snow, mistletoe, and presents under the tree. The song ends on a melancholy note, with the soldier saying, \"I'll be home for Christmas, if only in my dreams\". The flip side of the original recording (Decca 18570B) was \"Danny Boy.\" The song was written by the lyricist Kim Gannon and composer Walter Kent. Songwriter and later producer and manager for The Platters, Buck Ram, who said he previously wrote a poem and song with the same title, was credited as a co-writer of the song following a lawsuit brought by Ram's publisher, Mills Music. Bing Crosby's original 1943 release of the song on Decca Records listed only Walter Kent and Kim Gannon as the songwriters on the record label. Later pressings added the name of Buck Ram to the songwriting credit. On October 1, 1943, Crosby recorded the song under the title \"I'll Be Home for Christmas (If Only in My Dreams)\", with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra for Decca Records; it was released as a 78 rpm single, Decca 18570A, Matrix #L3203, and reissued in 1946 as Decca 23779. Within a month of release, the song charted for 11 weeks, with a peak at number three. The next year, the song reached number 16 on the charts. The U.S. War Department also released Bing Crosby's performance of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" from the December 7, 1944, Kraft Music Hall broadcast with the Henderson Choir, J.S.T., on V-Disc, as U.S. Army V-Disc No. 441-B and U.S. Navy V-Disc No. 221B, Matrix #VP1253-D5TC206. The song from the broadcast has appeared in many Bing Crosby compilations. In the midst of World War II, the song touched the hearts of Americans, both soldiers and civilians, and it earned Crosby his fifth gold record. \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" became the most requested song at Christmas U.S.O. shows. The GI magazine Yank said Crosby \"accomplished more for military morale than anyone else of that era\". Despite the song's popularity with Americans at the front and at home, in the UK the BBC banned the song from broadcast, as the Corporation's management felt the lyrics might lower morale among British troops. Seventy-seven years after its original release, Bing Crosby's \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (at number 50 on the chart dated January 2, 2021). Elvis Presley recorded the song in September 1957, and was featured on the LP Elvis' Christmas Album. Singer Johnny Mathis also covered the song on his Merry Christmas album in 1958, which was the #2 Christmas album of 1963 and 1964 as there were no Christmas album rankings prior to 1963. In December 1965, astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, while on Gemini 7, requested \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" be played for them by the NASA ground crew. Since the incarnation of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1958, cover versions by Cuban-American singer Camila Cabello and American singers Kelly Clarkson and Josh Groban are the only versions of the song to enter the chart.

It is one of the season\u2019s most beloved Christmas songs, and royalties from the song are given back to St. Lawrence University each time it is played on the radio. J. Kimball \u201cKim\u201d Gannon, a graduate of St. Lawrence in 1924, in New York, composed \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home for Christmas\u201d along with two others. It was not Gannon, however, who made the song popular. It was Bing Crosby who first recorded the song in 1943 that became a top-10 hit during the mid-1940s, as Americans were in the midst of World War II. The lyrics resonated with soldiers longing to be home, \u201cif only in my dreams.\u201d \u201cIt came out of a time when we had servicemen fighting a war in Europe against tyranny and one day a year, maybe, the serviceman got a breather from fighting and had a chance to reflect on the happy times and the things they would like to get back to.\u201d Gannon is also given credit for writing the alma mater for St. Lawrence. In his will he declared that the University is to be given a portion of his royalties from all his compositions in his will. Since September 2000, St. Lawrence has gained nearly $500,000 from the royalties of Gannon\u2019s music. Gannon died in 1974. No doubt, this time of year invokes memories of Christmases past. Whether it is a fond moment or a moment in time that may have resulted in our tears slowing us down, the song captures our emotions even today, with its powerful lyrics. I am particularly reminded of life as a child when the burden of being responsible was in the great hands of my parents. As I listen to the song, I remember the importance of family. As I have said many times, my mother and father showered us with love and affection-not always verbally, but with their actions. Although my mother was a great cook every day, Christmas really brought out her culinary skills. The smell of her wonderful pies and cakes being cooked and baked on a wooden stove wafting through the house, gave special meaning to the season. It was a time of year that our home was always crowded with guest, black and white, interested in sampling her daily creations. There was an unwritten rule in our family. No matter where life takes you, always come home for Christmas. Except for being out of the country for an extended period, until my parents\u2019 death, I was always home for Christmas.\n\nquestion: Who wrote the song 'I'll Be Home for Christmas'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "J.

It is one of the season\u2019s most beloved Christmas songs, and royalties from the song are given back to St. Lawrence University each time it is played on the radio. J. Kimball \u201cKim\u201d Gannon, a graduate of St. Lawrence in 1924, in New York, composed \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home for Christmas\u201d along with two others. It was not Gannon, however, who made the song popular. It was Bing Crosby who first recorded the song in 1943 that became a top-10 hit during the mid-1940s, as Americans were in the midst of World War II. The lyrics resonated with soldiers longing to be home, \u201cif only in my dreams.\u201d \u201cIt came out of a time when we had servicemen fighting a war in Europe against tyranny and one day a year, maybe, the serviceman got a breather from fighting and had a chance to reflect on the happy times and the things they would like to get back to.\u201d Gannon is also given credit for writing the alma mater for St. Lawrence. In his will he declared that the University is to be given a portion of his royalties from all his compositions in his will. Since September 2000, St. Lawrence has gained nearly $500,000 from the royalties of Gannon\u2019s music. Gannon died in 1974. No doubt, this time of year invokes memories of Christmases past. Whether it is a fond moment or a moment in time that may have resulted in our tears slowing us down, the song captures our emotions even today, with its powerful lyrics. I am particularly reminded of life as a child when the burden of being responsible was in the great hands of my parents. As I listen to the song, I remember the importance of family. As I have said many times, my mother and father showered us with love and affection-not always verbally, but with their actions. Although my mother was a great cook every day, Christmas really brought out her culinary skills. The smell of her wonderful pies and cakes being cooked and baked on a wooden stove wafting through the house, gave special meaning to the season. It was a time of year that our home was always crowded with guest, black and white, interested in sampling her daily creations. There was an unwritten rule in our family. No matter where life takes you, always come home for Christmas. Except for being out of the country for an extended period, until my parents\u2019 death, I was always home for Christmas.\n\nquestion: Who originally recorded 'I'll Be Home for Christmas' in 1943?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Bing Crosby", "usage": 691}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Originally written to honor soldiers overseas who longed to be home at Christmas time, \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" has since gone on to become a Christmas standard. The song is sung from the point of view of a soldier stationed overseas during World War II, writing a letter to his family. In the message, he tells his family he will be coming home and to prepare the holiday for him, and requests snow, mistletoe, and presents under the tree. The song ends on a melancholy note, with the soldier saying, \"I'll be home for Christmas, if only in my dreams\". The flip side of the original recording (Decca 18570B) was \"Danny Boy.\" The song was written by the lyricist Kim Gannon and composer Walter Kent. Songwriter and later producer and manager for The Platters, Buck Ram, who said he previously wrote a poem and song with the same title, was credited as a co-writer of the song following a lawsuit brought by Ram's publisher, Mills Music. Bing Crosby's original 1943 release of the song on Decca Records listed only Walter Kent and Kim Gannon as the songwriters on the record label. Later pressings added the name of Buck Ram to the songwriting credit. On October 1, 1943, Crosby recorded the song under the title \"I'll Be Home for Christmas (If Only in My Dreams)\", with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra for Decca Records; it was released as a 78 rpm single, Decca 18570A, Matrix #L3203, and reissued in 1946 as Decca 23779. Within a month of release, the song charted for 11 weeks, with a peak at number three. The next year, the song reached number 16 on the charts. The U.S. War Department also released Bing Crosby's performance of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" from the December 7, 1944, Kraft Music Hall broadcast with the Henderson Choir, J.S.T., on V-Disc, as U.S. Army V-Disc No. 441-B and U.S. Navy V-Disc No. 221B, Matrix #VP1253-D5TC206. The song from the broadcast has appeared in many Bing Crosby compilations. In the midst of World War II, the song touched the hearts of Americans, both soldiers and civilians, and it earned Crosby his fifth gold record. \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" became the most requested song at Christmas U.S.O. shows. The GI magazine Yank said Crosby \"accomplished more for military morale than anyone else of that era\". Despite the song's popularity with Americans at the front and at home, in the UK the BBC banned the song from broadcast, as the Corporation's management felt the lyrics might lower morale among British troops. Seventy-seven years after its original release, Bing Crosby's \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (at number 50 on the chart dated January 2, 2021). Elvis Presley recorded the song in September 1957, and was featured on the LP Elvis' Christmas Album. Singer Johnny Mathis also covered the song on his Merry Christmas album in 1958, which was the #2 Christmas album of 1963 and 1964 as there were no Christmas album rankings prior to 1963.

The lyrics resonated with soldiers longing to be home, \u201cif only in my dreams.\u201d \u201cIt came out of a time when we had servicemen fighting a war in Europe against tyranny and one day a year, maybe, the serviceman got a breather from fighting and had a chance to reflect on the happy times and the things they would like to get back to.\u201d Gannon is also given credit for writing the alma mater for St. Lawrence. In his will he declared that the University is to be given a portion of his royalties from all his compositions in his will. Since September 2000, St. Lawrence has gained nearly $500,000 from the royalties of Gannon\u2019s music. Gannon died in 1974. No doubt, this time of year invokes memories of Christmases past. Whether it is a fond moment or a moment in time that may have resulted in our tears slowing us down, the song captures our emotions even today, with its powerful lyrics. I am particularly reminded of life as a child when the burden of being responsible was in the great hands of my parents. As I listen to the song, I remember the importance of family. As I have said many times, my mother and father showered us with love and affection-not always verbally, but with their actions. Although my mother was a great cook every day, Christmas really brought out her culinary skills. The smell of her wonderful pies and cakes being cooked and baked on a wooden stove wafting through the house, gave special meaning to the season. It was a time of year that our home was always crowded with guest, black and white, interested in sampling her daily creations. There was an unwritten rule in our family. No matter where life takes you, always come home for Christmas. Except for being out of the country for an extended period, until my parents\u2019 death, I was always home for Christmas.\n\nquestion: What was listed on the original 1943 release of the song by Bing Crosby?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 691}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Originally written to honor soldiers overseas who longed to be home at Christmas time, \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" has since gone on to become a Christmas standard. The song is sung from the point of view of a soldier stationed overseas during World War II, writing a letter to his family. In the message, he tells his family he will be coming home and to prepare the holiday for him, and requests snow, mistletoe, and presents under the tree. The song ends on a melancholy note, with the soldier saying, \"I'll be home for Christmas, if only in my dreams\". The flip side of the original recording (Decca 18570B) was \"Danny Boy.\" The song was written by the lyricist Kim Gannon and composer Walter Kent. Songwriter and later producer and manager for The Platters, Buck Ram, who said he previously wrote a poem and song with the same title, was credited as a co-writer of the song following a lawsuit brought by Ram's publisher, Mills Music. Bing Crosby's original 1943 release of the song on Decca Records listed only Walter Kent and Kim Gannon as the songwriters on the record label. Later pressings added the name of Buck Ram to the songwriting credit. On October 1, 1943, Crosby recorded the song under the title \"I'll Be Home for Christmas (If Only in My Dreams)\", with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra for Decca Records; it was released as a 78 rpm single, Decca 18570A, Matrix #L3203, and reissued in 1946 as Decca 23779. Within a month of release, the song charted for 11 weeks, with a peak at number three. The next year, the song reached number 16 on the charts. The U.S. War Department also released Bing Crosby's performance of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" from the December 7, 1944, Kraft Music Hall broadcast with the Henderson Choir, J.S.T., on V-Disc, as U.S. Army V-Disc No. 441-B and U.S. Navy V-Disc No. 221B, Matrix #VP1253-D5TC206. The song from the broadcast has appeared in many Bing Crosby compilations. In the midst of World War II, the song touched the hearts of Americans, both soldiers and civilians, and it earned Crosby his fifth gold record. \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" became the most requested song at Christmas U.S.O. shows. The GI magazine Yank said Crosby \"accomplished more for military morale than anyone else of that era\". Despite the song's popularity with Americans at the front and at home, in the UK the BBC banned the song from broadcast, as the Corporation's management felt the lyrics might lower morale among British troops. Seventy-seven years after its original release, Bing Crosby's \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (at number 50 on the chart dated January 2, 2021). Elvis Presley recorded the song in September 1957, and was featured on the LP Elvis' Christmas Album. Singer Johnny Mathis also covered the song on his Merry Christmas album in 1958, which was the #2 Christmas album of 1963 and 1964 as there were no Christmas album rankings prior to 1963. In December 1965, astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, while on Gemini 7, requested \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" be played for them by the NASA ground crew. Since the incarnation of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1958, cover versions by Cuban-American singer Camila Cabello and American singers Kelly Clarkson and Josh Groban are the only versions of the song to enter the chart.

It is one of the season\u2019s most beloved Christmas songs, and royalties from the song are given back to St. Lawrence University each time it is played on the radio. J. Kimball \u201cKim\u201d Gannon, a graduate of St. Lawrence in 1924, in New York, composed \u201cI\u2019ll Be Home for Christmas\u201d along with two others. It was not Gannon, however, who made the song popular. It was Bing Crosby who first recorded the song in 1943 that became a top-10 hit during the mid-1940s, as Americans were in the midst of World War II.
