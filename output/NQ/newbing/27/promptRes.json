It was a change in caliber that took the watch from the brand\u2019s underperforming also-ran and transformed it into the hottest horological property of the last 30 years. A model Rolex could barely give away for the first quarter century of its production is now one so in demand that you have more chance of being struck by lightning on your way to buying a winning lottery ticket than picking one up new from your local authorized retailer. So how much difference can one movement have over another? Throughout its life, the Rolex Daytona has had three generations of movements \u2013 the manual-wind Valjoux calibers, followed by two automatic movements: one based on the Zenith El Primero, and most recently, one that is entirely of Rolex\u2019s own design: the Cal. 4130. It is these last movements that made the Daytona what it is today, both fantastically accomplished calibers with a host of differences. Below we take a look at both in a bit more detail. The battle to create the world\u2019s first automatically-winding mechanical chronograph movement ended in a sort of three-way tie in 1969. The competitors \u2013 Seiko in Japan and two Swiss entrants: Zenith (teaming up with fellow countrymen Movado) and a consortium called the Chronomatic Group (consisting of Heuer, Breitling, Hamilton-Buren, and Dubois Depraz) all released their own takes on the challenge that year. Zenith were the first to announce their caliber (the El Primero) in January, but it didn\u2019t actually become available until the following September. Seiko won the race to market, their 6139 launching in May, but with a frequency of 21,600vph, it was outperformed by the Zenith, which famously beat at 36,000vph and was able to measure time down to 1/10th second. The Caliber 11 from the Chronomatic Group also surfaced earlier, released in August, but it was an already existing movement with a chrono module retrofitted to it and experienced a number of problems from the outset. In terms of the overall winner in a closely-run race, most experts give the title to Zenith. Unfortunately, the self-winding chronograph movement was perfected just in time to coincide with the quartz crisis, which bankrupted nearly two-thirds of Switzerland\u2019s traditional brands. Zenith themselves came within a whisker of it, eventually being bought out by the Chicago-based Zenith Radio Corporation (no relation) in 1971. That could well have been the end for the El Primero (and possibly the Rolex Daytona too), but by the end of the decade the world had started to grow tired of the soullessness of electronics and were clamoring once again for the heritage and artistry of mechanical watches. Zenith was returned to Swiss hands in 1978 and were able to start production on the El Primero again almost immediately. (For a great story on just how they were able to do that, look up Charles Vermot and his heroic efforts; there\u2019s no room to go into it here sadly). The first big order came from Ebel in 1981, which poured much needed funds back into the manufacturer\u2019s business, and then in 1986, Rolex came knocking, signing a 10-year deal worth around seven million Swiss francs. Two years later, the second generation of the Rolex Daytona surfaced, powered by an automatic movement for the first time. The reason it took so long for the new Daytona to come out following the two companies forming an alliance is because Rolex\u2019s engineers gave the El Primero a severe going-over before fitting it inside the watch. Stripping the movement back to its mainplate, they made more than 200 separate modifications and left it with fewer than half its original components. The most significant were the removal of the date function and the fitting of an entirely new escapement, with a larger free sprung Glucydur balance wheel and Rolex\u2019s own Microstella regulating system. In addition, the flat hairspring was given a Breguet overcoil and the frequency was brought in line with the rest of the brand\u2019s lineup, dropping from 36,000vph to 28,800vph. The resulting movement was christened the Cal. 4030 and debuted inside the Rolex Daytona ref. 16520 in 1988. The ref. 165XX series of watches was the one to turn the Rolex Daytona into the legend it is today, revolutionizing the reputation of the much maligned watch practically overnight. However, as spectacular a success as it was, in Rolex\u2019s eyes it still had one fatal flaw. With the new millennium on the horizon, the Rolex Daytona was the only model in the brand\u2019s portfolio reliant on a third\n\nquestion: When did the Rolex Daytona start using the Zenith El Primero movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "1988", "usage": 1092}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

After five years of development, the brand closed the loop and introduced the Cal. 4130 movement, the in-house engine that would drive the third generation of their chronograph. Outwardly, the new iteration of the Rolex Daytona was strikingly similar to the one it replaced, but inside, the movements were vastly different. Generally accepted as one of the finest mechanisms of its type ever made, the Cal. 4130 exemplifies Rolex\u2019s drive for efficiency, drawing the highest level of performance out of the smallest number of parts. In all, it is made up of just 201 components (20% fewer than the El Primero) making it just about the lowest of any modern chronograph movement. It has taken the sort of creative engineering for which Rolex is rightly famous. The minute and hour stopwatch functions, for example, which were controlled by two individual modules in Zenith\u2019s caliber, have been combined into a single unit on the Cal. 4130. That has freed up enough space for a larger mainspring, upping the power reserve from 50 to 72 hours. It also means that the chronograph module only needs one screw for its adjustment, as opposed to five on the previous movement. Other changes can be found on the self-winding system, which now uses ball bearings, making it 68% more efficient. The Cal. 4130 was also the movement chosen to debut Rolex\u2019s patented Parachrom hairspring, made from an antimagnetic alloy of niobium and zirconium which is impervious to temperature variations and offers up to 10 times the shock resistance compared to standard springs. In 2005 it was updated again, given a thicker oxide coating which caused it to change color when reacting with the air, and giving rise to its new name of the Blue Parachrom. But perhaps most importantly is the use of a vertical clutch. Where the El Primero employed a horizontal, or lateral, arrangement to control the chronograph, the Cal. 4130 has a pair of discs one on top of the other, running in constant synch with the drivetrain. Engaging and releasing the discs with the clutch eradicates the tiny jumps on the chrono hands during starts and stops, known as backlash. It not only means a more precise stopwatch, but also the chronograph can be run for longer periods of time without affecting the watch\u2019s overall timekeeping. While it undoubtedly improves upon the outgoing Zenith caliber, you will still find devotees who prefer the El Primero-powered models, which have a charm all their own. Those middle generation watches are also generally the most affordable entryway into Daytona ownership, particularly the two-tone steel and gold Rolesor examples. Rolex\u2019s racing legend has certainly come a long way from the early days of commercial failure, and it really has its movements to thank for much of its success.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Evolution of the Rolex Daytona Movement\n\nevidence: Shop New Arrivals Following the manually-wound Rolex Daytona lineup that made its debut in the early 1960s, Rolex unveiled the automatic Daytona collection in 1988. Gone were the Valjoux-based hand-wound movements inside of the Rolex Daytona in favor of Zenith El-Primero-based self-winding movements. The affectionately nicknamed \u2018Zenith Daytona\u2019 watches were around for 12 years until Rolex finally introduced a collection of automatic Daytona watches powered by their first in-house chronograph movement. At first glance, the two generations of the automatic Daytona look the same, both following similar design blueprints. Yet, upon closer inspection, the Daytona dial reveals which movement lies inside the watch \u2013 which is practical given that Rolex watches never come with a transparent exhibition caseback. If you\u2019re unsure how, read on to learn how to spot a Zenith movement inside a Rolex Daytona by looking at the dial. The first batch of automatic Daytona watches housed the Rolex Caliber 4030, which was based on the El-Primero Caliber 400 by Zenith. Caliber 400 was, in fact, a resurrection (brought back in 1985) of the pioneering Zenith El-Primero Cal. 3019PHC made from 1969-1975. You may recall that Zenith was one of the first watchmakers (it\u2019s an on-going debate in the watch world as to who can actually claim the title of the very first) to produce a self-winding chronograph movement in 1969. Although the Zenith Caliber 400 was a fantastic self-winding chronograph movement, Rolex did heavily modify it according to the needs of the Daytona. After all was said and done, only about 50% of the original base remained. Some of the most noteworthy modifications included reducing the frequency rate from 36,000 beats per hour to 28,800bph, removing the date function, and adding a new escapement with a Breguet overcoil. The Caliber 4030 uses a lateral clutch chronograph system and has a 54-hour power reserve. Zenith Daytona watches have five-digit reference numbers (165xx) and were produced from 1988 until 2000. It took Rolex five years to develop the in-house Caliber 4130, which made its debut in 2000 inside the new generation Daytona watches with six-digit reference numbers (1165xx). Compared to the 4030, the Caliber 4130 provided great improvements in terms of performance, power reserve, and serviceability. First of all, in direct contrast to its predecessor, Caliber 4130 uses a vertical clutch chronograph system. This system not only permits the chronograph to run for long periods with no influence on the watch\u2019s timekeeping accuracy, but it also eliminates the jitteriness of the chronograph hand when it starts/stops/resets. Rolex also increased the size of the mainspring barrel inside the 4130 to supply an increased 72-hour power reserve. Additionally, Rolex reduced the number of parts inside the movement to facilitate servicing. Almost two decades after it was first released, the in-house Rolex Caliber 4130 still stands as one of the best self-winding chronograph movements ever made. As chronographs, both the Caliber 4030 and the Caliber 4130 Daytona models have a trio of subsidiary dials on the dial in the familiar 3, 6, and 9 o\u2019clock layout. However, looks-wise, the order of the sub-dials is what distinguishes the Zenith Daytona from the in-house Daytona. On the Zenith Daytona watches, the 30-minute counter is located at 3 o\u2019clock, the 12-hour counter is located at 6 o\u2019clock, and the running seconds is located at 9 o\u2019clock. On the in-house Caliber 4130 Daytona watches, the running seconds is located at 6 o\u2019clock and the 12-hour counter is located at 9 o\u2019clock \u2013 those two sub-dials switched positions while the 30-minute counter remained in its original location. So the quickest way to spot a Zenith movement inside a Rolex Daytona by looking at the dial is checking to see if the running seconds is indeed at 9 o\u2019clock. The Zenith Daytona watches also have slimmer hour markers than their successors, and the placement of the three registers is more centered compared to the slightly off-centered placement of the later Daytona ref. 116xx models. Finally, the sub-dial rings on the stainless steel Zenith Daytona ref. 16520 are black on the white dial versions and off-white on the black dial versions while silver rings are used on the subsequent stainless steel Daytona ref. 116520. There you have it, a simple way to distinguish the early Zenith Daytona watches from the later in-house movement-powered Daytona watches without having to open up any casebacks!

With that said, they have not been powered by the same caliber. In this article, we\u2019ll look at the Rolex chronographs (pre-Daytona) and the different Daytona generations, and which movements they used. Which movement does the Daytona have? The predecessor to the Rolex Daytona was released in 1955 and has the reference 6234. This reference was not labeled nor named Daytona, but the model does share a lot of similar design traits as the current Daytona. You may say that this is the seed to the Daytona we have today. The reference was discontinued in 1961. This model wasn\u2019t very successful and relatively few pieces were made (about 500). However, it was the beginning of the legendary Daytona that we have today. The Rolex Chronograph reference 6234 is equipped with the Rolex Caliber 72. This is a manual mechanical movement with 17 jewels, a column-wheel construction, and a horizontal clutch. The movement is actually a Valjoux base. In 1965, Rolex released the chronograph reference 6240. This was the first chronograph from Rolex to use screw-in push buttons. The screw-down pushers keep dust and water from entering the case. This reference was produced from 1965 to 1969. Rolex made it as an experimental model. The Rolex 6240 uses a modified Valjoux movement, of which Rolex increased the frequency from 18,000 to 21,600 VPH. For this reference, Rolex used three calibers \u2013 the calibers 72B, 722, and 722-1. The caliber 72B was only used in 1965, the caliber 722 was used between about 1965 to 1968, and the caliber 722-1 was used approximately during the 2 last years of production. Rolex released the watch that is today known as the \u201dZenith Daytona\u201d in 1988. The name gives it away, but the reason it is called \u201dZenith Daytona\u201d is due to the fact that it uses a Zenith movement. In this reference, Rolex used a self-winding chronograph caliber, based Zenith\u2019s El Primero movement which was released in 1969. The Zenith movement was heavily modified by Rolex, including reducing the frequency from 36,000 to 28,800 VPH. Reducing the frequency meant upping the power reserve and reducing the wear and friction of the movement, which leads to longer service intervals. Since Rolex did such heavy modifications on this caliber, and to make it appear as an in-house Rolex movement, Rolex named the caliber 4030. In the year 2000, Rolex released its first fully in-house movement for the Daytona. This movement was presented in the new reference 116520 (including gold variants). The caliber was named 4130, which is a natural name change from the 4030 to highlight that it is a new-generation movement. The caliber 4130 has a 72-hour power reserve, 44 jewels, vertical coupling, column wheel, and Kif shock absorbers for the balance and escape wheel. The new ceramic Daytona reference 116500LN was released in 2016 and is equipped with the same caliber as the previous generation Daytona. Rolex did simply not see a reason to upgrade or change the Daytona caliber 4130 just yet, and so continued on a winning concept. As you can see, the Rolex Daytona (and its predecessors, pre-Daytona) have used a number of different calibers. The majority of these have been externally sourced movements, but the Rolex Daytona received a huge update when Rolex announced its first in-house chronograph movement 4130. This caliber is still used today, 20 years later, which goes to show that Rolex is perfectly satisfied with how the caliber performs and sees no reason to update it just yet. Bear in mind that we have only listed the stainless steel Daytona variant under each title. Many of the Daytona generations were also made in gold and gold & steel variants.

What some collectors might not realize is that Rolex's now-standard 'Perpetual' movement did not always power the famed chronograph. In fact, early Rolex Daytona references relied on Valjoux-based, manually-wound movements, and the collection's first self-winding caliber was based on a design from Zenith, rather than being one of Rolex's own creations. It was actually not until the current generation of Daytona watches that the brand's legendary chronograph finally received a fully in-house movement. The Daytona was not Rolex's first attempt at producing chronograph watches. The brand began selling them decades prior in the late 1930s with watches such as the ref. 2303. It featured two chronograph registers on the dial and a single pusher, which was built into the crown. Several variations of the pre-Daytona chronograph would follow, many of which varied in case size and general design. The Daytona, as we know it today, didn't start to take shape until the release of reference 6238 in 1960. It was powered by the Valjoux 72 B (then later the 722 from about 1965 onwards) and featured the Daytona's signature triple registers on the dial. However, while the ref. 6238 more-or-less resembled a Rolex Daytona, one crucial detail was missing. Its tachymeter scale was printed along the periphery of its dial, rather than on its bezel. It was not until the release of the ref. 6239 in 1963 that the Daytona's tachymeter scale moved to its bezel, and the watch took the form of the Daytona that we all know today. Like its pre-Daytona predecessor, the ref. 6239 was powered by a similar Valjoux 72B movement, which was later replaced by the Valjoux 722. Initially, the watch only featured the distinction \"Cosmograph\" on its dial; the 'Daytona' name didn't start to appear until the mid-1960s - a change that was made to celebrate the brand's status as the official timekeeper of the Daytona Speedway. Although a number of other Rolex Daytona references followed, the Daytona remained a manual-wind chronograph until 1988. During this time, the movement evolved and included the Valjoux 72, 722B, 722/1, and 727 - the last of which upgraded the Daytona to a higher frequency of 21,600bph, improving its overall accuracy. Despite incremental updates, it was not until the 1988 release of the next generation of Daytona watches that Rolex's chronograph finally received an automatic movement. During the 1970s and 1980s, the fact that a manual-wind movement powered the Rolex Daytona during an era in which quartz movements were starting to dominate the market somewhat deterred its success. It wasn't until the release of ref. 16520 in 1988 that the Daytona started to become more widely sought-after among the general public. While this edition was the first Rolex Daytona to run on a self-winding movement, it was based on the Zenith \"El Primero\" chronograph caliber that was then modified by Rolex. The Zenith movement was significantly modified in-house with over half the components swapped out to remove the date complication and lower the frequency to a slower rate of 28,800bph to achieve a longer power reserve. The result was the Cal. 4030, which remained in production until it was finally replaced by Rolex's first in-house chronograph movement in 2000 with the 6-digit reference Daytona watches. This generation of 'Zenith Daytona' watches were the first to feature an increased case size of 40mm and also the first to have a case with crown-guards. Additionally, this generation also introduced lacquered dials and scratch-resistant sapphire crystals to the Rolex Daytona collection, giving this generation a noticeably more contemporary look and feel than its Valjoux-based predecessors. With the 6-digit reference generation of Daytona watches came a self-winding movement that was developed entirely in-house by Rolex: the Caliber 4130. The 44-jewel powerhouse boasted a longer 72-hour power reserve and higher resistance to shocks and magnetism due to the use of Rolex\u2019s proprietary Parachrom hairspring. The update in movement is evident on the dial with slight changes to the positioning of the chronograph registers. The small seconds counter (previously at the 9 o'clock position) swapped places with the 12-hour counter, which sat at the 6 o'clock location on the Zenith movement models. The cal. 4130 remains Rolex's go-to chronograph movement for its incredibly smooth operation and accurate reading, and it is still used to power every modern Daytona watch that Rolex sells today.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Evolution of the Rolex Daytona Movement\n\nevidence: Shop New Arrivals It is fair to say that much of the storied history of the Rolex Daytona really belongs to its movement. It was a change in caliber that took the watch from the brand\u2019s underperforming also-ran and transformed it into the hottest horological property of the last 30 years. A model Rolex could barely give away for the first quarter century of its production is now one so in demand that you have more chance of being struck by lightning on your way to buying a winning lottery ticket than picking one up new from your local authorized retailer. So how much difference can one movement have over another? Throughout its life, the Rolex Daytona has had three generations of movements \u2013 the manual-wind Valjoux calibers, followed by two automatic movements: one based on the Zenith El Primero, and most recently, one that is entirely of Rolex\u2019s own design: the Cal. 4130. It is these last movements that made the Daytona what it is today, both fantastically accomplished calibers with a host of differences. Below we take a look at both in a bit more detail. The battle to create the world\u2019s first automatically-winding mechanical chronograph movement ended in a sort of three-way tie in 1969. The competitors \u2013 Seiko in Japan and two Swiss entrants: Zenith (teaming up with fellow countrymen Movado) and a consortium called the Chronomatic Group (consisting of Heuer, Breitling, Hamilton-Buren, and Dubois Depraz) all released their own takes on the challenge that year. Zenith were the first to announce their caliber (the El Primero) in January, but it didn\u2019t actually become available until the following September. Seiko won the race to market, their 6139 launching in May, but with a frequency of 21,600vph, it was outperformed by the Zenith, which famously beat at 36,000vph and was able to measure time down to 1/10th second. The Caliber 11 from the Chronomatic Group also surfaced earlier, released in August, but it was an already existing movement with a chrono module retrofitted to it and experienced a number of problems from the outset. In terms of the overall winner in a closely-run race, most experts give the title to Zenith. Unfortunately, the self-winding chronograph movement was perfected just in time to coincide with the quartz crisis, which bankrupted nearly two-thirds of Switzerland\u2019s traditional brands. Zenith themselves came within a whisker of it, eventually being bought out by the Chicago-based Zenith Radio Corporation (no relation) in 1971. That could well have been the end for the El Primero (and possibly the Rolex Daytona too), but by the end of the decade the world had started to grow tired of the soullessness of electronics and were clamoring once again for the heritage and artistry of mechanical watches. Zenith was returned to Swiss hands in 1978 and were able to start production on the El Primero again almost immediately. (For a great story on just how they were able to do that, look up Charles Vermot and his heroic efforts; there\u2019s no room to go into it here sadly). The first big order came from Ebel in 1981, which poured much needed funds back into the manufacturer\u2019s business, and then in 1986, Rolex came knocking, signing a 10-year deal worth around seven million Swiss francs. Two years later, the second generation of the Rolex Daytona surfaced, powered by an automatic movement for the first time. The reason it took so long for the new Daytona to come out following the two companies forming an alliance is because Rolex\u2019s engineers gave the El Primero a severe going-over before fitting it inside the watch. Stripping the movement back to its mainplate, they made more than 200 separate modifications and left it with fewer than half its original components. The most significant were the removal of the date function and the fitting of an entirely new escapement, with a larger free sprung Glucydur balance wheel and Rolex\u2019s own Microstella regulating system. In addition, the flat hairspring was given a Breguet overcoil and the frequency was brought in line with the rest of the brand\u2019s lineup, dropping from 36,000vph to 28,800vph. The resulting movement was christened the Cal. 4030 and debuted inside the Rolex Daytona ref. 16520 in 1988. The ref. 165XX series of watches was the one to turn the Rolex Daytona into the legend it is today, revolutionizing the reputation of the much maligned watch practically overnight. However, as spectacular a success as it was, in Rolex\u2019s eyes it still had one fatal flaw.

After five years of development, the brand closed the loop and introduced the Cal. 4130 movement, the in-house engine that would drive the third generation of their chronograph. Outwardly, the new iteration of the Rolex Daytona was strikingly similar to the one it replaced, but inside, the movements were vastly different. Generally accepted as one of the finest mechanisms of its type ever made, the Cal. 4130 exemplifies Rolex\u2019s drive for efficiency, drawing the highest level of performance out of the smallest number of parts. In all, it is made up of just 201 components (20% fewer than the El Primero) making it just about the lowest of any modern chronograph movement. It has taken the sort of creative engineering for which Rolex is rightly famous. The minute and hour stopwatch functions, for example, which were controlled by two individual modules in Zenith\u2019s caliber, have been combined into a single unit on the Cal. 4130. That has freed up enough space for a larger mainspring, upping the power reserve from 50 to 72 hours. It also means that the chronograph module only needs one screw for its adjustment, as opposed to five on the previous movement. Other changes can be found on the self-winding system, which now uses ball bearings, making it 68% more efficient. The Cal. 4130 was also the movement chosen to debut Rolex\u2019s patented Parachrom hairspring, made from an antimagnetic alloy of niobium and zirconium which is impervious to temperature variations and offers up to 10 times the shock resistance compared to standard springs. In 2005 it was updated again, given a thicker oxide coating which caused it to change color when reacting with the air, and giving rise to its new name of the Blue Parachrom. But perhaps most importantly is the use of a vertical clutch. Where the El Primero employed a horizontal, or lateral, arrangement to control the chronograph, the Cal. 4130 has a pair of discs one on top of the other, running in constant synch with the drivetrain. Engaging and releasing the discs with the clutch eradicates the tiny jumps on the chrono hands during starts and stops, known as backlash. It not only means a more precise stopwatch, but also the chronograph can be run for longer periods of time without affecting the watch\u2019s overall timekeeping. While it undoubtedly improves upon the outgoing Zenith caliber, you will still find devotees who prefer the El Primero-powered models, which have a charm all their own. Those middle generation watches are also generally the most affordable entryway into Daytona ownership, particularly the two-tone steel and gold Rolesor examples. Rolex\u2019s racing legend has certainly come a long way from the early days of commercial failure, and it really has its movements to thank for much of its success. Perhaps the most important sports watch of them all, there is room for at least one Rolex Daytona in any watch collection. Subscribe today to receive email updates on our timepieces.

Gone were the Valjoux-based hand-wound movements inside of the Rolex Daytona in favor of Zenith El-Primero-based self-winding movements. The affectionately nicknamed \u2018Zenith Daytona\u2019 watches were around for 12 years until Rolex finally introduced a collection of automatic Daytona watches powered by their first in-house chronograph movement. At first glance, the two generations of the automatic Daytona look the same, both following similar design blueprints. Yet, upon closer inspection, the Daytona dial reveals which movement lies inside the watch \u2013 which is practical given that Rolex watches never come with a transparent exhibition caseback. If you\u2019re unsure how, read on to learn how to spot a Zenith movement inside a Rolex Daytona by looking at the dial. The first batch of automatic Daytona watches housed the Rolex Caliber 4030, which was based on the El-Primero Caliber 400 by Zenith. Caliber 400 was, in fact, a resurrection (brought back in 1985) of the pioneering Zenith El-Primero Cal. 3019PHC made from 1969-1975. You may recall that Zenith was one of the first watchmakers (it\u2019s an on-going debate in the watch world as to who can actually claim the title of the very first) to produce a self-winding chronograph movement in 1969. Although the Zenith Caliber 400 was a fantastic self-winding chronograph movement, Rolex did heavily modify it according to the needs of the Daytona. After all was said and done, only about 50% of the original base remained. Some of the most noteworthy modifications included reducing the frequency rate from 36,000 beats per hour to 28,800bph, removing the date function, and adding a new escapement with a Breguet overcoil. The Caliber 4030 uses a lateral clutch chronograph system and has a 54-hour power reserve. Zenith Daytona watches have five-digit reference numbers (165xx) and were produced from 1988 until 2000. It took Rolex five years to develop the in-house Caliber 4130, which made its debut in 2000 inside the new generation Daytona watches with six-digit reference numbers (1165xx). Compared to the 4030, the Caliber 4130 provided great improvements in terms of performance, power reserve, and serviceability. First of all, in direct contrast to its predecessor, Caliber 4130 uses a vertical clutch chronograph system. This system not only permits the chronograph to run for long periods with no influence on the watch\u2019s timekeeping accuracy, but it also eliminates the jitteriness of the chronograph hand when it starts/stops/resets. Rolex also increased the size of the mainspring barrel inside the 4130 to supply an increased 72-hour power reserve. Additionally, Rolex reduced the number of parts inside the movement to facilitate servicing. Almost two decades after it was first released, the in-house Rolex Caliber 4130 still stands as one of the best self-winding chronograph movements ever made. As chronographs, both the Caliber 4030 and the Caliber 4130 Daytona models have a trio of subsidiary dials on the dial in the familiar 3, 6, and 9 o\u2019clock layout. However, looks-wise, the order of the sub-dials is what distinguishes the Zenith Daytona from the in-house Daytona. On the Zenith Daytona watches, the 30-minute counter is located at 3 o\u2019clock, the 12-hour counter is located at 6 o\u2019clock, and the running seconds is located at 9 o\u2019clock. On the in-house Caliber 4130 Daytona watches, the running seconds is located at 6 o\u2019clock and the 12-hour counter is located at 9 o\u2019clock \u2013 those two sub-dials switched positions while the 30-minute counter remained in its original location. So the quickest way to spot a Zenith movement inside a Rolex Daytona by looking at the dial is checking to see if the running seconds is indeed at 9 o\u2019clock. The Zenith Daytona watches also have slimmer hour markers than their successors, and the placement of the three registers is more centered compared to the slightly off-centered placement of the later Daytona ref. 116xx models. Finally, the sub-dial rings on the stainless steel Zenith Daytona ref. 16520 are black on the white dial versions and off-white on the black dial versions while silver rings are used on the subsequent stainless steel Daytona ref. 116520. There you have it, a simple way to distinguish the early Zenith Daytona watches from the later in-house movement-powered Daytona watches without having to open up any casebacks!

With that said, they have not been powered by the same caliber. In this article, we\u2019ll look at the Rolex chronographs (pre-Daytona) and the different Daytona generations, and which movements they used. Which movement does the Daytona have? The predecessor to the Rolex Daytona was released in 1955 and has the reference 6234. This reference was not labeled nor named Daytona, but the model does share a lot of similar design traits as the current Daytona. You may say that this is the seed to the Daytona we have today. The reference was discontinued in 1961. This model wasn\u2019t very successful and relatively few pieces were made (about 500). However, it was the beginning of the legendary Daytona that we have today. The Rolex Chronograph reference 6234 is equipped with the Rolex Caliber 72. This is a manual mechanical movement with 17 jewels, a column-wheel construction, and a horizontal clutch. The movement is actually a Valjoux base. In 1965, Rolex released the chronograph reference 6240. This was the first chronograph from Rolex to use screw-in push buttons. The screw-down pushers keep dust and water from entering the case. This reference was produced from 1965 to 1969. Rolex made it as an experimental model. The Rolex 6240 uses a modified Valjoux movement, of which Rolex increased the frequency from 18,000 to 21,600 VPH. For this reference, Rolex used three calibers \u2013 the calibers 72B, 722, and 722-1. The caliber 72B was only used in 1965, the caliber 722 was used between about 1965 to 1968, and the caliber 722-1 was used approximately during the 2 last years of production. Rolex released the watch that is today known as the \u201dZenith Daytona\u201d in 1988. The name gives it away, but the reason it is called \u201dZenith Daytona\u201d is due to the fact that it uses a Zenith movement. In this reference, Rolex used a self-winding chronograph caliber, based Zenith\u2019s El Primero movement which was released in 1969. The Zenith movement was heavily modified by Rolex, including reducing the frequency from 36,000 to 28,800 VPH. Reducing the frequency meant upping the power reserve and reducing the wear and friction of the movement, which leads to longer service intervals. Since Rolex did such heavy modifications on this caliber, and to make it appear as an in-house Rolex movement, Rolex named the caliber 4030. In the year 2000, Rolex released its first fully in-house movement for the Daytona. This movement was presented in the new reference 116520 (including gold variants). The caliber was named 4130, which is a natural name change from the 4030 to highlight that it is a new-generation movement. The caliber 4130 has a 72-hour power reserve, 44 jewels, vertical coupling, column wheel, and Kif shock absorbers for the balance and escape wheel. The new ceramic Daytona reference 116500LN was released in 2016 and is equipped with the same caliber as the previous generation Daytona. Rolex did simply not see a reason to upgrade or change the Daytona caliber 4130 just yet, and so continued on a winning concept. As you can see, the Rolex Daytona (and its predecessors, pre-Daytona) have used a number of different calibers. The majority of these have been externally sourced movements, but the Rolex Daytona received a huge update when Rolex announced its first in-house chronograph movement 4130. This caliber is still used today, 20 years later, which goes to show that Rolex is perfectly satisfied with how the caliber performs and sees no reason to update it just yet. Bear in mind that we have only listed the stainless steel Daytona variant under each title. Many of the Daytona generations were also made in gold and gold & steel variants.

What some collectors might not realize is that Rolex's now-standard 'Perpetual' movement did not always power the famed chronograph. In fact, early Rolex Daytona references relied on Valjoux-based, manually-wound movements, and the collection's first self-winding caliber was based on a design from Zenith, rather than being one of Rolex's own creations. It was actually not until the current generation of Daytona watches that the brand's legendary chronograph finally received a fully in-house movement. The Daytona was not Rolex's first attempt at producing chronograph watches. The brand began selling them decades prior in the late 1930s with watches such as the ref. 2303. It featured two chronograph registers on the dial and a single pusher, which was built into the crown. Several variations of the pre-Daytona chronograph would follow, many of which varied in case size and general design. The Daytona, as we know it today, didn't start to take shape until the release of reference 6238 in 1960. It was powered by the Valjoux 72 B (then later the 722 from about 1965 onwards) and featured the Daytona's signature triple registers on the dial. However, while the ref. 6238 more-or-less resembled a Rolex Daytona, one crucial detail was missing. Its tachymeter scale was printed along the periphery of its dial, rather than on its bezel. It was not until the release of the ref. 6239 in 1963 that the Daytona's tachymeter scale moved to its bezel, and the watch took the form of the Daytona that we all know today. Like its pre-Daytona predecessor, the ref. 6239 was powered by a similar Valjoux 72B movement, which was later replaced by the Valjoux 722. Initially, the watch only featured the distinction \"Cosmograph\" on its dial; the 'Daytona' name didn't start to appear until the mid-1960s - a change that was made to celebrate the brand's status as the official timekeeper of the Daytona Speedway. Although a number of other Rolex Daytona references followed, the Daytona remained a manual-wind chronograph until 1988. During this time, the movement evolved and included the Valjoux 72, 722B, 722/1, and 727 - the last of which upgraded the Daytona to a higher frequency of 21,600bph, improving its overall accuracy. Despite incremental updates, it was not until the 1988 release of the next generation of Daytona watches that Rolex's chronograph finally received an automatic movement. During the 1970s and 1980s, the fact that a manual-wind movement powered the Rolex Daytona during an era in which quartz movements were starting to dominate the market somewhat deterred its success. It wasn't until the release of ref. 16520 in 1988 that the Daytona started to become more widely sought-after among the general public. While this edition was the first Rolex Daytona to run on a self-winding movement, it was based on the Zenith \"El Primero\" chronograph caliber that was then modified by Rolex. The Zenith movement was significantly modified in-house with over half the components swapped out to remove the date complication and lower the frequency to a slower rate of 28,800bph to achieve a longer power reserve. The result was the Cal. 4030, which remained in production until it was finally replaced by Rolex's first in-house chronograph movement in 2000 with the 6-digit reference Daytona watches. This generation of 'Zenith Daytona' watches were the first to feature an increased case size of 40mm and also the first to have a case with crown-guards. Additionally, this generation also introduced lacquered dials and scratch-resistant sapphire crystals to the Rolex Daytona collection, giving this generation a noticeably more contemporary look and feel than its Valjoux-based predecessors. With the 6-digit reference generation of Daytona watches came a self-winding movement that was developed entirely in-house by Rolex: the Caliber 4130. The 44-jewel powerhouse boasted a longer 72-hour power reserve and higher resistance to shocks and magnetism due to the use of Rolex\u2019s proprietary Parachrom hairspring. The update in movement is evident on the dial with slight changes to the positioning of the chronograph registers. The small seconds counter (previously at the 9 o'clock position) swapped places with the 12-hour counter, which sat at the 6 o'clock location on the Zenith movement models. The cal. 4130 remains Rolex's go-to chronograph movement for its incredibly smooth operation and accurate reading, and it is still used to power every modern Daytona watch that Rolex sells today. While the ref. 116520 made Rolex history as the first stainless\n\nquestion: What movement was heavily modified by Rolex to meet the needs of the Daytona?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "the Zenith \"El Primero\" chronograph caliber", "usage": 1120}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Evolution of the Rolex Daytona Movement\n\nevidence: Shop New Arrivals It is fair to say that much of the storied history of the Rolex Daytona really belongs to its movement. It was a change in caliber that took the watch from the brand\u2019s underperforming also-ran and transformed it into the hottest horological property of the last 30 years. A model Rolex could barely give away for the first quarter century of its production is now one so in demand that you have more chance of being struck by lightning on your way to buying a winning lottery ticket than picking one up new from your local authorized retailer. So how much difference can one movement have over another? Throughout its life, the Rolex Daytona has had three generations of movements \u2013 the manual-wind Valjoux calibers, followed by two automatic movements: one based on the Zenith El Primero, and most recently, one that is entirely of Rolex\u2019s own design: the Cal. 4130. It is these last movements that made the Daytona what it is today, both fantastically accomplished calibers with a host of differences. Below we take a look at both in a bit more detail. The battle to create the world\u2019s first automatically-winding mechanical chronograph movement ended in a sort of three-way tie in 1969. The competitors \u2013 Seiko in Japan and two Swiss entrants: Zenith (teaming up with fellow countrymen Movado) and a consortium called the Chronomatic Group (consisting of Heuer, Breitling, Hamilton-Buren, and Dubois Depraz) all released their own takes on the challenge that year. Zenith were the first to announce their caliber (the El Primero) in January, but it didn\u2019t actually become available until the following September. Seiko won the race to market, their 6139 launching in May, but with a frequency of 21,600vph, it was outperformed by the Zenith, which famously beat at 36,000vph and was able to measure time down to 1/10th second. The Caliber 11 from the Chronomatic Group also surfaced earlier, released in August, but it was an already existing movement with a chrono module retrofitted to it and experienced a number of problems from the outset. In terms of the overall winner in a closely-run race, most experts give the title to Zenith. Unfortunately, the self-winding chronograph movement was perfected just in time to coincide with the quartz crisis, which bankrupted nearly two-thirds of Switzerland\u2019s traditional brands. Zenith themselves came within a whisker of it, eventually being bought out by the Chicago-based Zenith Radio Corporation (no relation) in 1971. That could well have been the end for the El Primero (and possibly the Rolex Daytona too), but by the end of the decade the world had started to grow tired of the soullessness of electronics and were clamoring once again for the heritage and artistry of mechanical watches. Zenith was returned to Swiss hands in 1978 and were able to start production on the El Primero again almost immediately. (For a great story on just how they were able to do that, look up Charles Vermot and his heroic efforts; there\u2019s no room to go into it here sadly). The first big order came from Ebel in 1981, which poured much needed funds back into the manufacturer\u2019s business, and then in 1986, Rolex came knocking, signing a 10-year deal worth around seven million Swiss francs. Two years later, the second generation of the Rolex Daytona surfaced, powered by an automatic movement for the first time. The reason it took so long for the new Daytona to come out following the two companies forming an alliance is because Rolex\u2019s engineers gave the El Primero a severe going-over before fitting it inside the watch. Stripping the movement back to its mainplate, they made more than 200 separate modifications and left it with fewer than half its original components. The most significant were the removal of the date function and the fitting of an entirely new escapement, with a larger free sprung Glucydur balance wheel and Rolex\u2019s own Microstella regulating system. In addition, the flat hairspring was given a Breguet overcoil and the frequency was brought in line with the rest of the brand\u2019s lineup, dropping from 36,000vph to 28,800vph. The resulting movement was christened the Cal. 4030 and debuted inside the Rolex Daytona ref. 16520 in 1988. The ref. 165XX series of watches was the one to turn the Rolex Daytona into the legend it is today, revolutionizing the reputation of the much maligned watch practically overnight. However, as spectacular a success as it was, in Rolex\u2019s eyes it still had one fatal flaw.

After five years of development, the brand closed the loop and introduced the Cal. 4130 movement, the in-house engine that would drive the third generation of their chronograph. Outwardly, the new iteration of the Rolex Daytona was strikingly similar to the one it replaced, but inside, the movements were vastly different. Generally accepted as one of the finest mechanisms of its type ever made, the Cal. 4130 exemplifies Rolex\u2019s drive for efficiency, drawing the highest level of performance out of the smallest number of parts. In all, it is made up of just 201 components (20% fewer than the El Primero) making it just about the lowest of any modern chronograph movement. It has taken the sort of creative engineering for which Rolex is rightly famous. The minute and hour stopwatch functions, for example, which were controlled by two individual modules in Zenith\u2019s caliber, have been combined into a single unit on the Cal. 4130. That has freed up enough space for a larger mainspring, upping the power reserve from 50 to 72 hours. It also means that the chronograph module only needs one screw for its adjustment, as opposed to five on the previous movement. Other changes can be found on the self-winding system, which now uses ball bearings, making it 68% more efficient. The Cal. 4130 was also the movement chosen to debut Rolex\u2019s patented Parachrom hairspring, made from an antimagnetic alloy of niobium and zirconium which is impervious to temperature variations and offers up to 10 times the shock resistance compared to standard springs. In 2005 it was updated again, given a thicker oxide coating which caused it to change color when reacting with the air, and giving rise to its new name of the Blue Parachrom. But perhaps most importantly is the use of a vertical clutch. Where the El Primero employed a horizontal, or lateral, arrangement to control the chronograph, the Cal. 4130 has a pair of discs one on top of the other, running in constant synch with the drivetrain. Engaging and releasing the discs with the clutch eradicates the tiny jumps on the chrono hands during starts and stops, known as backlash. It not only means a more precise stopwatch, but also the chronograph can be run for longer periods of time without affecting the watch\u2019s overall timekeeping. While it undoubtedly improves upon the outgoing Zenith caliber, you will still find devotees who prefer the El Primero-powered models, which have a charm all their own. Those middle generation watches are also generally the most affordable entryway into Daytona ownership, particularly the two-tone steel and gold Rolesor examples. Rolex\u2019s racing legend has certainly come a long way from the early days of commercial failure, and it really has its movements to thank for much of its success. Perhaps the most important sports watch of them all, there is room for at least one Rolex Daytona in any watch collection. Subscribe today to receive email updates on our timepieces.

Gone were the Valjoux-based hand-wound movements inside of the Rolex Daytona in favor of Zenith El-Primero-based self-winding movements. The affectionately nicknamed \u2018Zenith Daytona\u2019 watches were around for 12 years until Rolex finally introduced a collection of automatic Daytona watches powered by their first in-house chronograph movement. At first glance, the two generations of the automatic Daytona look the same, both following similar design blueprints. Yet, upon closer inspection, the Daytona dial reveals which movement lies inside the watch \u2013 which is practical given that Rolex watches never come with a transparent exhibition caseback. If you\u2019re unsure how, read on to learn how to spot a Zenith movement inside a Rolex Daytona by looking at the dial. The first batch of automatic Daytona watches housed the Rolex Caliber 4030, which was based on the El-Primero Caliber 400 by Zenith. Caliber 400 was, in fact, a resurrection (brought back in 1985) of the pioneering Zenith El-Primero Cal. 3019PHC made from 1969-1975. You may recall that Zenith was one of the first watchmakers (it\u2019s an on-going debate in the watch world as to who can actually claim the title of the very first) to produce a self-winding chronograph movement in 1969. Although the Zenith Caliber 400 was a fantastic self-winding chronograph movement, Rolex did heavily modify it according to the needs of the Daytona. After all was said and done, only about 50% of the original base remained. Some of the most noteworthy modifications included reducing the frequency rate from 36,000 beats per hour to 28,800bph, removing the date function, and adding a new escapement with a Breguet overcoil. The Caliber 4030 uses a lateral clutch chronograph system and has a 54-hour power reserve. Zenith Daytona watches have five-digit reference numbers (165xx) and were produced from 1988 until 2000. It took Rolex five years to develop the in-house Caliber 4130, which made its debut in 2000 inside the new generation Daytona watches with six-digit reference numbers (1165xx). Compared to the 4030, the Caliber 4130 provided great improvements in terms of performance, power reserve, and serviceability. First of all, in direct contrast to its predecessor, Caliber 4130 uses a vertical clutch chronograph system. This system not only permits the chronograph to run for long periods with no influence on the watch\u2019s timekeeping accuracy, but it also eliminates the jitteriness of the chronograph hand when it starts/stops/resets. Rolex also increased the size of the mainspring barrel inside the 4130 to supply an increased 72-hour power reserve. Additionally, Rolex reduced the number of parts inside the movement to facilitate servicing. Almost two decades after it was first released, the in-house Rolex Caliber 4130 still stands as one of the best self-winding chronograph movements ever made. As chronographs, both the Caliber 4030 and the Caliber 4130 Daytona models have a trio of subsidiary dials on the dial in the familiar 3, 6, and 9 o\u2019clock layout. However, looks-wise, the order of the sub-dials is what distinguishes the Zenith Daytona from the in-house Daytona. On the Zenith Daytona watches, the 30-minute counter is located at 3 o\u2019clock, the 12-hour counter is located at 6 o\u2019clock, and the running seconds is located at 9 o\u2019clock. On the in-house Caliber 4130 Daytona watches, the running seconds is located at 6 o\u2019clock and the 12-hour counter is located at 9 o\u2019clock \u2013 those two sub-dials switched positions while the 30-minute counter remained in its original location. So the quickest way to spot a Zenith movement inside a Rolex Daytona by looking at the dial is checking to see if the running seconds is indeed at 9 o\u2019clock. The Zenith Daytona watches also have slimmer hour markers than their successors, and the placement of the three registers is more centered compared to the slightly off-centered placement of the later Daytona ref. 116xx models. Finally, the sub-dial rings on the stainless steel Zenith Daytona ref. 16520 are black on the white dial versions and off-white on the black dial versions while silver rings are used on the subsequent stainless steel Daytona ref. 116520. There you have it, a simple way to distinguish the early Zenith Daytona watches from the later in-house movement-powered Daytona watches without having to open up any casebacks!

With that said, they have not been powered by the same caliber. In this article, we\u2019ll look at the Rolex chronographs (pre-Daytona) and the different Daytona generations, and which movements they used. Which movement does the Daytona have? The predecessor to the Rolex Daytona was released in 1955 and has the reference 6234. This reference was not labeled nor named Daytona, but the model does share a lot of similar design traits as the current Daytona. You may say that this is the seed to the Daytona we have today. The reference was discontinued in 1961. This model wasn\u2019t very successful and relatively few pieces were made (about 500). However, it was the beginning of the legendary Daytona that we have today. The Rolex Chronograph reference 6234 is equipped with the Rolex Caliber 72. This is a manual mechanical movement with 17 jewels, a column-wheel construction, and a horizontal clutch. The movement is actually a Valjoux base. In 1965, Rolex released the chronograph reference 6240. This was the first chronograph from Rolex to use screw-in push buttons. The screw-down pushers keep dust and water from entering the case. This reference was produced from 1965 to 1969. Rolex made it as an experimental model. The Rolex 6240 uses a modified Valjoux movement, of which Rolex increased the frequency from 18,000 to 21,600 VPH. For this reference, Rolex used three calibers \u2013 the calibers 72B, 722, and 722-1. The caliber 72B was only used in 1965, the caliber 722 was used between about 1965 to 1968, and the caliber 722-1 was used approximately during the 2 last years of production. Rolex released the watch that is today known as the \u201dZenith Daytona\u201d in 1988. The name gives it away, but the reason it is called \u201dZenith Daytona\u201d is due to the fact that it uses a Zenith movement. In this reference, Rolex used a self-winding chronograph caliber, based Zenith\u2019s El Primero movement which was released in 1969. The Zenith movement was heavily modified by Rolex, including reducing the frequency from 36,000 to 28,800 VPH. Reducing the frequency meant upping the power reserve and reducing the wear and friction of the movement, which leads to longer service intervals. Since Rolex did such heavy modifications on this caliber, and to make it appear as an in-house Rolex movement, Rolex named the caliber 4030. In the year 2000, Rolex released its first fully in-house movement for the Daytona. This movement was presented in the new reference 116520 (including gold variants). The caliber was named 4130, which is a natural name change from the 4030 to highlight that it is a new-generation movement. The caliber 4130 has a 72-hour power reserve, 44 jewels, vertical coupling, column wheel, and Kif shock absorbers for the balance and escape wheel. The new ceramic Daytona reference 116500LN was released in 2016 and is equipped with the same caliber as the previous generation Daytona. Rolex did simply not see a reason to upgrade or change the Daytona caliber 4130 just yet, and so continued on a winning concept. As you can see, the Rolex Daytona (and its predecessors, pre-Daytona) have used a number of different calibers. The majority of these have been externally sourced movements, but the Rolex Daytona received a huge update when Rolex announced its first in-house chronograph movement 4130. This caliber is still used today, 20 years later, which goes to show that Rolex is perfectly satisfied with how the caliber performs and sees no reason to update it just yet. Bear in mind that we have only listed the stainless steel Daytona variant under each title. Many of the Daytona generations were also made in gold and gold & steel variants.

What some collectors might not realize is that Rolex's now-standard 'Perpetual' movement did not always power the famed chronograph. In fact, early Rolex Daytona references relied on Valjoux-based, manually-wound movements, and the collection's first self-winding caliber was based on a design from Zenith, rather than being one of Rolex's own creations. It was actually not until the current generation of Daytona watches that the brand's legendary chronograph finally received a fully in-house movement. The Daytona was not Rolex's first attempt at producing chronograph watches. The brand began selling them decades prior in the late 1930s with watches such as the ref. 2303. It featured two chronograph registers on the dial and a single pusher, which was built into the crown. Several variations of the pre-Daytona chronograph would follow, many of which varied in case size and general design. The Daytona, as we know it today, didn't start to take shape until the release of reference 6238 in 1960. It was powered by the Valjoux 72 B (then later the 722 from about 1965 onwards) and featured the Daytona's signature triple registers on the dial. However, while the ref. 6238 more-or-less resembled a Rolex Daytona, one crucial detail was missing. Its tachymeter scale was printed along the periphery of its dial, rather than on its bezel. It was not until the release of the ref. 6239 in 1963 that the Daytona's tachymeter scale moved to its bezel, and the watch took the form of the Daytona that we all know today. Like its pre-Daytona predecessor, the ref. 6239 was powered by a similar Valjoux 72B movement, which was later replaced by the Valjoux 722. Initially, the watch only featured the distinction \"Cosmograph\" on its dial; the 'Daytona' name didn't start to appear until the mid-1960s - a change that was made to celebrate the brand's status as the official timekeeper of the Daytona Speedway. Although a number of other Rolex Daytona references followed, the Daytona remained a manual-wind chronograph until 1988. During this time, the movement evolved and included the Valjoux 72, 722B, 722/1, and 727 - the last of which upgraded the Daytona to a higher frequency of 21,600bph, improving its overall accuracy. Despite incremental updates, it was not until the 1988 release of the next generation of Daytona watches that Rolex's chronograph finally received an automatic movement. During the 1970s and 1980s, the fact that a manual-wind movement powered the Rolex Daytona during an era in which quartz movements were starting to dominate the market somewhat deterred its success. It wasn't until the release of ref. 16520 in 1988 that the Daytona started to become more widely sought-after among the general public. While this edition was the first Rolex Daytona to run on a self-winding movement, it was based on the Zenith \"El Primero\" chronograph caliber that was then modified by Rolex. The Zenith movement was significantly modified in-house with over half the components swapped out to remove the date complication and lower the frequency to a slower rate of 28,800bph to achieve a longer power reserve. The result was the Cal. 4030, which remained in production until it was finally replaced by Rolex's first in-house chronograph movement in 2000 with the 6-digit reference Daytona watches. This generation of 'Zenith Daytona' watches were the first to feature an increased case size of 40mm and also the first to have a case with crown-guards. Additionally, this generation also introduced lacquered dials and scratch-resistant sapphire crystals to the Rolex Daytona collection, giving this generation a noticeably more contemporary look and feel than its Valjoux-based predecessors. With the 6-digit reference generation of Daytona watches came a self-winding movement that was developed entirely in-house by Rolex: the Caliber 4130. The 44-jewel powerhouse boasted a longer 72-hour power reserve and higher resistance to shocks and magnetism due to the use of Rolex\u2019s proprietary Parachrom hairspring. The update in movement is evident on the dial with slight changes to the positioning of the chronograph registers. The small seconds counter (previously at the 9 o'clock position) swapped places with the 12-hour counter, which sat at the 6 o'clock location on the Zenith movement models. The cal. 4130 remains Rolex's go-to chronograph movement for its incredibly smooth operation and accurate reading, and it is still used to power every modern Daytona watch that Rolex sells today. While the ref. 116520 made Rolex history as the first stainless\n\nquestion: When did Rolex introduce their first in-house chronograph movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "2000", "usage": 1108}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Between all of the different dial variations and noteworthy owners, the Rolex Daytona's history is far too long and complex to discuss in full detail in just one article. However, this brief history of the evolution of the chronograph's movement serves to shed more light on the Daytona's intriguing evolution, and perhaps create a greater appreciation for its diverse collection of references. 1900 Quail St. Newport Beach, CA 92660 MON - FRI 9AM - 5PM (PST) 380 10th St. S Naples, FL 34102 MON - FRI 9AM - 5PM (EST) Subscribe today to receive email updates on our timepieces.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Evolution of the Rolex Daytona Movement\n\nevidence: Shop New Arrivals It is fair to say that much of the storied history of the Rolex Daytona really belongs to its movement. It was a change in caliber that took the watch from the brand\u2019s underperforming also-ran and transformed it into the hottest horological property of the last 30 years. A model Rolex could barely give away for the first quarter century of its production is now one so in demand that you have more chance of being struck by lightning on your way to buying a winning lottery ticket than picking one up new from your local authorized retailer. So how much difference can one movement have over another? Throughout its life, the Rolex Daytona has had three generations of movements \u2013 the manual-wind Valjoux calibers, followed by two automatic movements: one based on the Zenith El Primero, and most recently, one that is entirely of Rolex\u2019s own design: the Cal. 4130. It is these last movements that made the Daytona what it is today, both fantastically accomplished calibers with a host of differences. Below we take a look at both in a bit more detail. The battle to create the world\u2019s first automatically-winding mechanical chronograph movement ended in a sort of three-way tie in 1969. The competitors \u2013 Seiko in Japan and two Swiss entrants: Zenith (teaming up with fellow countrymen Movado) and a consortium called the Chronomatic Group (consisting of Heuer, Breitling, Hamilton-Buren, and Dubois Depraz) all released their own takes on the challenge that year. Zenith were the first to announce their caliber (the El Primero) in January, but it didn\u2019t actually become available until the following September. Seiko won the race to market, their 6139 launching in May, but with a frequency of 21,600vph, it was outperformed by the Zenith, which famously beat at 36,000vph and was able to measure time down to 1/10th second. The Caliber 11 from the Chronomatic Group also surfaced earlier, released in August, but it was an already existing movement with a chrono module retrofitted to it and experienced a number of problems from the outset. In terms of the overall winner in a closely-run race, most experts give the title to Zenith. Unfortunately, the self-winding chronograph movement was perfected just in time to coincide with the quartz crisis, which bankrupted nearly two-thirds of Switzerland\u2019s traditional brands. Zenith themselves came within a whisker of it, eventually being bought out by the Chicago-based Zenith Radio Corporation (no relation) in 1971. That could well have been the end for the El Primero (and possibly the Rolex Daytona too), but by the end of the decade the world had started to grow tired of the soullessness of electronics and were clamoring once again for the heritage and artistry of mechanical watches. Zenith was returned to Swiss hands in 1978 and were able to start production on the El Primero again almost immediately. (For a great story on just how they were able to do that, look up Charles Vermot and his heroic efforts; there\u2019s no room to go into it here sadly). The first big order came from Ebel in 1981, which poured much needed funds back into the manufacturer\u2019s business, and then in 1986, Rolex came knocking, signing a 10-year deal worth around seven million Swiss francs. Two years later, the second generation of the Rolex Daytona surfaced, powered by an automatic movement for the first time. The reason it took so long for the new Daytona to come out following the two companies forming an alliance is because Rolex\u2019s engineers gave the El Primero a severe going-over before fitting it inside the watch. Stripping the movement back to its mainplate, they made more than 200 separate modifications and left it with fewer than half its original components. The most significant were the removal of the date function and the fitting of an entirely new escapement, with a larger free sprung Glucydur balance wheel and Rolex\u2019s own Microstella regulating system. In addition, the flat hairspring was given a Breguet overcoil and the frequency was brought in line with the rest of the brand\u2019s lineup, dropping from 36,000vph to 28,800vph. The resulting movement was christened the Cal. 4030 and debuted inside the Rolex Daytona ref. 16520 in 1988. The ref. 165XX series of watches was the one to turn the Rolex Daytona into the legend it is today, revolutionizing the reputation of the much maligned watch practically overnight. However, as spectacular a success as it was, in Rolex\u2019s eyes it still had one fatal flaw.

After five years of development, the brand closed the loop and introduced the Cal. 4130 movement, the in-house engine that would drive the third generation of their chronograph. Outwardly, the new iteration of the Rolex Daytona was strikingly similar to the one it replaced, but inside, the movements were vastly different. Generally accepted as one of the finest mechanisms of its type ever made, the Cal. 4130 exemplifies Rolex\u2019s drive for efficiency, drawing the highest level of performance out of the smallest number of parts. In all, it is made up of just 201 components (20% fewer than the El Primero) making it just about the lowest of any modern chronograph movement. It has taken the sort of creative engineering for which Rolex is rightly famous. The minute and hour stopwatch functions, for example, which were controlled by two individual modules in Zenith\u2019s caliber, have been combined into a single unit on the Cal. 4130. That has freed up enough space for a larger mainspring, upping the power reserve from 50 to 72 hours. It also means that the chronograph module only needs one screw for its adjustment, as opposed to five on the previous movement. Other changes can be found on the self-winding system, which now uses ball bearings, making it 68% more efficient. The Cal. 4130 was also the movement chosen to debut Rolex\u2019s patented Parachrom hairspring, made from an antimagnetic alloy of niobium and zirconium which is impervious to temperature variations and offers up to 10 times the shock resistance compared to standard springs. In 2005 it was updated again, given a thicker oxide coating which caused it to change color when reacting with the air, and giving rise to its new name of the Blue Parachrom. But perhaps most importantly is the use of a vertical clutch. Where the El Primero employed a horizontal, or lateral, arrangement to control the chronograph, the Cal. 4130 has a pair of discs one on top of the other, running in constant synch with the drivetrain. Engaging and releasing the discs with the clutch eradicates the tiny jumps on the chrono hands during starts and stops, known as backlash. It not only means a more precise stopwatch, but also the chronograph can be run for longer periods of time without affecting the watch\u2019s overall timekeeping. While it undoubtedly improves upon the outgoing Zenith caliber, you will still find devotees who prefer the El Primero-powered models, which have a charm all their own. Those middle generation watches are also generally the most affordable entryway into Daytona ownership, particularly the two-tone steel and gold Rolesor examples. Rolex\u2019s racing legend has certainly come a long way from the early days of commercial failure, and it really has its movements to thank for much of its success. Perhaps the most important sports watch of them all, there is room for at least one Rolex Daytona in any watch collection. Subscribe today to receive email updates on our timepieces.

Gone were the Valjoux-based hand-wound movements inside of the Rolex Daytona in favor of Zenith El-Primero-based self-winding movements. The affectionately nicknamed \u2018Zenith Daytona\u2019 watches were around for 12 years until Rolex finally introduced a collection of automatic Daytona watches powered by their first in-house chronograph movement. At first glance, the two generations of the automatic Daytona look the same, both following similar design blueprints. Yet, upon closer inspection, the Daytona dial reveals which movement lies inside the watch \u2013 which is practical given that Rolex watches never come with a transparent exhibition caseback. If you\u2019re unsure how, read on to learn how to spot a Zenith movement inside a Rolex Daytona by looking at the dial. The first batch of automatic Daytona watches housed the Rolex Caliber 4030, which was based on the El-Primero Caliber 400 by Zenith. Caliber 400 was, in fact, a resurrection (brought back in 1985) of the pioneering Zenith El-Primero Cal. 3019PHC made from 1969-1975. You may recall that Zenith was one of the first watchmakers (it\u2019s an on-going debate in the watch world as to who can actually claim the title of the very first) to produce a self-winding chronograph movement in 1969. Although the Zenith Caliber 400 was a fantastic self-winding chronograph movement, Rolex did heavily modify it according to the needs of the Daytona. After all was said and done, only about 50% of the original base remained. Some of the most noteworthy modifications included reducing the frequency rate from 36,000 beats per hour to 28,800bph, removing the date function, and adding a new escapement with a Breguet overcoil. The Caliber 4030 uses a lateral clutch chronograph system and has a 54-hour power reserve. Zenith Daytona watches have five-digit reference numbers (165xx) and were produced from 1988 until 2000. It took Rolex five years to develop the in-house Caliber 4130, which made its debut in 2000 inside the new generation Daytona watches with six-digit reference numbers (1165xx). Compared to the 4030, the Caliber 4130 provided great improvements in terms of performance, power reserve, and serviceability. First of all, in direct contrast to its predecessor, Caliber 4130 uses a vertical clutch chronograph system. This system not only permits the chronograph to run for long periods with no influence on the watch\u2019s timekeeping accuracy, but it also eliminates the jitteriness of the chronograph hand when it starts/stops/resets. Rolex also increased the size of the mainspring barrel inside the 4130 to supply an increased 72-hour power reserve. Additionally, Rolex reduced the number of parts inside the movement to facilitate servicing. Almost two decades after it was first released, the in-house Rolex Caliber 4130 still stands as one of the best self-winding chronograph movements ever made. As chronographs, both the Caliber 4030 and the Caliber 4130 Daytona models have a trio of subsidiary dials on the dial in the familiar 3, 6, and 9 o\u2019clock layout. However, looks-wise, the order of the sub-dials is what distinguishes the Zenith Daytona from the in-house Daytona. On the Zenith Daytona watches, the 30-minute counter is located at 3 o\u2019clock, the 12-hour counter is located at 6 o\u2019clock, and the running seconds is located at 9 o\u2019clock. On the in-house Caliber 4130 Daytona watches, the running seconds is located at 6 o\u2019clock and the 12-hour counter is located at 9 o\u2019clock \u2013 those two sub-dials switched positions while the 30-minute counter remained in its original location. So the quickest way to spot a Zenith movement inside a Rolex Daytona by looking at the dial is checking to see if the running seconds is indeed at 9 o\u2019clock. The Zenith Daytona watches also have slimmer hour markers than their successors, and the placement of the three registers is more centered compared to the slightly off-centered placement of the later Daytona ref. 116xx models. Finally, the sub-dial rings on the stainless steel Zenith Daytona ref. 16520 are black on the white dial versions and off-white on the black dial versions while silver rings are used on the subsequent stainless steel Daytona ref. 116520. There you have it, a simple way to distinguish the early Zenith Daytona watches from the later in-house movement-powered Daytona watches without having to open up any casebacks!

With that said, they have not been powered by the same caliber. In this article, we\u2019ll look at the Rolex chronographs (pre-Daytona) and the different Daytona generations, and which movements they used. Which movement does the Daytona have? The predecessor to the Rolex Daytona was released in 1955 and has the reference 6234. This reference was not labeled nor named Daytona, but the model does share a lot of similar design traits as the current Daytona. You may say that this is the seed to the Daytona we have today. The reference was discontinued in 1961. This model wasn\u2019t very successful and relatively few pieces were made (about 500). However, it was the beginning of the legendary Daytona that we have today. The Rolex Chronograph reference 6234 is equipped with the Rolex Caliber 72. This is a manual mechanical movement with 17 jewels, a column-wheel construction, and a horizontal clutch. The movement is actually a Valjoux base. In 1965, Rolex released the chronograph reference 6240. This was the first chronograph from Rolex to use screw-in push buttons. The screw-down pushers keep dust and water from entering the case. This reference was produced from 1965 to 1969. Rolex made it as an experimental model. The Rolex 6240 uses a modified Valjoux movement, of which Rolex increased the frequency from 18,000 to 21,600 VPH. For this reference, Rolex used three calibers \u2013 the calibers 72B, 722, and 722-1. The caliber 72B was only used in 1965, the caliber 722 was used between about 1965 to 1968, and the caliber 722-1 was used approximately during the 2 last years of production. Rolex released the watch that is today known as the \u201dZenith Daytona\u201d in 1988. The name gives it away, but the reason it is called \u201dZenith Daytona\u201d is due to the fact that it uses a Zenith movement. In this reference, Rolex used a self-winding chronograph caliber, based Zenith\u2019s El Primero movement which was released in 1969. The Zenith movement was heavily modified by Rolex, including reducing the frequency from 36,000 to 28,800 VPH. Reducing the frequency meant upping the power reserve and reducing the wear and friction of the movement, which leads to longer service intervals. Since Rolex did such heavy modifications on this caliber, and to make it appear as an in-house Rolex movement, Rolex named the caliber 4030. In the year 2000, Rolex released its first fully in-house movement for the Daytona. This movement was presented in the new reference 116520 (including gold variants). The caliber was named 4130, which is a natural name change from the 4030 to highlight that it is a new-generation movement. The caliber 4130 has a 72-hour power reserve, 44 jewels, vertical coupling, column wheel, and Kif shock absorbers for the balance and escape wheel. The new ceramic Daytona reference 116500LN was released in 2016 and is equipped with the same caliber as the previous generation Daytona. Rolex did simply not see a reason to upgrade or change the Daytona caliber 4130 just yet, and so continued on a winning concept. As you can see, the Rolex Daytona (and its predecessors, pre-Daytona) have used a number of different calibers. The majority of these have been externally sourced movements, but the Rolex Daytona received a huge update when Rolex announced its first in-house chronograph movement 4130. This caliber is still used today, 20 years later, which goes to show that Rolex is perfectly satisfied with how the caliber performs and sees no reason to update it just yet. Bear in mind that we have only listed the stainless steel Daytona variant under each title. Many of the Daytona generations were also made in gold and gold & steel variants.

What some collectors might not realize is that Rolex's now-standard 'Perpetual' movement did not always power the famed chronograph. In fact, early Rolex Daytona references relied on Valjoux-based, manually-wound movements, and the collection's first self-winding caliber was based on a design from Zenith, rather than being one of Rolex's own creations. It was actually not until the current generation of Daytona watches that the brand's legendary chronograph finally received a fully in-house movement. The Daytona was not Rolex's first attempt at producing chronograph watches. The brand began selling them decades prior in the late 1930s with watches such as the ref. 2303. It featured two chronograph registers on the dial and a single pusher, which was built into the crown. Several variations of the pre-Daytona chronograph would follow, many of which varied in case size and general design. The Daytona, as we know it today, didn't start to take shape until the release of reference 6238 in 1960. It was powered by the Valjoux 72 B (then later the 722 from about 1965 onwards) and featured the Daytona's signature triple registers on the dial. However, while the ref. 6238 more-or-less resembled a Rolex Daytona, one crucial detail was missing. Its tachymeter scale was printed along the periphery of its dial, rather than on its bezel. It was not until the release of the ref. 6239 in 1963 that the Daytona's tachymeter scale moved to its bezel, and the watch took the form of the Daytona that we all know today. Like its pre-Daytona predecessor, the ref. 6239 was powered by a similar Valjoux 72B movement, which was later replaced by the Valjoux 722. Initially, the watch only featured the distinction \"Cosmograph\" on its dial; the 'Daytona' name didn't start to appear until the mid-1960s - a change that was made to celebrate the brand's status as the official timekeeper of the Daytona Speedway. Although a number of other Rolex Daytona references followed, the Daytona remained a manual-wind chronograph until 1988. During this time, the movement evolved and included the Valjoux 72, 722B, 722/1, and 727 - the last of which upgraded the Daytona to a higher frequency of 21,600bph, improving its overall accuracy. Despite incremental updates, it was not until the 1988 release of the next generation of Daytona watches that Rolex's chronograph finally received an automatic movement. During the 1970s and 1980s, the fact that a manual-wind movement powered the Rolex Daytona during an era in which quartz movements were starting to dominate the market somewhat deterred its success. It wasn't until the release of ref. 16520 in 1988 that the Daytona started to become more widely sought-after among the general public. While this edition was the first Rolex Daytona to run on a self-winding movement, it was based on the Zenith \"El Primero\" chronograph caliber that was then modified by Rolex. The Zenith movement was significantly modified in-house with over half the components swapped out to remove the date complication and lower the frequency to a slower rate of 28,800bph to achieve a longer power reserve. The result was the Cal. 4030, which remained in production until it was finally replaced by Rolex's first in-house chronograph movement in 2000 with the 6-digit reference Daytona watches. This generation of 'Zenith Daytona' watches were the first to feature an increased case size of 40mm and also the first to have a case with crown-guards. Additionally, this generation also introduced lacquered dials and scratch-resistant sapphire crystals to the Rolex Daytona collection, giving this generation a noticeably more contemporary look and feel than its Valjoux-based predecessors. With the 6-digit reference generation of Daytona watches came a self-winding movement that was developed entirely in-house by Rolex: the Caliber 4130. The 44-jewel powerhouse boasted a longer 72-hour power reserve and higher resistance to shocks and magnetism due to the use of Rolex\u2019s proprietary Parachrom hairspring. The update in movement is evident on the dial with slight changes to the positioning of the chronograph registers. The small seconds counter (previously at the 9 o'clock position) swapped places with the 12-hour counter, which sat at the 6 o'clock location on the Zenith movement models. The cal. 4130 remains Rolex's go-to chronograph movement for its incredibly smooth operation and accurate reading, and it is still used to power every modern Daytona watch that Rolex sells today. While the ref. 116520 made Rolex history as the first stainless\n\nquestion: What movement has been used in the Daytona watches since 2000?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Rolex's Caliber 4130.", "usage": 1117}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Evolution of the Rolex Daytona Movement\n\nevidence: Shop New Arrivals It is fair to say that much of the storied history of the Rolex Daytona really belongs to its movement. It was a change in caliber that took the watch from the brand\u2019s underperforming also-ran and transformed it into the hottest horological property of the last 30 years. A model Rolex could barely give away for the first quarter century of its production is now one so in demand that you have more chance of being struck by lightning on your way to buying a winning lottery ticket than picking one up new from your local authorized retailer. So how much difference can one movement have over another? Throughout its life, the Rolex Daytona has had three generations of movements \u2013 the manual-wind Valjoux calibers, followed by two automatic movements: one based on the Zenith El Primero, and most recently, one that is entirely of Rolex\u2019s own design: the Cal. 4130. It is these last movements that made the Daytona what it is today, both fantastically accomplished calibers with a host of differences. Below we take a look at both in a bit more detail. The battle to create the world\u2019s first automatically-winding mechanical chronograph movement ended in a sort of three-way tie in 1969. The competitors \u2013 Seiko in Japan and two Swiss entrants: Zenith (teaming up with fellow countrymen Movado) and a consortium called the Chronomatic Group (consisting of Heuer, Breitling, Hamilton-Buren, and Dubois Depraz) all released their own takes on the challenge that year. Zenith were the first to announce their caliber (the El Primero) in January, but it didn\u2019t actually become available until the following September. Seiko won the race to market, their 6139 launching in May, but with a frequency of 21,600vph, it was outperformed by the Zenith, which famously beat at 36,000vph and was able to measure time down to 1/10th second. The Caliber 11 from the Chronomatic Group also surfaced earlier, released in August, but it was an already existing movement with a chrono module retrofitted to it and experienced a number of problems from the outset. In terms of the overall winner in a closely-run race, most experts give the title to Zenith. Unfortunately, the self-winding chronograph movement was perfected just in time to coincide with the quartz crisis, which bankrupted nearly two-thirds of Switzerland\u2019s traditional brands. Zenith themselves came within a whisker of it, eventually being bought out by the Chicago-based Zenith Radio Corporation (no relation) in 1971. That could well have been the end for the El Primero (and possibly the Rolex Daytona too), but by the end of the decade the world had started to grow tired of the soullessness of electronics and were clamoring once again for the heritage and artistry of mechanical watches. Zenith was returned to Swiss hands in 1978 and were able to start production on the El Primero again almost immediately. (For a great story on just how they were able to do that, look up Charles Vermot and his heroic efforts; there\u2019s no room to go into it here sadly). The first big order came from Ebel in 1981, which poured much needed funds back into the manufacturer\u2019s business, and then in 1986, Rolex came knocking, signing a 10-year deal worth around seven million Swiss francs. Two years later, the second generation of the Rolex Daytona surfaced, powered by an automatic movement for the first time. The reason it took so long for the new Daytona to come out following the two companies forming an alliance is because Rolex\u2019s engineers gave the El Primero a severe going-over before fitting it inside the watch. Stripping the movement back to its mainplate, they made more than 200 separate modifications and left it with fewer than half its original components. The most significant were the removal of the date function and the fitting of an entirely new escapement, with a larger free sprung Glucydur balance wheel and Rolex\u2019s own Microstella regulating system. In addition, the flat hairspring was given a Breguet overcoil and the frequency was brought in line with the rest of the brand\u2019s lineup, dropping from 36,000vph to 28,800vph. The resulting movement was christened the Cal. 4030 and debuted inside the Rolex Daytona ref. 16520 in 1988. The ref. 165XX series of watches was the one to turn the Rolex Daytona into the legend it is today, revolutionizing the reputation of the much maligned watch practically overnight. However, as spectacular a success as it was, in Rolex\u2019s eyes it still had one fatal flaw.

After five years of development, the brand closed the loop and introduced the Cal. 4130 movement, the in-house engine that would drive the third generation of their chronograph. Outwardly, the new iteration of the Rolex Daytona was strikingly similar to the one it replaced, but inside, the movements were vastly different. Generally accepted as one of the finest mechanisms of its type ever made, the Cal. 4130 exemplifies Rolex\u2019s drive for efficiency, drawing the highest level of performance out of the smallest number of parts. In all, it is made up of just 201 components (20% fewer than the El Primero) making it just about the lowest of any modern chronograph movement. It has taken the sort of creative engineering for which Rolex is rightly famous. The minute and hour stopwatch functions, for example, which were controlled by two individual modules in Zenith\u2019s caliber, have been combined into a single unit on the Cal. 4130. That has freed up enough space for a larger mainspring, upping the power reserve from 50 to 72 hours. It also means that the chronograph module only needs one screw for its adjustment, as opposed to five on the previous movement. Other changes can be found on the self-winding system, which now uses ball bearings, making it 68% more efficient. The Cal. 4130 was also the movement chosen to debut Rolex\u2019s patented Parachrom hairspring, made from an antimagnetic alloy of niobium and zirconium which is impervious to temperature variations and offers up to 10 times the shock resistance compared to standard springs. In 2005 it was updated again, given a thicker oxide coating which caused it to change color when reacting with the air, and giving rise to its new name of the Blue Parachrom. But perhaps most importantly is the use of a vertical clutch. Where the El Primero employed a horizontal, or lateral, arrangement to control the chronograph, the Cal. 4130 has a pair of discs one on top of the other, running in constant synch with the drivetrain. Engaging and releasing the discs with the clutch eradicates the tiny jumps on the chrono hands during starts and stops, known as backlash. It not only means a more precise stopwatch, but also the chronograph can be run for longer periods of time without affecting the watch\u2019s overall timekeeping. While it undoubtedly improves upon the outgoing Zenith caliber, you will still find devotees who prefer the El Primero-powered models, which have a charm all their own. Those middle generation watches are also generally the most affordable entryway into Daytona ownership, particularly the two-tone steel and gold Rolesor examples. Rolex\u2019s racing legend has certainly come a long way from the early days of commercial failure, and it really has its movements to thank for much of its success. Perhaps the most important sports watch of them all, there is room for at least one Rolex Daytona in any watch collection. Subscribe today to receive email updates on our timepieces.

Gone were the Valjoux-based hand-wound movements inside of the Rolex Daytona in favor of Zenith El-Primero-based self-winding movements. The affectionately nicknamed \u2018Zenith Daytona\u2019 watches were around for 12 years until Rolex finally introduced a collection of automatic Daytona watches powered by their first in-house chronograph movement. At first glance, the two generations of the automatic Daytona look the same, both following similar design blueprints. Yet, upon closer inspection, the Daytona dial reveals which movement lies inside the watch \u2013 which is practical given that Rolex watches never come with a transparent exhibition caseback. If you\u2019re unsure how, read on to learn how to spot a Zenith movement inside a Rolex Daytona by looking at the dial. The first batch of automatic Daytona watches housed the Rolex Caliber 4030, which was based on the El-Primero Caliber 400 by Zenith. Caliber 400 was, in fact, a resurrection (brought back in 1985) of the pioneering Zenith El-Primero Cal. 3019PHC made from 1969-1975. You may recall that Zenith was one of the first watchmakers (it\u2019s an on-going debate in the watch world as to who can actually claim the title of the very first) to produce a self-winding chronograph movement in 1969. Although the Zenith Caliber 400 was a fantastic self-winding chronograph movement, Rolex did heavily modify it according to the needs of the Daytona. After all was said and done, only about 50% of the original base remained. Some of the most noteworthy modifications included reducing the frequency rate from 36,000 beats per hour to 28,800bph, removing the date function, and adding a new escapement with a Breguet overcoil. The Caliber 4030 uses a lateral clutch chronograph system and has a 54-hour power reserve. Zenith Daytona watches have five-digit reference numbers (165xx) and were produced from 1988 until 2000. It took Rolex five years to develop the in-house Caliber 4130, which made its debut in 2000 inside the new generation Daytona watches with six-digit reference numbers (1165xx). Compared to the 4030, the Caliber 4130 provided great improvements in terms of performance, power reserve, and serviceability. First of all, in direct contrast to its predecessor, Caliber 4130 uses a vertical clutch chronograph system. This system not only permits the chronograph to run for long periods with no influence on the watch\u2019s timekeeping accuracy, but it also eliminates the jitteriness of the chronograph hand when it starts/stops/resets. Rolex also increased the size of the mainspring barrel inside the 4130 to supply an increased 72-hour power reserve. Additionally, Rolex reduced the number of parts inside the movement to facilitate servicing. Almost two decades after it was first released, the in-house Rolex Caliber 4130 still stands as one of the best self-winding chronograph movements ever made. As chronographs, both the Caliber 4030 and the Caliber 4130 Daytona models have a trio of subsidiary dials on the dial in the familiar 3, 6, and 9 o\u2019clock layout. However, looks-wise, the order of the sub-dials is what distinguishes the Zenith Daytona from the in-house Daytona. On the Zenith Daytona watches, the 30-minute counter is located at 3 o\u2019clock, the 12-hour counter is located at 6 o\u2019clock, and the running seconds is located at 9 o\u2019clock. On the in-house Caliber 4130 Daytona watches, the running seconds is located at 6 o\u2019clock and the 12-hour counter is located at 9 o\u2019clock \u2013 those two sub-dials switched positions while the 30-minute counter remained in its original location. So the quickest way to spot a Zenith movement inside a Rolex Daytona by looking at the dial is checking to see if the running seconds is indeed at 9 o\u2019clock. The Zenith Daytona watches also have slimmer hour markers than their successors, and the placement of the three registers is more centered compared to the slightly off-centered placement of the later Daytona ref. 116xx models. Finally, the sub-dial rings on the stainless steel Zenith Daytona ref. 16520 are black on the white dial versions and off-white on the black dial versions while silver rings are used on the subsequent stainless steel Daytona ref. 116520. There you have it, a simple way to distinguish the early Zenith Daytona watches from the later in-house movement-powered Daytona watches without having to open up any casebacks!

With that said, they have not been powered by the same caliber. In this article, we\u2019ll look at the Rolex chronographs (pre-Daytona) and the different Daytona generations, and which movements they used. Which movement does the Daytona have? The predecessor to the Rolex Daytona was released in 1955 and has the reference 6234. This reference was not labeled nor named Daytona, but the model does share a lot of similar design traits as the current Daytona. You may say that this is the seed to the Daytona we have today. The reference was discontinued in 1961. This model wasn\u2019t very successful and relatively few pieces were made (about 500). However, it was the beginning of the legendary Daytona that we have today. The Rolex Chronograph reference 6234 is equipped with the Rolex Caliber 72. This is a manual mechanical movement with 17 jewels, a column-wheel construction, and a horizontal clutch. The movement is actually a Valjoux base. In 1965, Rolex released the chronograph reference 6240. This was the first chronograph from Rolex to use screw-in push buttons. The screw-down pushers keep dust and water from entering the case. This reference was produced from 1965 to 1969. Rolex made it as an experimental model. The Rolex 6240 uses a modified Valjoux movement, of which Rolex increased the frequency from 18,000 to 21,600 VPH. For this reference, Rolex used three calibers \u2013 the calibers 72B, 722, and 722-1. The caliber 72B was only used in 1965, the caliber 722 was used between about 1965 to 1968, and the caliber 722-1 was used approximately during the 2 last years of production. Rolex released the watch that is today known as the \u201dZenith Daytona\u201d in 1988. The name gives it away, but the reason it is called \u201dZenith Daytona\u201d is due to the fact that it uses a Zenith movement. In this reference, Rolex used a self-winding chronograph caliber, based Zenith\u2019s El Primero movement which was released in 1969. The Zenith movement was heavily modified by Rolex, including reducing the frequency from 36,000 to 28,800 VPH. Reducing the frequency meant upping the power reserve and reducing the wear and friction of the movement, which leads to longer service intervals. Since Rolex did such heavy modifications on this caliber, and to make it appear as an in-house Rolex movement, Rolex named the caliber 4030. In the year 2000, Rolex released its first fully in-house movement for the Daytona. This movement was presented in the new reference 116520 (including gold variants). The caliber was named 4130, which is a natural name change from the 4030 to highlight that it is a new-generation movement. The caliber 4130 has a 72-hour power reserve, 44 jewels, vertical coupling, column wheel, and Kif shock absorbers for the balance and escape wheel. The new ceramic Daytona reference 116500LN was released in 2016 and is equipped with the same caliber as the previous generation Daytona. Rolex did simply not see a reason to upgrade or change the Daytona caliber 4130 just yet, and so continued on a winning concept. As you can see, the Rolex Daytona (and its predecessors, pre-Daytona) have used a number of different calibers. The majority of these have been externally sourced movements, but the Rolex Daytona received a huge update when Rolex announced its first in-house chronograph movement 4130. This caliber is still used today, 20 years later, which goes to show that Rolex is perfectly satisfied with how the caliber performs and sees no reason to update it just yet. Bear in mind that we have only listed the stainless steel Daytona variant under each title. Many of the Daytona generations were also made in gold and gold & steel variants.

What some collectors might not realize is that Rolex's now-standard 'Perpetual' movement did not always power the famed chronograph. In fact, early Rolex Daytona references relied on Valjoux-based, manually-wound movements, and the collection's first self-winding caliber was based on a design from Zenith, rather than being one of Rolex's own creations. It was actually not until the current generation of Daytona watches that the brand's legendary chronograph finally received a fully in-house movement. The Daytona was not Rolex's first attempt at producing chronograph watches. The brand began selling them decades prior in the late 1930s with watches such as the ref. 2303. It featured two chronograph registers on the dial and a single pusher, which was built into the crown. Several variations of the pre-Daytona chronograph would follow, many of which varied in case size and general design. The Daytona, as we know it today, didn't start to take shape until the release of reference 6238 in 1960. It was powered by the Valjoux 72 B (then later the 722 from about 1965 onwards) and featured the Daytona's signature triple registers on the dial. However, while the ref. 6238 more-or-less resembled a Rolex Daytona, one crucial detail was missing. Its tachymeter scale was printed along the periphery of its dial, rather than on its bezel. It was not until the release of the ref. 6239 in 1963 that the Daytona's tachymeter scale moved to its bezel, and the watch took the form of the Daytona that we all know today. Like its pre-Daytona predecessor, the ref. 6239 was powered by a similar Valjoux 72B movement, which was later replaced by the Valjoux 722. Initially, the watch only featured the distinction \"Cosmograph\" on its dial; the 'Daytona' name didn't start to appear until the mid-1960s - a change that was made to celebrate the brand's status as the official timekeeper of the Daytona Speedway. Although a number of other Rolex Daytona references followed, the Daytona remained a manual-wind chronograph until 1988. During this time, the movement evolved and included the Valjoux 72, 722B, 722/1, and 727 - the last of which upgraded the Daytona to a higher frequency of 21,600bph, improving its overall accuracy. Despite incremental updates, it was not until the 1988 release of the next generation of Daytona watches that Rolex's chronograph finally received an automatic movement. During the 1970s and 1980s, the fact that a manual-wind movement powered the Rolex Daytona during an era in which quartz movements were starting to dominate the market somewhat deterred its success. It wasn't until the release of ref. 16520 in 1988 that the Daytona started to become more widely sought-after among the general public. While this edition was the first Rolex Daytona to run on a self-winding movement, it was based on the Zenith \"El Primero\" chronograph caliber that was then modified by Rolex. The Zenith movement was significantly modified in-house with over half the components swapped out to remove the date complication and lower the frequency to a slower rate of 28,800bph to achieve a longer power reserve. The result was the Cal. 4030, which remained in production until it was finally replaced by Rolex's first in-house chronograph movement in 2000 with the 6-digit reference Daytona watches. This generation of 'Zenith Daytona' watches were the first to feature an increased case size of 40mm and also the first to have a case with crown-guards. Additionally, this generation also introduced lacquered dials and scratch-resistant sapphire crystals to the Rolex Daytona collection, giving this generation a noticeably more contemporary look and feel than its Valjoux-based predecessors. With the 6-digit reference generation of Daytona watches came a self-winding movement that was developed entirely in-house by Rolex: the Caliber 4130. The 44-jewel powerhouse boasted a longer 72-hour power reserve and higher resistance to shocks and magnetism due to the use of Rolex\u2019s proprietary Parachrom hairspring. The update in movement is evident on the dial with slight changes to the positioning of the chronograph registers. The small seconds counter (previously at the 9 o'clock position) swapped places with the 12-hour counter, which sat at the 6 o'clock location on the Zenith movement models. The cal. 4130 remains Rolex's go-to chronograph movement for its incredibly smooth operation and accurate reading, and it is still used to power every modern Daytona watch that Rolex sells today. While the ref. 116520 made Rolex history as the first stainless\n\nquestion: When did the Rolex Daytona stop using the Zenith movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "2000", "usage": 1108}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This widely coveted version of the Daytona features longer-lasting Chromalight lume on the dial, and a bezel crafted from Rolex\u2019s patented \"Cerachrom\u201d ceramic material. This edition of the Daytona marks the next phase in the model\u2019s evolution; however, the movement used to power it remains largely the same as the one that Rolex first debuted back in 2000. Between all of the different dial variations and noteworthy owners, the Rolex Daytona's history is far too long and complex to discuss in full detail in just one article. However, this brief history of the evolution of the chronograph's movement serves to shed more light on the Daytona's intriguing evolution, and perhaps create a greater appreciation for its diverse collection of references. 1900 Quail St. Newport Beach, CA 92660 MON - FRI 9AM - 5PM (PST) 380 10th St. S Naples, FL 34102 MON - FRI 9AM - 5PM (EST) Subscribe today to receive email updates on our timepieces.
