American group Heavy D & the Boyz released their very successful dance/house-cover of \"Now That We Found Love\" in 1991. It was produced by Teddy Riley and remains their biggest hit. The song was released in June as the second single from their third album, Peaceful Journey (1991), and peaked at number two in the UK and number 11 in the US. Its music video was directed by Drew Carolan. \"Now That We Found Love\" was very successful on the singles charts on several continents. In Europe, it reached number three in the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. In the latter, the single peaked in its fourth week at the UK Singles Chart, on July 21, 1991. It was held off the top spot by Bryan Adams' \"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\". On the UK Dance Singles Chart, it reached number four. Additionally, the single entered the top 10 also in Austria (8), Belgium (5), Denmark (3), Germany (4), Greece (5), Ireland (6), Norway (6), Spain (5) and Switzerland (4), as well as on the Eurochart Hot 100, where it peaked at number four in September 1991. Outside Europe, it peaked at number-one on the RPM Dance/Urban chart in Canada, number two on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart and number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US. In Oceania, \"Now That We Found Love\" was also a top 10 hit in Australia and New Zealand, peaking at number six and ten, respectively. \"Now That We Found Love\" was awarded with a gold record in the United States, with a sale of 500,000 singles. AllMusic editor Alex Henderson complimented the Heavy D & the Boyz version as \"melodic\", and \"fun and escapist in nature\". J.D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun wrote, \"If the Hevster can keep serving up singles as infectious as \"Now That We Found Love\", he'll get few complaints.\" Larry Flick from Billboard viewed it as a \"fab hip-house interpretation\" and \"an invigorating peak-hour anthem\". He also noted that the producer \"adds a mainstream gloss that could spark a top 40 breakthrough hit.\" Henderson and DeVancy for Cashbox stated that this is a song \"to look out for\". James Bernard from Entertainment Weekly called it a \"fast-paced hip-house jam\". Zane from Melody Maker wrote, \"Everything that made the original so special is lovingly reproduced with only a smattering of new noises and beats spun in. A perfect party tune.\" James Hamilton from Music Week named it Pick of the Week in the category of Dance, declaring it as a \"jaunty singalong stereo rap\". Eric Deggans from The Pittsburgh Press described it as \"reggae-flavored\". Martin Aston from the RM Dance Update felt that the track \"has been given a bouncy, slick gloss, with a typically snappy slice of rap from the heavyweight poet.\" Marc Andrews from Smash Hits complimented it as \"rap at its most jolly and fun-filled\". In an 2021 retrospective review, Jesse Ducker from Albumism described \"Now That We Found Love\" as \"a catchy and extremely successful pairing with producer Riley, featuring Aaron Hall\u2019s powerful vocals on the chorus. The song takes some of its inspiration from the O'Jays' song of the same name, but has the most in common with reggae group Third World\u2019s version of the track. Heavy D plays to his strengths here, celebrating the love he\u2019s cultivated and finding new ways to explore its dynamics.\" In 2017, BuzzFeed ranked it number 59 in their list of \"The 101 Greatest Dance Songs Of the '90s\". Australian music channel Max included it in their list of \"1000 Greatest Songs of All Time\" in 2013. The accompanying music video for \"Now That We Found Love\" was directed by Drew Carolan. It features Heavy D and dancers performing in an urban backstreet. The dancers are wearing yellow raincoats. At the beginning, as the singer performs, a woman glances through a blind in her window. Later she emerges on a balcony, watching the singer. Heavy D is mostly seen wearing a red jacket, but also occasionally wears a raincoat in various colors, such as black and green. Several guys on the street are playing games with cards or dices. A DJ plays with his turntable. Many people are dancing. Towards the end, the woman comes walking on the street, meeting Heavy D. Then the two are walking away together from the partying crowd on the street. The video was later published on Heavy D's official YouTube channel\n\nquestion: Who originally wrote the song 'Now That We Found Love'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff", "usage": 1124}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The Netherlands broadcaster AVRO aired the programme weekly, from 22 September 1970, to 27 June 1988. Presenter Ad Visser hosted for its first fifteen years. The creator and original director of TopPop was Rien van Wijk. Many other directors followed: Egbert van Hees, Geert Popma, Henk Renou, Chris Berger, Jessy Winkelman, Wim van der Linden, Bert van der Veer and Charly Noise. Although TopPop was inspired by British music programme Top of the Pops, it had its own character. The main approach was to let music artists mime to their latest hit record in the TopPop studio. However, most music acts in the Dutch pop charts were foreign to the Netherlands, and frequently not available for a performance in the studio. If this was the case, it was sometimes possible for the TopPop camera crew to meet the artist at another location. Consequently, artists were filmed around the world, including Tom Browne in a studio in New York City, David Cassidy at the airport in Schiphol, and Barry White at his home in Los Angeles. If there was no way to feature the artists on TopPop, their promo video would be played - if one existed, since prior to the 1980s these were not routinely created. If all else failed, there was a fourth option that the programme frequently had to resort to: hit songs were played to a dance routine by dancer and choreographer Penney de Jager and her troupe. When music videos became more common on television, the popularity of TopPop decreased and the programme was stopped in 1988. TopPop was chosen as the programme of the century in a poll in 2000 by Televizier. For many Dutch and Flemish viewers, TopPop was the primary source of information about pop music. TopPop compiled its own hit chart, based on viewers' top-ten lists, sent in on postcards, from 1970 to 1974, from 1978 to 1982 and from 23 February 1986 to 10 July 1988. However, it used the Dutch National Hitparade, a sales-based list, from 1974 to 1978 and from 1982 to 1986. In the last programme of each year, the annual complete Top 10 was broadcast. There were performances by studio guests, and there were polls among viewers on the most popular artist, group and DJ. Looking back on the year 1976, Ad Visser and Krijn Torringa were sitting behind a desk in an office which made it a parody of Van Oekel's Discohoek. This absurd programme was itself a parody of TopPop. Notable performances include one in 1977, by Iggy Pop, who refused to leave his dressing room and then, during a rehearsal, stormed dramatically and unexpectedly onto the studio floor. He spent most of the song writhing on the floor without a shirt on, miming his hit single and destroying some plants that had been put on the floor as decoration. For many young viewers in the Netherlands, this was their first encounter with punk rock. Some TopPop-made videos were of such quality, the performing artist chose to use it as their promotional video. Examples are the 1974 sequence of an eye-patched David Bowie miming to \"Rebel Rebel\", and Nena walking through a wood-cuttery at Crailoo near Hilversum, imagining a post-war devastated area fit for the Cold War atmosphere of her 1983 hit \"99 Red Balloons\".

Murray and her close friend Julia Turner opened the Medico-Psychological Clinic (site pictured) in 1913, a pioneering entity that provided psychological evaluation and treatment that was affordable for middle-class families. Several of the staff who worked and trained at the clinic became leading psychoanalysts. The clinic closed in 1922, although it laid the foundation of psychological evaluation in the UK. Murray was a member of the Women's Freedom League and the Women's Tax Resistance League, two organisations that took direct action for women's suffrage. In 1910 she and the journalist Henry Brailsford took statements from the suffragettes who had been mistreated during the Black Friday demonstrations. Their memorandum was published, with a formal request for a public inquiry. The home secretary, Winston Churchill, refused to establish one. (Full article...) November 15 Prehnite is an inosilicate mineral of calcium and aluminium with the chemical formula Ca2Al(AlSi3O10)(OH)2. Limited Fe3+ substitutes for aluminium in the structure. Prehnite crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system, and most often forms as stalactitic, botryoidal, reniform or globular aggregates. Prehnite is brittle with an uneven fracture and a vitreous to pearly luster. It has a hardness of 6.5 on the Mohs scale and its specific gravity is 2.80 to 2.95, while its color varies from light green to yellow, with some specimens also colorless. Prehnite is used as a gemstone, and was first described in 1788 for an occurrence in the Karoo dolerites of Cradock in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. It was named after Colonel Hendrik Von Prehn, the commander of the military forces of the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope from 1768 to 1780. This prehnite crystal, measuring 4.0 cm \u00d7 3.5 cm \u00d7 2.0 cm (1.6 in \u00d7 1.4 in \u00d7 0.8 in), was found in Southbury, Connecticut, in the United States.

Murray and her close friend Julia Turner opened the Medico-Psychological Clinic (site pictured) in 1913, a pioneering entity that provided psychological evaluation and treatment that was affordable for middle-class families. Several of the staff who worked and trained at the clinic became leading psychoanalysts. The clinic closed in 1922, although it laid the foundation of psychological evaluation in the UK. Murray was a member of the Women's Freedom League and the Women's Tax Resistance League, two organisations that took direct action for women's suffrage. In 1910 she and the journalist Henry Brailsford took statements from the suffragettes who had been mistreated during the Black Friday demonstrations. Their memorandum was published, with a formal request for a public inquiry. The home secretary, Winston Churchill, refused to establish one. (Full article...) November 15 Prehnite is an inosilicate mineral of calcium and aluminium with the chemical formula Ca2Al(AlSi3O10)(OH)2. Limited Fe3+ substitutes for aluminium in the structure. Prehnite crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system, and most often forms as stalactitic, botryoidal, reniform or globular aggregates. Prehnite is brittle with an uneven fracture and a vitreous to pearly luster. It has a hardness of 6.5 on the Mohs scale and its specific gravity is 2.80 to 2.95, while its color varies from light green to yellow, with some specimens also colorless. Prehnite is used as a gemstone, and was first described in 1788 for an occurrence in the Karoo dolerites of Cradock in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. It was named after Colonel Hendrik Von Prehn, the commander of the military forces of the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope from 1768 to 1780. This prehnite crystal, measuring 4.0 cm \u00d7 3.5 cm \u00d7 2.0 cm (1.6 in \u00d7 1.4 in \u00d7 0.8 in), was found in Southbury, Connecticut, in the United States.

American group Heavy D & the Boyz released their very successful dance/house-cover of \"Now That We Found Love\" in 1991. It was produced by Teddy Riley and remains their biggest hit. The song was released in June as the second single from their third album, Peaceful Journey (1991), and peaked at number two in the UK and number 11 in the US. Its music video was directed by Drew Carolan. \"Now That We Found Love\" was very successful on the singles charts on several continents. In Europe, it reached number three in the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. In the latter, the single peaked in its fourth week at the UK Singles Chart, on July 21, 1991. It was held off the top spot by Bryan Adams' \"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\". On the UK Dance Singles Chart, it reached number four. Additionally, the single entered the top 10 also in Austria (8), Belgium (5), Denmark (3), Germany (4), Greece (5), Ireland (6), Norway (6), Spain (5) and Switzerland (4), as well as on the Eurochart Hot 100, where it peaked at number four in September 1991. Outside Europe, it peaked at number-one on the RPM Dance/Urban chart in Canada, number two on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart and number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US. In Oceania, \"Now That We Found Love\" was also a top 10 hit in Australia and New Zealand, peaking at number six and ten, respectively. \"Now That We Found Love\" was awarded with a gold record in the United States, with a sale of 500,000 singles. AllMusic editor Alex Henderson complimented the Heavy D & the Boyz version as \"melodic\", and \"fun and escapist in nature\". J.D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun wrote, \"If the Hevster can keep serving up singles as infectious as \"Now That We Found Love\", he'll get few complaints.\" Larry Flick from Billboard viewed it as a \"fab hip-house interpretation\" and \"an invigorating peak-hour anthem\". He also noted that the producer \"adds a mainstream gloss that could spark a top 40 breakthrough hit.\" Henderson and DeVancy for Cashbox stated that this is a song \"to look out for\". James Bernard from Entertainment Weekly called it a \"fast-paced hip-house jam\". Zane from Melody Maker wrote, \"Everything that made the original so special is lovingly reproduced with only a smattering of new noises and beats spun in. A perfect party tune.\" James Hamilton from Music Week named it Pick of the Week in the category of Dance, declaring it as a \"jaunty singalong stereo rap\". Eric Deggans from The Pittsburgh Press described it as \"reggae-flavored\". Martin Aston from the RM Dance Update felt that the track \"has been given a bouncy, slick gloss, with a typically snappy slice of rap from the heavyweight poet.\" Marc Andrews from Smash Hits complimented it as \"rap at its most jolly and fun-filled\". In an 2021 retrospective review, Jesse Ducker from Albumism described \"Now That We Found Love\" as \"a catchy and extremely successful pairing with producer Riley, featuring Aaron Hall\u2019s powerful vocals on the chorus. The song takes some of its inspiration from the O'Jays' song of the same name, but has the most in common with reggae group Third World\u2019s version of the track. Heavy D plays to his strengths here, celebrating the love he\u2019s cultivated and finding new ways to explore its dynamics.\" In 2017, BuzzFeed ranked it number 59 in their list of \"The 101 Greatest Dance Songs Of the '90s\". Australian music channel Max included it in their list of \"1000 Greatest Songs of All Time\" in 2013. The accompanying music video for \"Now That We Found Love\" was directed by Drew Carolan. It features Heavy D and dancers performing in an urban backstreet. The dancers are wearing yellow raincoats. At the beginning, as the singer performs, a woman glances through a blind in her window. Later she emerges on a balcony, watching the singer. Heavy D is mostly seen wearing a red jacket, but also occasionally wears a raincoat in various colors, such as black and green. Several guys on the street are playing games with cards or dices. A DJ plays with his turntable. Many people are dancing. Towards the end, the woman comes walking on the street, meeting Heavy D. Then the two are walking away together from the partying crowd on the street. The video was later published on Heavy D's official YouTube channel\n\nquestion: Who covered the song in 1991, resulting in a very successful dance/house cover?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Heavy D and the Boyz", "usage": 1129}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The Netherlands broadcaster AVRO aired the programme weekly, from 22 September 1970, to 27 June 1988. Presenter Ad Visser hosted for its first fifteen years. The creator and original director of TopPop was Rien van Wijk. Many other directors followed: Egbert van Hees, Geert Popma, Henk Renou, Chris Berger, Jessy Winkelman, Wim van der Linden, Bert van der Veer and Charly Noise. Although TopPop was inspired by British music programme Top of the Pops, it had its own character. The main approach was to let music artists mime to their latest hit record in the TopPop studio. However, most music acts in the Dutch pop charts were foreign to the Netherlands, and frequently not available for a performance in the studio. If this was the case, it was sometimes possible for the TopPop camera crew to meet the artist at another location. Consequently, artists were filmed around the world, including Tom Browne in a studio in New York City, David Cassidy at the airport in Schiphol, and Barry White at his home in Los Angeles. If there was no way to feature the artists on TopPop, their promo video would be played - if one existed, since prior to the 1980s these were not routinely created. If all else failed, there was a fourth option that the programme frequently had to resort to: hit songs were played to a dance routine by dancer and choreographer Penney de Jager and her troupe. When music videos became more common on television, the popularity of TopPop decreased and the programme was stopped in 1988. TopPop was chosen as the programme of the century in a poll in 2000 by Televizier. For many Dutch and Flemish viewers, TopPop was the primary source of information about pop music. TopPop compiled its own hit chart, based on viewers' top-ten lists, sent in on postcards, from 1970 to 1974, from 1978 to 1982 and from 23 February 1986 to 10 July 1988. However, it used the Dutch National Hitparade, a sales-based list, from 1974 to 1978 and from 1982 to 1986. In the last programme of each year, the annual complete Top 10 was broadcast. There were performances by studio guests, and there were polls among viewers on the most popular artist, group and DJ. Looking back on the year 1976, Ad Visser and Krijn Torringa were sitting behind a desk in an office which made it a parody of Van Oekel's Discohoek. This absurd programme was itself a parody of TopPop. Notable performances include one in 1977, by Iggy Pop, who refused to leave his dressing room and then, during a rehearsal, stormed dramatically and unexpectedly onto the studio floor. He spent most of the song writhing on the floor without a shirt on, miming his hit single and destroying some plants that had been put on the floor as decoration. For many young viewers in the Netherlands, this was their first encounter with punk rock. Some TopPop-made videos were of such quality, the performing artist chose to use it as their promotional video. Examples are the 1974 sequence of an eye-patched David Bowie miming to \"Rebel Rebel\", and Nena walking through a wood-cuttery at Crailoo near Hilversum, imagining a post-war devastated area fit for the Cold War atmosphere of her 1983 hit \"99 Red Balloons\".
