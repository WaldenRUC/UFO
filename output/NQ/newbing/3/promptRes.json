The Awakening is an aluminum statue depicting a giant man desperately struggling to emerge from the earth. Made up of five parts, the giant\u2019s outstretched right arm towers 17 feet above the ground, and his bent left leg and knee rise above the earth, while his left hand and right foot just break the surface. His bearded face shows a look of abject terror with his mouth opening to unleash a primal scream. This striking work of art, created by John Seward Johnson II, was originally installed at Hains Point in Washington, D.C. in 1980, and was a jarring sight from above for visitors flying into National Airport from the south. The statue remained in place on the tip of Hains Point in East Potomac Park for 27 years. The statue was scheduled to be sold and sent to Japan, however, the developer of National Harbor Peterson Companies, purchased it and moved it to National Harbor, Maryland. The current location on the Potomac River, is just 15 miles from downtown Washington, D.C. The sculptor, J. Seward Johnson, is an American artist best known for his trompe l\u2019oeil painted bronze statues. He is a grandson of Robert Wood Johnson (the co-founder of Johnson & Johnson), and Colonel Thomas Melville Dill, a prominent Bermudian lawyer and soldier. Many of Seward\u2019s works are unassuming slices of life that might go unnoticed by passers-by, but this epic work is literally larger than life. In 2009, a copy of the statue (The Awakening II) was installed near Chesterfield Central Park in Chesterfield, Missouri in 2009. The sculpture is located on the small beach area at the Potomac waterfront in National Harbor. If you're looking for it specifically, it's impossible to miss, but part of the fun is watching the alarmed looks of those who are just stumbling upon it for the first time.

Seward Johnson, entitled The Awakening. After spending much of his early career as a painter, Johnson turned to sculpture and is now best known for his life-sized work that portrays ordinary people communicating very realistic human gestures. The Awakening, a 70 foot giant, is one of Johnson's most dramatic works. Back in 1980, it was selected for the International Sculpture Conference Exhibition in Washington, D.C., and was originally located at Hains Point. Each of five separate aluminum pieces is buried in the ground, giving the impression that the full body is hidden beneath the surface. The man's face, hands, and parts of the right foot and the left knee are the only pieces that are actually visible. Today, visitors can stop by the National Harbor to witness, first hand, the passionate energy that radiates from the installation of this distressed man, trying to break free from the earth. J.

The statue was scheduled to be sold and sent to Japan, however, the developer of National Harbor Peterson Companies, purchased it and moved it to National Harbor, Maryland. The current location on the Potomac River, is just 15 miles from downtown Washington, D.C. The sculptor, J. Seward Johnson, is an American artist best known for his trompe l\u2019oeil painted bronze statues. He is a grandson of Robert Wood Johnson (the co-founder of Johnson & Johnson), and Colonel Thomas Melville Dill, a prominent Bermudian lawyer and soldier. Many of Seward\u2019s works are unassuming slices of life that might go unnoticed by passers-by, but this epic work is literally larger than life. In 2009, a copy of the statue (The Awakening II) was installed near Chesterfield Central Park in Chesterfield, Missouri in 2009. The sculpture is located on the small beach area at the Potomac waterfront in National Harbor. If you're looking for it specifically, it's impossible to miss, but part of the fun is watching the alarmed looks of those who are just stumbling upon it for the first time.

Seward Johnson, entitled The Awakening. After spending much of his early career as a painter, Johnson turned to sculpture and is now best known for his life-sized work that portrays ordinary people communicating very realistic human gestures. The Awakening, a 70 foot giant, is one of Johnson's most dramatic works. Back in 1980, it was selected for the International Sculpture Conference Exhibition in Washington, D.C., and was originally located at Hains Point. Each of five separate aluminum pieces is buried in the ground, giving the impression that the full body is hidden beneath the surface. The man's face, hands, and parts of the right foot and the left knee are the only pieces that are actually visible.

The Awakening is an aluminum statue depicting a giant man desperately struggling to emerge from the earth. Made up of five parts, the giant\u2019s outstretched right arm towers 17 feet above the ground, and his bent left leg and knee rise above the earth, while his left hand and right foot just break the surface. His bearded face shows a look of abject terror with his mouth opening to unleash a primal scream. This striking work of art, created by John Seward Johnson II, was originally installed at Hains Point in Washington, D.C. in 1980, and was a jarring sight from above for visitors flying into National Airport from the south. The statue remained in place on the tip of Hains Point in East Potomac Park for 27 years. The statue was scheduled to be sold and sent to Japan, however, the developer of National Harbor Peterson Companies, purchased it and moved it to National Harbor, Maryland. The current location on the Potomac River, is just 15 miles from downtown Washington, D.C. The sculptor, J. Seward Johnson, is an American artist best known for his trompe l\u2019oeil painted bronze statues. He is a grandson of Robert Wood Johnson (the co-founder of Johnson & Johnson), and Colonel Thomas Melville Dill, a prominent Bermudian lawyer and soldier. Many of Seward\u2019s works are unassuming slices of life that might go unnoticed by passers-by, but this epic work is literally larger than life. In 2009, a copy of the statue (The Awakening II) was installed near Chesterfield Central Park in Chesterfield, Missouri in 2009. The sculpture is located on the small beach area at the Potomac waterfront in National Harbor. If you're looking for it specifically, it's impossible to miss, but part of the fun is watching the alarmed looks of those who are just stumbling upon it for the first time.

Seward Johnson, entitled The Awakening. After spending much of his early career as a painter, Johnson turned to sculpture and is now best known for his life-sized work that portrays ordinary people communicating very realistic human gestures. The Awakening, a 70 foot giant, is one of Johnson's most dramatic works. Back in 1980, it was selected for the International Sculpture Conference Exhibition in Washington, D.C., and was originally located at Hains Point. Each of five separate aluminum pieces is buried in the ground, giving the impression that the full body is hidden beneath the surface. The man's face, hands, and parts of the right foot and the left knee are the only pieces that are actually visible. Today, visitors can stop by the National Harbor to witness, first hand, the passionate energy that radiates from the installation of this distressed man, trying to break free from the earth. J.
