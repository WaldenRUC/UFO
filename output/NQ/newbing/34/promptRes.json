Written by Freddie Mercury in 1979, the track is included on their 1980 album The Game, and also appears on the band's compilation album Greatest Hits in 1981. The song peaked at number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, becoming the group's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US in 1980, remaining there for four consecutive weeks. It topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven weeks. It was the band's final single release of the 1970s. Having composed \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on guitar, Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live, which was the first time he played guitar in concert with Queen. Queen played the song live between 1979 and 1986, and a live performance of the song is recorded in the albums Queen Rock Montreal, Queen on Fire \u2013 Live at the Bowl, Live at Wembley '86 and Hungarian Rhapsody: Queen Live in Budapest. Since its release, the song has been covered by a number of artists. The song was played live on 20 April 1992 during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, performed by Robert Plant with Queen. The style of the song was described by author Karl Coryat as rockabilly in his 1999 book titled The Bass Player Book. As reported by Freddie Mercury in Melody Maker, 2 May 1981, he composed \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on the guitar in just five to ten minutes. 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' took me five or ten minutes. I did that on the guitar, which I can't play for nuts, and in one way it was quite a good thing because I was restricted, knowing only a few chords. It's a good discipline because I simply had to write within a small framework. I couldn't work through too many chords and because of that restriction I wrote a good song, I think. The song was written by Mercury as a tribute to his musical heroes Elvis Presley and Cliff Richard. Roger Taylor added in an interview that Mercury wrote it in just 10 minutes while lounging in a bath in the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich during one of their extensive Munich recording sessions. Mercury took it to the studio shortly after writing it and presented it to Taylor and John Deacon. The three of them, with their then new producer Reinhold Mack, recorded it at Musicland Studios in Munich. The entire song was reportedly recorded in less than half an hour (although Mack says it was six hours). Having written \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on guitar and played an acoustic rhythm guitar on the record, for the first time ever Mercury played guitar in concerts, for example at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, London in 1985. Billboard described Brian May's guitar playing as being \"stunning in its simplicity.\" Cash Box called it a \"hip shakin' rockabilly romp\" and an \"upbeat tune.\" Record World said that the band \"does a superb job of capturing the spirit and sound of the late '50s be-bop rock'n'roll.\" May wanted to emulate Rick Nelson's and Presley's longtime guitarist James Burton, and at Macks's suggestion used a Fender Esquire rather than his regular Red Special for the recording session. The music video for the song was filmed at Trillion Studios on 21 September 1979 and directed by Dennis De Vallance involving four dancers and a floor of hands. An alternate version was included on the Days of Our Lives DVD and Blu-ray releases. In the immediate aftermath of the single the band embarked on a mini UK tour entitled the Crazy Tour. Whenever the song was played live, the band added a solid rock ending that extended the under-three-minute track to over five minutes, with May and Mercury providing additional guitars. An example of this is on the CD/DVD Set Live at Wembley '86, where the song continues for five minutes. On Saturday, 13 July 1985, Queen performed the song for the Live Aid dual-venue benefit concert. The \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" single hit number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, and became the first US number-one hit for the band, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was knocked out of the top spot on this chart by Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II\". The song also topped the Australian ARIA charts for seven consecutive weeks from 1 March to 12 April 1980. The UK release had \"We Will Rock You (live)\" as the b-side and America, Australia, Canada had \"Spread Your Wings (live)\". Although Mercury played an acoustic-electric twelve-string Ovation Pacemaker 1615 guitar and later on an electric six-string Fender Telecaster (both owned by May) in the studio, he recorded this song using a six-string acoustic with external mics. Mercury also played the original guitar solo on a version which has been lost. * Sales figures based on certification alone.^ Ship\n\nquestion: Who wrote Crazy Little Thing Called Love?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Freddie Mercury", "usage": 1153}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Watch this video on YouTube Written solely by Freddie Mercury, the song became one of Queen\u2019s biggest international singles to that point.

It did even better in Australia, with a seven-week reign in March and April and platinum certification. The single was certified gold in both the US and UK, as well as in Holland. \u201cI wrote the song languishing in my bath at the Munich Hilton,\u201d Mercury said in the Billboard Book of Number One Hits, by Fred Bronson. Freddie reportedly got out of the tub to go to his guitar and piano to lay down the melody. \u201cWe arranged  at band rehearsals the following day with me trying to play rhythm guitar. Everyone loved it, so we recorded it. The finished version sounded like the bathroom version. It\u2019s not typical of my work, but that\u2019s because nothing is typical of my work.\u201d Listen to the best of Queen on Apple Music and Spotify. Mercury also revealed in that volume that Queen\u2019s American label, Elektra, were less than enthused about releasing \u201cCrazy Little Thing\u201d as a single, but their hand was forced when radio DJs started playing the import.

Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" by Queen: A Hit Single from the 1980 Album \"The Game\"\n\nevidence: \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. Written by Freddie Mercury in 1979, the track is included on their 1980 album The Game, and also appears on the band's compilation album Greatest Hits in 1981. The song peaked at number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, becoming the group's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US in 1980, remaining there for four consecutive weeks. It topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven weeks. It was the band's final single release of the 1970s. Having composed \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on guitar, Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live, which was the first time he played guitar in concert with Queen. Queen played the song live between 1979 and 1986, and a live performance of the song is recorded in the albums Queen Rock Montreal, Queen on Fire \u2013 Live at the Bowl, Live at Wembley '86 and Hungarian Rhapsody: Queen Live in Budapest. Since its release, the song has been covered by a number of artists. The song was played live on 20 April 1992 during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, performed by Robert Plant with Queen. The style of the song was described by author Karl Coryat as rockabilly in his 1999 book titled The Bass Player Book. As reported by Freddie Mercury in Melody Maker, 2 May 1981, he composed \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on the guitar in just five to ten minutes. 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' took me five or ten minutes. I did that on the guitar, which I can't play for nuts, and in one way it was quite a good thing because I was restricted, knowing only a few chords. It's a good discipline because I simply had to write within a small framework. I couldn't work through too many chords and because of that restriction I wrote a good song, I think. The song was written by Mercury as a tribute to his musical heroes Elvis Presley and Cliff Richard. Roger Taylor added in an interview that Mercury wrote it in just 10 minutes while lounging in a bath in the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich during one of their extensive Munich recording sessions. Mercury took it to the studio shortly after writing it and presented it to Taylor and John Deacon. The three of them, with their then new producer Reinhold Mack, recorded it at Musicland Studios in Munich. The entire song was reportedly recorded in less than half an hour (although Mack says it was six hours). Having written \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on guitar and played an acoustic rhythm guitar on the record, for the first time ever Mercury played guitar in concerts, for example at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, London in 1985. Billboard described Brian May's guitar playing as being \"stunning in its simplicity.\" Cash Box called it a \"hip shakin' rockabilly romp\" and an \"upbeat tune.\" Record World said that the band \"does a superb job of capturing the spirit and sound of the late '50s be-bop rock'n'roll.\" May wanted to emulate Rick Nelson's and Presley's longtime guitarist James Burton, and at Macks's suggestion used a Fender Esquire rather than his regular Red Special for the recording session. The music video for the song was filmed at Trillion Studios on 21 September 1979 and directed by Dennis De Vallance involving four dancers and a floor of hands. An alternate version was included on the Days of Our Lives DVD and Blu-ray releases. In the immediate aftermath of the single the band embarked on a mini UK tour entitled the Crazy Tour. Whenever the song was played live, the band added a solid rock ending that extended the under-three-minute track to over five minutes, with May and Mercury providing additional guitars. An example of this is on the CD/DVD Set Live at Wembley '86, where the song continues for five minutes. On Saturday, 13 July 1985, Queen performed the song for the Live Aid dual-venue benefit concert. The \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" single hit number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, and became the first US number-one hit for the band, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was knocked out of the top spot on this chart by Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II\". The song also topped the Australian ARIA charts for seven consecutive weeks from 1 March to 12 April 1980. The UK release had \"We Will Rock You (live)\" as the b-side and America, Australia, Canada had \"Spread Your Wings (live)\". Although Mercury played an acoustic-electric twelve-string Ovation Pacemaker 1615 guitar and later on an electric six-string Fender Telecaster (both owned by May) in the studio, he recorded this song using a six-string acoustic with external mics. Mercury also played the original guitar solo on a version which has been lost. * Sales figures based on certification alone.^ Ship\n\nquestion: When was Crazy Little Thing Called Love written?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "1979", "usage": 1153}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Published on By When Queen came up with their affectionate nod to the rock\u2019n\u2019roll sound of the 1950s, \u201cCrazy Little Thing Called Love,\u201d they knew they were in with a strong shot at a second UK No.1 to follow 1975\u2019s \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d It nearly happened, but not quite. The single spent two weeks at No.2 in November 1979, held off the top by Dr. Hook\u2019s pop confection \u201cWhen You\u2019re In Love With A Beautiful Woman.\u201d But on December 22, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100, on its way to becoming their first American No.1. Watch this video on YouTube Written solely by Freddie Mercury, the song became one of Queen\u2019s biggest international singles to that point. It was the highest of no fewer than 15 new entries on the American chart in that week before Christmas, at No.58. By the second half of February, \u201cLove\u201d was starting a five-week run at the top of that survey. It did even better in Australia, with a seven-week reign in March and April and platinum certification. The single was certified gold in both the US and UK, as well as in Holland. \u201cI wrote the song languishing in my bath at the Munich Hilton,\u201d Mercury said in the Billboard Book of Number One Hits, by Fred Bronson. Freddie reportedly got out of the tub to go to his guitar and piano to lay down the melody. \u201cWe arranged  at band rehearsals the following day with me trying to play rhythm guitar. Everyone loved it, so we recorded it. The finished version sounded like the bathroom version. It\u2019s not typical of my work, but that\u2019s because nothing is typical of my work.\u201d Listen to the best of Queen on Apple Music and Spotify. Mercury also revealed in that volume that Queen\u2019s American label, Elektra, were less than enthused about releasing \u201cCrazy Little Thing\u201d as a single, but their hand was forced when radio DJs started playing the import. It proved to be a wise decision. Buy or stream \u201cCrazy Little Thing Called Love\u201d on the Queen album The Game.

Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works, incorporating more diverse and innovative styles in their music. After the late and great Freddie Mercury died, Queen continued to tour with multiple acts including Paul Rodgers, and currently, Adam Lambert. more \u00bb Follow 75 fans Sheet Music PDF Playlist Written by: Freddie Mercury Lyrics \u00a9 Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC Lyrics Licensed & Provided by LyricFind We're doing our best to make sure our content is useful, accurate and safe.If by any chance you spot an inappropriate comment while navigating through our website please use this form to let us know, and we'll take care of it shortly.

Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" by Queen: A Hit Single from the 1980 Album \"The Game\"\n\nevidence: \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. Written by Freddie Mercury in 1979, the track is included on their 1980 album The Game, and also appears on the band's compilation album Greatest Hits in 1981. The song peaked at number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, becoming the group's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US in 1980, remaining there for four consecutive weeks. It topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven weeks. It was the band's final single release of the 1970s. Having composed \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on guitar, Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live, which was the first time he played guitar in concert with Queen. Queen played the song live between 1979 and 1986, and a live performance of the song is recorded in the albums Queen Rock Montreal, Queen on Fire \u2013 Live at the Bowl, Live at Wembley '86 and Hungarian Rhapsody: Queen Live in Budapest. Since its release, the song has been covered by a number of artists. The song was played live on 20 April 1992 during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, performed by Robert Plant with Queen. The style of the song was described by author Karl Coryat as rockabilly in his 1999 book titled The Bass Player Book. As reported by Freddie Mercury in Melody Maker, 2 May 1981, he composed \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on the guitar in just five to ten minutes. 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' took me five or ten minutes. I did that on the guitar, which I can't play for nuts, and in one way it was quite a good thing because I was restricted, knowing only a few chords. It's a good discipline because I simply had to write within a small framework. I couldn't work through too many chords and because of that restriction I wrote a good song, I think. The song was written by Mercury as a tribute to his musical heroes Elvis Presley and Cliff Richard. Roger Taylor added in an interview that Mercury wrote it in just 10 minutes while lounging in a bath in the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich during one of their extensive Munich recording sessions. Mercury took it to the studio shortly after writing it and presented it to Taylor and John Deacon. The three of them, with their then new producer Reinhold Mack, recorded it at Musicland Studios in Munich. The entire song was reportedly recorded in less than half an hour (although Mack says it was six hours). Having written \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on guitar and played an acoustic rhythm guitar on the record, for the first time ever Mercury played guitar in concerts, for example at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, London in 1985. Billboard described Brian May's guitar playing as being \"stunning in its simplicity.\" Cash Box called it a \"hip shakin' rockabilly romp\" and an \"upbeat tune.\" Record World said that the band \"does a superb job of capturing the spirit and sound of the late '50s be-bop rock'n'roll.\" May wanted to emulate Rick Nelson's and Presley's longtime guitarist James Burton, and at Macks's suggestion used a Fender Esquire rather than his regular Red Special for the recording session. The music video for the song was filmed at Trillion Studios on 21 September 1979 and directed by Dennis De Vallance involving four dancers and a floor of hands. An alternate version was included on the Days of Our Lives DVD and Blu-ray releases. In the immediate aftermath of the single the band embarked on a mini UK tour entitled the Crazy Tour. Whenever the song was played live, the band added a solid rock ending that extended the under-three-minute track to over five minutes, with May and Mercury providing additional guitars. An example of this is on the CD/DVD Set Live at Wembley '86, where the song continues for five minutes. On Saturday, 13 July 1985, Queen performed the song for the Live Aid dual-venue benefit concert. The \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" single hit number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, and became the first US number-one hit for the band, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was knocked out of the top spot on this chart by Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II\". The song also topped the Australian ARIA charts for seven consecutive weeks from 1 March to 12 April 1980. The UK release had \"We Will Rock You (live)\" as the b-side and America, Australia, Canada had \"Spread Your Wings (live)\". Although Mercury played an acoustic-electric twelve-string Ovation Pacemaker 1615 guitar and later on an electric six-string Fender Telecaster (both owned by May) in the studio, he recorded this song using a six-string acoustic with external mics. Mercury also played the original guitar solo on a version which has been lost. * Sales figures based on certification alone.^ Ship\n\nquestion: On which album is Crazy Little Thing Called Love included?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Game", "usage": 1155}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Published on By When Queen came up with their affectionate nod to the rock\u2019n\u2019roll sound of the 1950s, \u201cCrazy Little Thing Called Love,\u201d they knew they were in with a strong shot at a second UK No.1 to follow 1975\u2019s \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d It nearly happened, but not quite. The single spent two weeks at No.2 in November 1979, held off the top by Dr. Hook\u2019s pop confection \u201cWhen You\u2019re In Love With A Beautiful Woman.\u201d But on December 22, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100, on its way to becoming their first American No.1. Watch this video on YouTube Written solely by Freddie Mercury, the song became one of Queen\u2019s biggest international singles to that point. It was the highest of no fewer than 15 new entries on the American chart in that week before Christmas, at No.58. By the second half of February, \u201cLove\u201d was starting a five-week run at the top of that survey. It did even better in Australia, with a seven-week reign in March and April and platinum certification. The single was certified gold in both the US and UK, as well as in Holland. \u201cI wrote the song languishing in my bath at the Munich Hilton,\u201d Mercury said in the Billboard Book of Number One Hits, by Fred Bronson. Freddie reportedly got out of the tub to go to his guitar and piano to lay down the melody. \u201cWe arranged  at band rehearsals the following day with me trying to play rhythm guitar. Everyone loved it, so we recorded it. The finished version sounded like the bathroom version. It\u2019s not typical of my work, but that\u2019s because nothing is typical of my work.\u201d Listen to the best of Queen on Apple Music and Spotify. Mercury also revealed in that volume that Queen\u2019s American label, Elektra, were less than enthused about releasing \u201cCrazy Little Thing\u201d as a single, but their hand was forced when radio DJs started playing the import.

Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" by Queen: A Hit Single from the 1980 Album \"The Game\"\n\nevidence: \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. Written by Freddie Mercury in 1979, the track is included on their 1980 album The Game, and also appears on the band's compilation album Greatest Hits in 1981. The song peaked at number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, becoming the group's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US in 1980, remaining there for four consecutive weeks. It topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven weeks. It was the band's final single release of the 1970s. Having composed \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on guitar, Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live, which was the first time he played guitar in concert with Queen. Queen played the song live between 1979 and 1986, and a live performance of the song is recorded in the albums Queen Rock Montreal, Queen on Fire \u2013 Live at the Bowl, Live at Wembley '86 and Hungarian Rhapsody: Queen Live in Budapest. Since its release, the song has been covered by a number of artists. The song was played live on 20 April 1992 during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, performed by Robert Plant with Queen. The style of the song was described by author Karl Coryat as rockabilly in his 1999 book titled The Bass Player Book. As reported by Freddie Mercury in Melody Maker, 2 May 1981, he composed \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on the guitar in just five to ten minutes. 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' took me five or ten minutes. I did that on the guitar, which I can't play for nuts, and in one way it was quite a good thing because I was restricted, knowing only a few chords. It's a good discipline because I simply had to write within a small framework. I couldn't work through too many chords and because of that restriction I wrote a good song, I think. The song was written by Mercury as a tribute to his musical heroes Elvis Presley and Cliff Richard. Roger Taylor added in an interview that Mercury wrote it in just 10 minutes while lounging in a bath in the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich during one of their extensive Munich recording sessions. Mercury took it to the studio shortly after writing it and presented it to Taylor and John Deacon. The three of them, with their then new producer Reinhold Mack, recorded it at Musicland Studios in Munich. The entire song was reportedly recorded in less than half an hour (although Mack says it was six hours). Having written \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on guitar and played an acoustic rhythm guitar on the record, for the first time ever Mercury played guitar in concerts, for example at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, London in 1985. Billboard described Brian May's guitar playing as being \"stunning in its simplicity.\" Cash Box called it a \"hip shakin' rockabilly romp\" and an \"upbeat tune.\" Record World said that the band \"does a superb job of capturing the spirit and sound of the late '50s be-bop rock'n'roll.\" May wanted to emulate Rick Nelson's and Presley's longtime guitarist James Burton, and at Macks's suggestion used a Fender Esquire rather than his regular Red Special for the recording session. The music video for the song was filmed at Trillion Studios on 21 September 1979 and directed by Dennis De Vallance involving four dancers and a floor of hands. An alternate version was included on the Days of Our Lives DVD and Blu-ray releases. In the immediate aftermath of the single the band embarked on a mini UK tour entitled the Crazy Tour. Whenever the song was played live, the band added a solid rock ending that extended the under-three-minute track to over five minutes, with May and Mercury providing additional guitars. An example of this is on the CD/DVD Set Live at Wembley '86, where the song continues for five minutes. On Saturday, 13 July 1985, Queen performed the song for the Live Aid dual-venue benefit concert. The \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" single hit number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, and became the first US number-one hit for the band, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was knocked out of the top spot on this chart by Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II\". The song also topped the Australian ARIA charts for seven consecutive weeks from 1 March to 12 April 1980. The UK release had \"We Will Rock You (live)\" as the b-side and America, Australia, Canada had \"Spread Your Wings (live)\". Although Mercury played an acoustic-electric twelve-string Ovation Pacemaker 1615 guitar and later on an electric six-string Fender Telecaster (both owned by May) in the studio, he recorded this song using a six-string acoustic with external mics. Mercury also played the original guitar solo on a version which has been lost. * Sales figures based on certification alone.^ Ship\n\nquestion: On which compilation album does Crazy Little Thing Called Love appear?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Greatest Hits in 1981", "usage": 1161}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Published on By When Queen came up with their affectionate nod to the rock\u2019n\u2019roll sound of the 1950s, \u201cCrazy Little Thing Called Love,\u201d they knew they were in with a strong shot at a second UK No.1 to follow 1975\u2019s \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d It nearly happened, but not quite. The single spent two weeks at No.2 in November 1979, held off the top by Dr. Hook\u2019s pop confection \u201cWhen You\u2019re In Love With A Beautiful Woman.\u201d But on December 22, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100, on its way to becoming their first American No.1. Watch this video on YouTube Written solely by Freddie Mercury, the song became one of Queen\u2019s biggest international singles to that point. It was the highest of no fewer than 15 new entries on the American chart in that week before Christmas, at No.58. By the second half of February, \u201cLove\u201d was starting a five-week run at the top of that survey. It did even better in Australia, with a seven-week reign in March and April and platinum certification. The single was certified gold in both the US and UK, as well as in Holland. \u201cI wrote the song languishing in my bath at the Munich Hilton,\u201d Mercury said in the Billboard Book of Number One Hits, by Fred Bronson. Freddie reportedly got out of the tub to go to his guitar and piano to lay down the melody. \u201cWe arranged  at band rehearsals the following day with me trying to play rhythm guitar. Everyone loved it, so we recorded it. The finished version sounded like the bathroom version. It\u2019s not typical of my work, but that\u2019s because nothing is typical of my work.\u201d Listen to the best of Queen on Apple Music and Spotify. Mercury also revealed in that volume that Queen\u2019s American label, Elektra, were less than enthused about releasing \u201cCrazy Little Thing\u201d as a single, but their hand was forced when radio DJs started playing the import. It proved to be a wise decision. Buy or stream \u201cCrazy Little Thing Called Love\u201d on the Queen album The Game.

Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" by Queen: A Hit Single from the 1980 Album \"The Game\"\n\nevidence: \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" is a song by the British rock band Queen. Written by Freddie Mercury in 1979, the track is included on their 1980 album The Game, and also appears on the band's compilation album Greatest Hits in 1981. The song peaked at number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, becoming the group's first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US in 1980, remaining there for four consecutive weeks. It topped the Australian ARIA Charts for seven weeks. It was the band's final single release of the 1970s. Having composed \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on guitar, Mercury played rhythm guitar while performing the song live, which was the first time he played guitar in concert with Queen. Queen played the song live between 1979 and 1986, and a live performance of the song is recorded in the albums Queen Rock Montreal, Queen on Fire \u2013 Live at the Bowl, Live at Wembley '86 and Hungarian Rhapsody: Queen Live in Budapest. Since its release, the song has been covered by a number of artists. The song was played live on 20 April 1992 during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, performed by Robert Plant with Queen. The style of the song was described by author Karl Coryat as rockabilly in his 1999 book titled The Bass Player Book. As reported by Freddie Mercury in Melody Maker, 2 May 1981, he composed \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on the guitar in just five to ten minutes. 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' took me five or ten minutes. I did that on the guitar, which I can't play for nuts, and in one way it was quite a good thing because I was restricted, knowing only a few chords. It's a good discipline because I simply had to write within a small framework. I couldn't work through too many chords and because of that restriction I wrote a good song, I think. The song was written by Mercury as a tribute to his musical heroes Elvis Presley and Cliff Richard. Roger Taylor added in an interview that Mercury wrote it in just 10 minutes while lounging in a bath in the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich during one of their extensive Munich recording sessions. Mercury took it to the studio shortly after writing it and presented it to Taylor and John Deacon. The three of them, with their then new producer Reinhold Mack, recorded it at Musicland Studios in Munich. The entire song was reportedly recorded in less than half an hour (although Mack says it was six hours). Having written \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" on guitar and played an acoustic rhythm guitar on the record, for the first time ever Mercury played guitar in concerts, for example at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, London in 1985. Billboard described Brian May's guitar playing as being \"stunning in its simplicity.\" Cash Box called it a \"hip shakin' rockabilly romp\" and an \"upbeat tune.\" Record World said that the band \"does a superb job of capturing the spirit and sound of the late '50s be-bop rock'n'roll.\" May wanted to emulate Rick Nelson's and Presley's longtime guitarist James Burton, and at Macks's suggestion used a Fender Esquire rather than his regular Red Special for the recording session. The music video for the song was filmed at Trillion Studios on 21 September 1979 and directed by Dennis De Vallance involving four dancers and a floor of hands. An alternate version was included on the Days of Our Lives DVD and Blu-ray releases. In the immediate aftermath of the single the band embarked on a mini UK tour entitled the Crazy Tour. Whenever the song was played live, the band added a solid rock ending that extended the under-three-minute track to over five minutes, with May and Mercury providing additional guitars. An example of this is on the CD/DVD Set Live at Wembley '86, where the song continues for five minutes. On Saturday, 13 July 1985, Queen performed the song for the Live Aid dual-venue benefit concert. The \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" single hit number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, and became the first US number-one hit for the band, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks. It was knocked out of the top spot on this chart by Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II\". The song also topped the Australian ARIA charts for seven consecutive weeks from 1 March to 12 April 1980. The UK release had \"We Will Rock You (live)\" as the b-side and America, Australia, Canada had \"Spread Your Wings (live)\". Although Mercury played an acoustic-electric twelve-string Ovation Pacemaker 1615 guitar and later on an electric six-string Fender Telecaster (both owned by May) in the studio, he recorded this song using a six-string acoustic with external mics. Mercury also played the original guitar solo on a version which has been lost. * Sales figures based on certification alone.^ Ship\n\nquestion: What is Crazy Little Thing Called Love known as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Rockabilly", "usage": 1155}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Published on By When Queen came up with their affectionate nod to the rock\u2019n\u2019roll sound of the 1950s, \u201cCrazy Little Thing Called Love,\u201d they knew they were in with a strong shot at a second UK No.1 to follow 1975\u2019s \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201d It nearly happened, but not quite. The single spent two weeks at No.2 in November 1979, held off the top by Dr. Hook\u2019s pop confection \u201cWhen You\u2019re In Love With A Beautiful Woman.\u201d But on December 22, the song entered the Billboard Hot 100, on its way to becoming their first American No.1. Watch this video on YouTube Written solely by Freddie Mercury, the song became one of Queen\u2019s biggest international singles to that point. It was the highest of no fewer than 15 new entries on the American chart in that week before Christmas, at No.58. By the second half of February, \u201cLove\u201d was starting a five-week run at the top of that survey. It did even better in Australia, with a seven-week reign in March and April and platinum certification. The single was certified gold in both the US and UK, as well as in Holland. \u201cI wrote the song languishing in my bath at the Munich Hilton,\u201d Mercury said in the Billboard Book of Number One Hits, by Fred Bronson. Freddie reportedly got out of the tub to go to his guitar and piano to lay down the melody. \u201cWe arranged  at band rehearsals the following day with me trying to play rhythm guitar. Everyone loved it, so we recorded it. The finished version sounded like the bathroom version. It\u2019s not typical of my work, but that\u2019s because nothing is typical of my work.\u201d Listen to the best of Queen on Apple Music and Spotify. Mercury also revealed in that volume that Queen\u2019s American label, Elektra, were less than enthused about releasing \u201cCrazy Little Thing\u201d as a single, but their hand was forced when radio DJs started playing the import. It proved to be a wise decision. Buy or stream \u201cCrazy Little Thing Called Love\u201d on the Queen album The Game.
