If you own a vehicle and drive it at least once a week, you\u2019ve probably already replaced the factory tires. And, you know that they require regular maintenance and proper care. Crafted from hard rubber, car tires cover the wheels, support the weight of the car and ensure a smooth ride quality. But did you know that the tire market is predicted to reach $122 billion by 2026? This is quite a big and powerful industry, and today, we\u2019ll learn about the largest tire manufacturers this year. We\u2019ll go over the likes of Michelin, Bridgestone, Goodyear, and other world-famous brands to figure out which company is leading the market. So, what does the mightiest tire brand look like? Let\u2019s find out! A post shared by Meaty Fitment (@meaty.fitment) Headquartered in Tokyo, Bridgestone is leading the charge in 2021. This is achieved thanks to the impressive number of manufacturing plants (139 facilities in 24 countries) and employees (135,000 workers in various factories). Last year, the company made $29 billion, which is an absolute record for the tire industry. Bridgestone mainly produces tires for passenger cars and trucks. The brand also makes specialty tires for aircraft, two-wheelers, and the agricultural sector. Known as the largest tire/rubber manufacturer on the planet with a presence in more than 150 countries Bridgestone is, indeed, an international company. They make the biggest profit in the Americas and Japan (43% and 26%, respectively). A post shared by Roman Tikhonov (@cyanide227) Michelin is the largest tire brand in Europe\u2014has been for quite some time now. And it\u2019s the second-largest manufacturer in the world. Based in France, the company has 51 manufacturing plants in 18 countries and over 125,000 employees. In 2021, Michelin made $27 billion in revenue, which puts it slightly behind Bridgestone. This manufacturer\u2019s line-up includes tires of all shapes and sizes that fit pretty much any car out there, big or small. You\u2019ve probably seen their mascot once or twice or have heard about the Red Guide awards for restaurants. Founded back in 1889 by two brothers, today, it\u2019s a multi-billion brand. A post shared by Goodyear (@goodyear) With total revenue of 17.5 billion dollars, you could say that this manufacturer did, indeed, have a good year in 2021. Compared to Bridgestone and Michelin, it\u2019s not as big, even though it does have 48 plants in 21 countries. Now, Goodyear is one of the two US-based companies to make it into this list. Based in Ohio, it\u2019s been around since 1898. Cars, SUVs, commercial and light trucks, and earth-moving machinery\u2014this manufacturer produces it all. It managed to rise to the top thanks to its low-maintenance, easy-to-detach tires. And Goodyear is considered the most successful F1 supplier ever. The company was named after the man who created vulcanized rubber, Mr. Charles Goodyear. A post shared by Continental Tire (@continental_tire) Moving on with the list, we\u2019ve got Continental AG\u2014a German mogul that specializes in tires, brake systems, safety equipment, and chassis components. In 2021, the company\u2019s revenue was almost $40 billion! However, they only made $13 billion selling tires (it\u2019s one of Continental\u2019s six divisions), and that\u2019s why we put it on the #4 spot. This is still a very impressive result, especially given the number of facilities: 13. Continental is the fourth-largest tire producer in the world (and the second largest in Europe) and owns brands like Viking, Gislaved, and General, to name a few. Oh, and by the way, this is the oldest manufacturer on the list (founded in 1871). A post shared by G&M TYRES (@sbm_gmtyres) To stand out from the competition, Sumitomo focuses on advanced, forward-thinking technology. This brand\u2019s tires are long-lasting, easy to maintain, and highly reliable. That\u2019s especially true for their winter tires. Sumitomo Rubber Industries has been on the market for more than 100 years and has 40K employees working in 73 global facilities. The annual revenue for 2021 was almost $7 billion. That\u2019s more than four times less than what Bridgestone, a fellow Japanese company, made that same year. Nevertheless, SRI is a highly successful brand and has a strong foothold on the market, along with a stellar reputation.

The number of workers and production facilities is more than decent, and the brand is operating in 160 countries. Based in Milan, it mainly produces tires for bicycles, bikes, and, of course, cars. Pirelli makes premium-quality racing tires as well. Back in 2015, ChemChina took a controlling interest in the company. However, the Chinese mogul agreed to not change anything in the structure until 2023. More than that, the new investments allowed Pirelli to take tire production to the next level. A post shared by Hankook Brasil (@hankookbr) Known as one of the most trusted and renowned tire brands in Asia, Hankook is a South Korean company. Just like Sumitomo, it\u2019s all about innovative technology. By the way, Hankook translates as Korea, and it is a relatively new player on the market (founded in 1941) that doesn\u2019t have dozens of manufacturing plants (eight facilities in seven countries across the globe). With that said, clever marketing and top-notch production allow it to be the seventh-biggest tire company, manufacturing roughly around 100 million tires a year. Hankook made almost as much money in 2021 as Pirelli ($6.12 billion vs. $6.15) A post shared by WESTLAKE BARQUISIMETO (@westlake_barquisimeto) ZC Rubber (also known as the Zhongce Rubber Group) is a Chinese company. It only took it a decade or two to turn into a large-scale manufacturer. Now, every single ZC manufacturing plant is located in China\u201425 in total. And, they have 20,000 employees, more than enough to handle the production. GreatStar Group, a Chinese conglomerate, has a controlling interest in ZC shares, and thanks to its generous investments, the tire maker\u2019s revenue in 2021 reached 4.8 billion dollars a year. A post shared by Toni Zajakovski (@toni_zestino_aus) Going back to Japan, we have Yokohama, another Tokyo-based business. Established in 1917, it entered the American market in 1969, and that\u2019s when it turned into a truly global brand. Right now, Yokohama has 16 production facilities in seven countries and more than 27,000 workers, which allowed it to close 2021 with $4.1 billion in revenue. In Japan, Yokohama tires are mostly sold under the \u201cADVAN\u201d brand. These tires are highly rated as an aftermarket replacement. A post shared by Wake the signal up! (@6551east) Cheng Shin is the second-largest tire manufacturer after ZC Rubber. This is a Taiwan-based enterprise with annual revenue of $3.5\u20134 billion ($3.7 billion made in 2021). If you\u2019re a fan of the Maxxis or CST tires, just know that they are 100% owned by Cheng Shin Rubber. Employing over 20,000 people, CSR is the top producer of bicycle tires on the planet, distributing its product to 150 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. A post shared by \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude54\ud835\ude4a \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude4e (@toyotires) Toyo Tires positions itself as a tire and rubber products company. They excel at commercial truck tires that are praised worldwide for their stellar performance and extended lifespan. Toyo\u2019s engineers are constantly looking for new ways to improve the original \u201cformula\u201d. That helps the brand not just to stay afloat but run a successful business ($2.9 billion in their \u201cpocket\u201d in 2021). A post shared by Cooper Tires Philippines (@coopertiresph) Competitively priced and easy to maintain, the Cooper Tires are available for trucks, SUVs, minivans, and motorcycles. With more than 100 years of experience behind its back, this company knows exactly how to appeal to its target audience. The production scale isn\u2019t chart-topping (10 plants in six countries; 10,000 employees). Yet, despite the pandemic and the economic crisis, Cooper\u2019s revenue last year was $2.8 billion. A post shared by Apollo Tyres (@apollotyresltd) Founded in 1972, Apollo Tyres, an Indian manufacturer, quickly rose to stardom thanks to big investments, advanced technological solutions, and strong management. Mostly based in India (five plants), Apollo also has facilities in Hungary and the Netherlands. These are rather big facilities, though, as 19,000 people are working there. Revenue of $2.7 billion makes Apollo one of the largest tire manufacturers of our time.

In 2021, it fell slightly behind with $2.2 billion vs. $2.7. The number of manufacturing plants is higher, though (10 in total), but they\u2019re all located in India. The Madras Rubber Factory makes paints, toys, treads, and tires. It started out making balloons, but in 1952 the focus switched to rubber. A post shared by Auto Life (@autolife.jp) With just five facilities in three countries, Nokian Tyres still managed to make it into the list. The number of employees is quite low, too (compared to the competition), but that didn\u2019t stop this company from making 2 billion American dollars in 2021. This is the youngest tire manufacturer, by the way\u2014it was established in 1988 and is only 34 years old. Based in the Finnish town of the same name, Nokian Tyres operates in 130 countries. The short answer is rubber, and back in the day, the so-called \u201crubber trees\u201d were the sole source for it. However, with the demand for latex rising exponentially and mass deforestation in South America turning into a problem, it was clear that the industry was in need of an alternative. In 1909 Fritz Hofmann, a German chemist, introduced the concept of synthetic rubber. And 22 years later (in 1931, to be exact), a US-based company started large-scale synthetic rubber production. These days, car tires are a combination of both (24% synthetic and 19% natural rubber) mixed in with steel and fillers. This makes it possible to keep production costs low and eliminate the chance of shortages on the market. It all comes down to how much you\u2019re willing to pay. For example, an entry-level tire will cost you $50\u2013$150. If you have the budget for a decent-quality tire, be ready to pay $120\u2013$300. As for premium-quality \u201crubber\u201d, it usually costs $350\u2013$1,000. On average, US drivers pay $500\u2013$750 for a full set (four tires). Are you an avid off-roader and competitive driver? Then you might want to save a bit and get high-end, performance-oriented tires. The reason: the less expensive ones will wear out soon, especially if you constantly drive over rough terrain. In contrast, for everyday driving, cheap tires will be the right choice. They are affordable yet last for more than a couple of years. This depends on the car, your driving habits, the area that you live in, and maintenance. A decent-quality set of tires will serve you for 3\u20135 years, which equals 45\u201375K miles. The NHTSA doesn\u2019t have any strict recommendations, while manufacturers claim their tires last for at least 6\u201310 years. In any case, you should run regular checks for signs of wear, tear, cracks, low air pressure, misalignment, and other issues. Natural elements can also have a huge negative impact. Now, tires that have been around for more than 10 years are a disaster waiting to happen. First, they\u2019ll be too weak to support the weight of the vehicle. Second, no matter how good you are at maintenance, the rubber won\u2019t be able to perform at quite the same level it used to. We recommend having the tires checked thoroughly by a mechanic once you reach the 6\u20138 year threshold. As far as the most important parts of any modern-day vehicle go, tires are right there on top of the list. You simply won\u2019t be able to drive your car without a proper tire set! This is a gigantic industry, with multi-billion companies fighting to win over customers. This year, low-cost manufacturing and high demand are anticipated to drive tire production to an all-time high. Today, we checked out 15 best-selling tire brands to find the biggest manufacturer. So, if you only want to trust the #1 brand with your tires, now you know which company to go with! Just make sure to have the tires checked regularly, keep them properly aligned, and don\u2019t overload the vehicle.

While one would assume this award goes to one of the tires commonly seen on the road like Bridgestone or Goodyear, it might be a surprise to know it\u2019s actually LEGO Group. That\u2019s right, the Guinness World Record holder for \u201clargest tire manufacturer per year\u201d goes to LEGO. The honor was bestowed on them in 2012. The huge amount of tires created every year is because nearly half of all LEGO sets include wheels of some sort. This wasn\u2019t always the case, though. LEGO tires are a relatively recent creation.

If you own a vehicle and drive it at least once a week, you\u2019ve probably already replaced the factory tires. And, you know that they require regular maintenance and proper care. Crafted from hard rubber, car tires cover the wheels, support the weight of the car and ensure a smooth ride quality. But did you know that the tire market is predicted to reach $122 billion by 2026? This is quite a big and powerful industry, and today, we\u2019ll learn about the largest tire manufacturers this year. We\u2019ll go over the likes of Michelin, Bridgestone, Goodyear, and other world-famous brands to figure out which company is leading the market. So, what does the mightiest tire brand look like? Let\u2019s find out! A post shared by Meaty Fitment (@meaty.fitment) Headquartered in Tokyo, Bridgestone is leading the charge in 2021. This is achieved thanks to the impressive number of manufacturing plants (139 facilities in 24 countries) and employees (135,000 workers in various factories). Last year, the company made $29 billion, which is an absolute record for the tire industry. Bridgestone mainly produces tires for passenger cars and trucks. The brand also makes specialty tires for aircraft, two-wheelers, and the agricultural sector. Known as the largest tire/rubber manufacturer on the planet with a presence in more than 150 countries Bridgestone is, indeed, an international company. They make the biggest profit in the Americas and Japan (43% and 26%, respectively). A post shared by Roman Tikhonov (@cyanide227) Michelin is the largest tire brand in Europe\u2014has been for quite some time now. And it\u2019s the second-largest manufacturer in the world. Based in France, the company has 51 manufacturing plants in 18 countries and over 125,000 employees. In 2021, Michelin made $27 billion in revenue, which puts it slightly behind Bridgestone. This manufacturer\u2019s line-up includes tires of all shapes and sizes that fit pretty much any car out there, big or small. You\u2019ve probably seen their mascot once or twice or have heard about the Red Guide awards for restaurants. Founded back in 1889 by two brothers, today, it\u2019s a multi-billion brand. A post shared by Goodyear (@goodyear) With total revenue of 17.5 billion dollars, you could say that this manufacturer did, indeed, have a good year in 2021. Compared to Bridgestone and Michelin, it\u2019s not as big, even though it does have 48 plants in 21 countries. Now, Goodyear is one of the two US-based companies to make it into this list. Based in Ohio, it\u2019s been around since 1898. Cars, SUVs, commercial and light trucks, and earth-moving machinery\u2014this manufacturer produces it all. It managed to rise to the top thanks to its low-maintenance, easy-to-detach tires. And Goodyear is considered the most successful F1 supplier ever. The company was named after the man who created vulcanized rubber, Mr. Charles Goodyear. A post shared by Continental Tire (@continental_tire) Moving on with the list, we\u2019ve got Continental AG\u2014a German mogul that specializes in tires, brake systems, safety equipment, and chassis components. In 2021, the company\u2019s revenue was almost $40 billion! However, they only made $13 billion selling tires (it\u2019s one of Continental\u2019s six divisions), and that\u2019s why we put it on the #4 spot. This is still a very impressive result, especially given the number of facilities: 13. Continental is the fourth-largest tire producer in the world (and the second largest in Europe) and owns brands like Viking, Gislaved, and General, to name a few. Oh, and by the way, this is the oldest manufacturer on the list (founded in 1871). A post shared by G&M TYRES (@sbm_gmtyres) To stand out from the competition, Sumitomo focuses on advanced, forward-thinking technology. This brand\u2019s tires are long-lasting, easy to maintain, and highly reliable. That\u2019s especially true for their winter tires. Sumitomo Rubber Industries has been on the market for more than 100 years and has 40K employees working in 73 global facilities. The annual revenue for 2021 was almost $7 billion. That\u2019s more than four times less than what Bridgestone, a fellow Japanese company, made that same year. Nevertheless, SRI is a highly successful brand and has a strong foothold on the market, along with a stellar reputation.

The number of workers and production facilities is more than decent, and the brand is operating in 160 countries. Based in Milan, it mainly produces tires for bicycles, bikes, and, of course, cars. Pirelli makes premium-quality racing tires as well. Back in 2015, ChemChina took a controlling interest in the company. However, the Chinese mogul agreed to not change anything in the structure until 2023. More than that, the new investments allowed Pirelli to take tire production to the next level. A post shared by Hankook Brasil (@hankookbr) Known as one of the most trusted and renowned tire brands in Asia, Hankook is a South Korean company. Just like Sumitomo, it\u2019s all about innovative technology. By the way, Hankook translates as Korea, and it is a relatively new player on the market (founded in 1941) that doesn\u2019t have dozens of manufacturing plants (eight facilities in seven countries across the globe). With that said, clever marketing and top-notch production allow it to be the seventh-biggest tire company, manufacturing roughly around 100 million tires a year. Hankook made almost as much money in 2021 as Pirelli ($6.12 billion vs. $6.15) A post shared by WESTLAKE BARQUISIMETO (@westlake_barquisimeto) ZC Rubber (also known as the Zhongce Rubber Group) is a Chinese company. It only took it a decade or two to turn into a large-scale manufacturer. Now, every single ZC manufacturing plant is located in China\u201425 in total. And, they have 20,000 employees, more than enough to handle the production. GreatStar Group, a Chinese conglomerate, has a controlling interest in ZC shares, and thanks to its generous investments, the tire maker\u2019s revenue in 2021 reached 4.8 billion dollars a year. A post shared by Toni Zajakovski (@toni_zestino_aus) Going back to Japan, we have Yokohama, another Tokyo-based business. Established in 1917, it entered the American market in 1969, and that\u2019s when it turned into a truly global brand. Right now, Yokohama has 16 production facilities in seven countries and more than 27,000 workers, which allowed it to close 2021 with $4.1 billion in revenue. In Japan, Yokohama tires are mostly sold under the \u201cADVAN\u201d brand. These tires are highly rated as an aftermarket replacement. A post shared by Wake the signal up! (@6551east) Cheng Shin is the second-largest tire manufacturer after ZC Rubber. This is a Taiwan-based enterprise with annual revenue of $3.5\u20134 billion ($3.7 billion made in 2021). If you\u2019re a fan of the Maxxis or CST tires, just know that they are 100% owned by Cheng Shin Rubber. Employing over 20,000 people, CSR is the top producer of bicycle tires on the planet, distributing its product to 150 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

They excel at commercial truck tires that are praised worldwide for their stellar performance and extended lifespan. Toyo\u2019s engineers are constantly looking for new ways to improve the original \u201cformula\u201d. That helps the brand not just to stay afloat but run a successful business ($2.9 billion in their \u201cpocket\u201d in 2021). A post shared by Cooper Tires Philippines (@coopertiresph) Competitively priced and easy to maintain, the Cooper Tires are available for trucks, SUVs, minivans, and motorcycles. With more than 100 years of experience behind its back, this company knows exactly how to appeal to its target audience. The production scale isn\u2019t chart-topping (10 plants in six countries; 10,000 employees). Yet, despite the pandemic and the economic crisis, Cooper\u2019s revenue last year was $2.8 billion. A post shared by Apollo Tyres (@apollotyresltd) Founded in 1972, Apollo Tyres, an Indian manufacturer, quickly rose to stardom thanks to big investments, advanced technological solutions, and strong management. Mostly based in India (five plants), Apollo also has facilities in Hungary and the Netherlands. These are rather big facilities, though, as 19,000 people are working there. Revenue of $2.7 billion makes Apollo one of the largest tire manufacturers of our time.

A post shared by Goodyear (@goodyear) With total revenue of 17.5 billion dollars, you could say that this manufacturer did, indeed, have a good year in 2021. Compared to Bridgestone and Michelin, it\u2019s not as big, even though it does have 48 plants in 21 countries. Now, Goodyear is one of the two US-based companies to make it into this list. Based in Ohio, it\u2019s been around since 1898. Cars, SUVs, commercial and light trucks, and earth-moving machinery\u2014this manufacturer produces it all. It managed to rise to the top thanks to its low-maintenance, easy-to-detach tires. And Goodyear is considered the most successful F1 supplier ever. The company was named after the man who created vulcanized rubber, Mr. Charles Goodyear. A post shared by Continental Tire (@continental_tire) Moving on with the list, we\u2019ve got Continental AG\u2014a German mogul that specializes in tires, brake systems, safety equipment, and chassis components. In 2021, the company\u2019s revenue was almost $40 billion! However, they only made $13 billion selling tires (it\u2019s one of Continental\u2019s six divisions), and that\u2019s why we put it on the #4 spot. This is still a very impressive result, especially given the number of facilities: 13. Continental is the fourth-largest tire producer in the world (and the second largest in Europe) and owns brands like Viking, Gislaved, and General, to name a few. Oh, and by the way, this is the oldest manufacturer on the list (founded in 1871). A post shared by G&M TYRES (@sbm_gmtyres) To stand out from the competition, Sumitomo focuses on advanced, forward-thinking technology. This brand\u2019s tires are long-lasting, easy to maintain, and highly reliable. That\u2019s especially true for their winter tires. Sumitomo Rubber Industries has been on the market for more than 100 years and has 40K employees working in 73 global facilities. The annual revenue for 2021 was almost $7 billion. That\u2019s more than four times less than what Bridgestone, a fellow Japanese company, made that same year. Nevertheless, SRI is a highly successful brand and has a strong foothold on the market, along with a stellar reputation.

The number of workers and production facilities is more than decent, and the brand is operating in 160 countries. Based in Milan, it mainly produces tires for bicycles, bikes, and, of course, cars. Pirelli makes premium-quality racing tires as well. Back in 2015, ChemChina took a controlling interest in the company. However, the Chinese mogul agreed to not change anything in the structure until 2023. More than that, the new investments allowed Pirelli to take tire production to the next level. A post shared by Hankook Brasil (@hankookbr) Known as one of the most trusted and renowned tire brands in Asia, Hankook is a South Korean company. Just like Sumitomo, it\u2019s all about innovative technology. By the way, Hankook translates as Korea, and it is a relatively new player on the market (founded in 1941) that doesn\u2019t have dozens of manufacturing plants (eight facilities in seven countries across the globe). With that said, clever marketing and top-notch production allow it to be the seventh-biggest tire company, manufacturing roughly around 100 million tires a year. Hankook made almost as much money in 2021 as Pirelli ($6.12 billion vs. $6.15) A post shared by WESTLAKE BARQUISIMETO (@westlake_barquisimeto) ZC Rubber (also known as the Zhongce Rubber Group) is a Chinese company. It only took it a decade or two to turn into a large-scale manufacturer. Now, every single ZC manufacturing plant is located in China\u201425 in total. And, they have 20,000 employees, more than enough to handle the production. GreatStar Group, a Chinese conglomerate, has a controlling interest in ZC shares, and thanks to its generous investments, the tire maker\u2019s revenue in 2021 reached 4.8 billion dollars a year. A post shared by Toni Zajakovski (@toni_zestino_aus) Going back to Japan, we have Yokohama, another Tokyo-based business. Established in 1917, it entered the American market in 1969, and that\u2019s when it turned into a truly global brand. Right now, Yokohama has 16 production facilities in seven countries and more than 27,000 workers, which allowed it to close 2021 with $4.1 billion in revenue. In Japan, Yokohama tires are mostly sold under the \u201cADVAN\u201d brand. These tires are highly rated as an aftermarket replacement. A post shared by Wake the signal up! (@6551east) Cheng Shin is the second-largest tire manufacturer after ZC Rubber. This is a Taiwan-based enterprise with annual revenue of $3.5\u20134 billion ($3.7 billion made in 2021). If you\u2019re a fan of the Maxxis or CST tires, just know that they are 100% owned by Cheng Shin Rubber. Employing over 20,000 people, CSR is the top producer of bicycle tires on the planet, distributing its product to 150 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

Toyo\u2019s engineers are constantly looking for new ways to improve the original \u201cformula\u201d. That helps the brand not just to stay afloat but run a successful business ($2.9 billion in their \u201cpocket\u201d in 2021). A post shared by Cooper Tires Philippines (@coopertiresph) Competitively priced and easy to maintain, the Cooper Tires are available for trucks, SUVs, minivans, and motorcycles. With more than 100 years of experience behind its back, this company knows exactly how to appeal to its target audience. The production scale isn\u2019t chart-topping (10 plants in six countries; 10,000 employees). Yet, despite the pandemic and the economic crisis, Cooper\u2019s revenue last year was $2.8 billion. A post shared by Apollo Tyres (@apollotyresltd) Founded in 1972, Apollo Tyres, an Indian manufacturer, quickly rose to stardom thanks to big investments, advanced technological solutions, and strong management. Mostly based in India (five plants), Apollo also has facilities in Hungary and the Netherlands. These are rather big facilities, though, as 19,000 people are working there. Revenue of $2.7 billion makes Apollo one of the largest tire manufacturers of our time.

In 2021, it fell slightly behind with $2.2 billion vs. $2.7. The number of manufacturing plants is higher, though (10 in total), but they\u2019re all located in India. The Madras Rubber Factory makes paints, toys, treads, and tires. It started out making balloons, but in 1952 the focus switched to rubber. A post shared by Auto Life (@autolife.jp) With just five facilities in three countries, Nokian Tyres still managed to make it into the list. The number of employees is quite low, too (compared to the competition), but that didn\u2019t stop this company from making 2 billion American dollars in 2021. This is the youngest tire manufacturer, by the way\u2014it was established in 1988 and is only 34 years old. Based in the Finnish town of the same name, Nokian Tyres operates in 130 countries. The short answer is rubber, and back in the day, the so-called \u201crubber trees\u201d were the sole source for it. However, with the demand for latex rising exponentially and mass deforestation in South America turning into a problem, it was clear that the industry was in need of an alternative. In 1909 Fritz Hofmann, a German chemist, introduced the concept of synthetic rubber. And 22 years later (in 1931, to be exact), a US-based company started large-scale synthetic rubber production. These days, car tires are a combination of both (24% synthetic and 19% natural rubber) mixed in with steel and fillers. This makes it possible to keep production costs low and eliminate the chance of shortages on the market. It all comes down to how much you\u2019re willing to pay. For example, an entry-level tire will cost you $50\u2013$150. If you have the budget for a decent-quality tire, be ready to pay $120\u2013$300. As for premium-quality \u201crubber\u201d, it usually costs $350\u2013$1,000. On average, US drivers pay $500\u2013$750 for a full set (four tires). Are you an avid off-roader and competitive driver? Then you might want to save a bit and get high-end, performance-oriented tires. The reason: the less expensive ones will wear out soon, especially if you constantly drive over rough terrain. In contrast, for everyday driving, cheap tires will be the right choice. They are affordable yet last for more than a couple of years. This depends on the car, your driving habits, the area that you live in, and maintenance. A decent-quality set of tires will serve you for 3\u20135 years, which equals 45\u201375K miles. The NHTSA doesn\u2019t have any strict recommendations, while manufacturers claim their tires last for at least 6\u201310 years. In any case, you should run regular checks for signs of wear, tear, cracks, low air pressure, misalignment, and other issues. Natural elements can also have a huge negative impact. Now, tires that have been around for more than 10 years are a disaster waiting to happen. First, they\u2019ll be too weak to support the weight of the vehicle. Second, no matter how good you are at maintenance, the rubber won\u2019t be able to perform at quite the same level it used to. We recommend having the tires checked thoroughly by a mechanic once you reach the 6\u20138 year threshold. As far as the most important parts of any modern-day vehicle go, tires are right there on top of the list. You simply won\u2019t be able to drive your car without a proper tire set! This is a gigantic industry, with multi-billion companies fighting to win over customers. This year, low-cost manufacturing and high demand are anticipated to drive tire production to an all-time high. Today, we checked out 15 best-selling tire brands to find the biggest manufacturer. So, if you only want to trust the #1 brand with your tires, now you know which company to go with! Just make sure to have the tires checked regularly, keep them properly aligned, and don\u2019t overload the vehicle.

If you own a vehicle and drive it at least once a week, you\u2019ve probably already replaced the factory tires. And, you know that they require regular maintenance and proper care. Crafted from hard rubber, car tires cover the wheels, support the weight of the car and ensure a smooth ride quality. But did you know that the tire market is predicted to reach $122 billion by 2026? This is quite a big and powerful industry, and today, we\u2019ll learn about the largest tire manufacturers this year. We\u2019ll go over the likes of Michelin, Bridgestone, Goodyear, and other world-famous brands to figure out which company is leading the market. So, what does the mightiest tire brand look like? Let\u2019s find out! A post shared by Meaty Fitment (@meaty.fitment) Headquartered in Tokyo, Bridgestone is leading the charge in 2021. This is achieved thanks to the impressive number of manufacturing plants (139 facilities in 24 countries) and employees (135,000 workers in various factories). Last year, the company made $29 billion, which is an absolute record for the tire industry. Bridgestone mainly produces tires for passenger cars and trucks. The brand also makes specialty tires for aircraft, two-wheelers, and the agricultural sector. Known as the largest tire/rubber manufacturer on the planet with a presence in more than 150 countries Bridgestone is, indeed, an international company. They make the biggest profit in the Americas and Japan (43% and 26%, respectively). A post shared by Roman Tikhonov (@cyanide227) Michelin is the largest tire brand in Europe\u2014has been for quite some time now. And it\u2019s the second-largest manufacturer in the world.

If you own a vehicle and drive it at least once a week, you\u2019ve probably already replaced the factory tires. And, you know that they require regular maintenance and proper care. Crafted from hard rubber, car tires cover the wheels, support the weight of the car and ensure a smooth ride quality. But did you know that the tire market is predicted to reach $122 billion by 2026? This is quite a big and powerful industry, and today, we\u2019ll learn about the largest tire manufacturers this year. We\u2019ll go over the likes of Michelin, Bridgestone, Goodyear, and other world-famous brands to figure out which company is leading the market. So, what does the mightiest tire brand look like? Let\u2019s find out! A post shared by Meaty Fitment (@meaty.fitment) Headquartered in Tokyo, Bridgestone is leading the charge in 2021. This is achieved thanks to the impressive number of manufacturing plants (139 facilities in 24 countries) and employees (135,000 workers in various factories). Last year, the company made $29 billion, which is an absolute record for the tire industry. Bridgestone mainly produces tires for passenger cars and trucks. The brand also makes specialty tires for aircraft, two-wheelers, and the agricultural sector. Known as the largest tire/rubber manufacturer on the planet with a presence in more than 150 countries Bridgestone is, indeed, an international company. They make the biggest profit in the Americas and Japan (43% and 26%, respectively). A post shared by Roman Tikhonov (@cyanide227) Michelin is the largest tire brand in Europe\u2014has been for quite some time now. And it\u2019s the second-largest manufacturer in the world. Based in France, the company has 51 manufacturing plants in 18 countries and over 125,000 employees. In 2021, Michelin made $27 billion in revenue, which puts it slightly behind Bridgestone. This manufacturer\u2019s line-up includes tires of all shapes and sizes that fit pretty much any car out there, big or small. You\u2019ve probably seen their mascot once or twice or have heard about the Red Guide awards for restaurants. Founded back in 1889 by two brothers, today, it\u2019s a multi-billion brand. A post shared by Goodyear (@goodyear) With total revenue of 17.5 billion dollars, you could say that this manufacturer did, indeed, have a good year in 2021. Compared to Bridgestone and Michelin, it\u2019s not as big, even though it does have 48 plants in 21 countries. Now, Goodyear is one of the two US-based companies to make it into this list. Based in Ohio, it\u2019s been around since 1898. Cars, SUVs, commercial and light trucks, and earth-moving machinery\u2014this manufacturer produces it all. It managed to rise to the top thanks to its low-maintenance, easy-to-detach tires. And Goodyear is considered the most successful F1 supplier ever. The company was named after the man who created vulcanized rubber, Mr. Charles Goodyear. A post shared by Continental Tire (@continental_tire) Moving on with the list, we\u2019ve got Continental AG\u2014a German mogul that specializes in tires, brake systems, safety equipment, and chassis components. In 2021, the company\u2019s revenue was almost $40 billion! However, they only made $13 billion selling tires (it\u2019s one of Continental\u2019s six divisions), and that\u2019s why we put it on the #4 spot. This is still a very impressive result, especially given the number of facilities: 13. Continental is the fourth-largest tire producer in the world (and the second largest in Europe) and owns brands like Viking, Gislaved, and General, to name a few. Oh, and by the way, this is the oldest manufacturer on the list (founded in 1871). A post shared by G&M TYRES (@sbm_gmtyres) To stand out from the competition, Sumitomo focuses on advanced, forward-thinking technology. This brand\u2019s tires are long-lasting, easy to maintain, and highly reliable. That\u2019s especially true for their winter tires. Sumitomo Rubber Industries has been on the market for more than 100 years and has 40K employees working in 73 global facilities. The annual revenue for 2021 was almost $7 billion. That\u2019s more than four times less than what Bridgestone, a fellow Japanese company, made that same year. Nevertheless, SRI is a highly successful brand and has a strong foothold on the market, along with a stellar reputation.

The number of workers and production facilities is more than decent, and the brand is operating in 160 countries. Based in Milan, it mainly produces tires for bicycles, bikes, and, of course, cars. Pirelli makes premium-quality racing tires as well. Back in 2015, ChemChina took a controlling interest in the company. However, the Chinese mogul agreed to not change anything in the structure until 2023. More than that, the new investments allowed Pirelli to take tire production to the next level. A post shared by Hankook Brasil (@hankookbr) Known as one of the most trusted and renowned tire brands in Asia, Hankook is a South Korean company. Just like Sumitomo, it\u2019s all about innovative technology. By the way, Hankook translates as Korea, and it is a relatively new player on the market (founded in 1941) that doesn\u2019t have dozens of manufacturing plants (eight facilities in seven countries across the globe). With that said, clever marketing and top-notch production allow it to be the seventh-biggest tire company, manufacturing roughly around 100 million tires a year. Hankook made almost as much money in 2021 as Pirelli ($6.12 billion vs. $6.15) A post shared by WESTLAKE BARQUISIMETO (@westlake_barquisimeto) ZC Rubber (also known as the Zhongce Rubber Group) is a Chinese company. It only took it a decade or two to turn into a large-scale manufacturer. Now, every single ZC manufacturing plant is located in China\u201425 in total. And, they have 20,000 employees, more than enough to handle the production. GreatStar Group, a Chinese conglomerate, has a controlling interest in ZC shares, and thanks to its generous investments, the tire maker\u2019s revenue in 2021 reached 4.8 billion dollars a year. A post shared by Toni Zajakovski (@toni_zestino_aus) Going back to Japan, we have Yokohama, another Tokyo-based business. Established in 1917, it entered the American market in 1969, and that\u2019s when it turned into a truly global brand. Right now, Yokohama has 16 production facilities in seven countries and more than 27,000 workers, which allowed it to close 2021 with $4.1 billion in revenue. In Japan, Yokohama tires are mostly sold under the \u201cADVAN\u201d brand. These tires are highly rated as an aftermarket replacement. A post shared by Wake the signal up! (@6551east) Cheng Shin is the second-largest tire manufacturer after ZC Rubber. This is a Taiwan-based enterprise with annual revenue of $3.5\u20134 billion ($3.7 billion made in 2021). If you\u2019re a fan of the Maxxis or CST tires, just know that they are 100% owned by Cheng Shin Rubber. Employing over 20,000 people, CSR is the top producer of bicycle tires on the planet, distributing its product to 150 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

They excel at commercial truck tires that are praised worldwide for their stellar performance and extended lifespan. Toyo\u2019s engineers are constantly looking for new ways to improve the original \u201cformula\u201d. That helps the brand not just to stay afloat but run a successful business ($2.9 billion in their \u201cpocket\u201d in 2021). A post shared by Cooper Tires Philippines (@coopertiresph) Competitively priced and easy to maintain, the Cooper Tires are available for trucks, SUVs, minivans, and motorcycles. With more than 100 years of experience behind its back, this company knows exactly how to appeal to its target audience. The production scale isn\u2019t chart-topping (10 plants in six countries; 10,000 employees). Yet, despite the pandemic and the economic crisis, Cooper\u2019s revenue last year was $2.8 billion. A post shared by Apollo Tyres (@apollotyresltd) Founded in 1972, Apollo Tyres, an Indian manufacturer, quickly rose to stardom thanks to big investments, advanced technological solutions, and strong management. Mostly based in India (five plants), Apollo also has facilities in Hungary and the Netherlands. These are rather big facilities, though, as 19,000 people are working there. Revenue of $2.7 billion makes Apollo one of the largest tire manufacturers of our time. A post shared by MRF Tyres (@mrf\n\nquestion: Why does LEGO Group hold the title of largest tire manufacturer per year?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1106}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Leading Tire Manufacturers: Bridgestone, LEGO Group, and Michelin\n\nevidence: corporate) MRF is constantly competing with Apollo for the title of the largest tire manufacturer in India. In 2021, it fell slightly behind with $2.2 billion vs. $2.7. The number of manufacturing plants is higher, though (10 in total), but they\u2019re all located in India. The Madras Rubber Factory makes paints, toys, treads, and tires. It started out making balloons, but in 1952 the focus switched to rubber. A post shared by Auto Life (@autolife.jp) With just five facilities in three countries, Nokian Tyres still managed to make it into the list. The number of employees is quite low, too (compared to the competition), but that didn\u2019t stop this company from making 2 billion American dollars in 2021. This is the youngest tire manufacturer, by the way\u2014it was established in 1988 and is only 34 years old. Based in the Finnish town of the same name, Nokian Tyres operates in 130 countries. The short answer is rubber, and back in the day, the so-called \u201crubber trees\u201d were the sole source for it. However, with the demand for latex rising exponentially and mass deforestation in South America turning into a problem, it was clear that the industry was in need of an alternative. In 1909 Fritz Hofmann, a German chemist, introduced the concept of synthetic rubber. And 22 years later (in 1931, to be exact), a US-based company started large-scale synthetic rubber production. These days, car tires are a combination of both (24% synthetic and 19% natural rubber) mixed in with steel and fillers. This makes it possible to keep production costs low and eliminate the chance of shortages on the market. It all comes down to how much you\u2019re willing to pay. For example, an entry-level tire will cost you $50\u2013$150. If you have the budget for a decent-quality tire, be ready to pay $120\u2013$300. As for premium-quality \u201crubber\u201d, it usually costs $350\u2013$1,000. On average, US drivers pay $500\u2013$750 for a full set (four tires). Are you an avid off-roader and competitive driver? Then you might want to save a bit and get high-end, performance-oriented tires. The reason: the less expensive ones will wear out soon, especially if you constantly drive over rough terrain. In contrast, for everyday driving, cheap tires will be the right choice. They are affordable yet last for more than a couple of years. This depends on the car, your driving habits, the area that you live in, and maintenance. A decent-quality set of tires will serve you for 3\u20135 years, which equals 45\u201375K miles. The NHTSA doesn\u2019t have any strict recommendations, while manufacturers claim their tires last for at least 6\u201310 years. In any case, you should run regular checks for signs of wear, tear, cracks, low air pressure, misalignment, and other issues. Natural elements can also have a huge negative impact. Now, tires that have been around for more than 10 years are a disaster waiting to happen. First, they\u2019ll be too weak to support the weight of the vehicle. Second, no matter how good you are at maintenance, the rubber won\u2019t be able to perform at quite the same level it used to. We recommend having the tires checked thoroughly by a mechanic once you reach the 6\u20138 year threshold. As far as the most important parts of any modern-day vehicle go, tires are right there on top of the list. You simply won\u2019t be able to drive your car without a proper tire set!

By the way, Hankook translates as Korea, and it is a relatively new player on the market (founded in 1941) that doesn\u2019t have dozens of manufacturing plants (eight facilities in seven countries across the globe). With that said, clever marketing and top-notch production allow it to be the seventh-biggest tire company, manufacturing roughly around 100 million tires a year. Hankook made almost as much money in 2021 as Pirelli ($6.12 billion vs. $6.15) A post shared by WESTLAKE BARQUISIMETO (@westlake_barquisimeto) ZC Rubber (also known as the Zhongce Rubber Group) is a Chinese company. It only took it a decade or two to turn into a large-scale manufacturer. Now, every single ZC manufacturing plant is located in China\u201425 in total. And, they have 20,000 employees, more than enough to handle the production. GreatStar Group, a Chinese conglomerate, has a controlling interest in ZC shares, and thanks to its generous investments, the tire maker\u2019s revenue in 2021 reached 4.8 billion dollars a year. A post shared by Toni Zajakovski (@toni_zestino_aus) Going back to Japan, we have Yokohama, another Tokyo-based business. Established in 1917, it entered the American market in 1969, and that\u2019s when it turned into a truly global brand. Right now, Yokohama has 16 production facilities in seven countries and more than 27,000 workers, which allowed it to close 2021 with $4.1 billion in revenue. In Japan, Yokohama tires are mostly sold under the \u201cADVAN\u201d brand. These tires are highly rated as an aftermarket replacement. A post shared by Wake the signal up!

A post shared by Cooper Tires Philippines (@coopertiresph) Competitively priced and easy to maintain, the Cooper Tires are available for trucks, SUVs, minivans, and motorcycles.

A post shared by Apollo Tyres (@apollotyresltd) Founded in 1972, Apollo Tyres, an Indian manufacturer, quickly rose to stardom thanks to big investments, advanced technological solutions, and strong management. Mostly based in India (five plants), Apollo also has facilities in Hungary and the Netherlands. These are rather big facilities, though, as 19,000 people are working there.

In 2021, it fell slightly behind with $2.2 billion vs. $2.7. The number of manufacturing plants is higher, though (10 in total), but they\u2019re all located in India. The Madras Rubber Factory makes paints, toys, treads, and tires. It started out making balloons, but in 1952 the focus switched to rubber. A post shared by Auto Life (@autolife.jp) With just five facilities in three countries, Nokian Tyres still managed to make it into the list. The number of employees is quite low, too (compared to the competition), but that didn\u2019t stop this company from making 2 billion American dollars in 2021. This is the youngest tire manufacturer, by the way\u2014it was established in 1988 and is only 34 years old. Based in the Finnish town of the same name, Nokian Tyres operates in 130 countries. The short answer is rubber, and back in the day, the so-called \u201crubber trees\u201d were the sole source for it. However, with the demand for latex rising exponentially and mass deforestation in South America turning into a problem, it was clear that the industry was in need of an alternative. In 1909 Fritz Hofmann, a German chemist, introduced the concept of synthetic rubber. And 22 years later (in 1931, to be exact), a US-based company started large-scale synthetic rubber production. These days, car tires are a combination of both (24% synthetic and 19% natural rubber) mixed in with steel and fillers. This makes it possible to keep production costs low and eliminate the chance of shortages on the market. It all comes down to how much you\u2019re willing to pay. For example, an entry-level tire will cost you $50\u2013$150. If you have the budget for a decent-quality tire, be ready to pay $120\u2013$300. As for premium-quality \u201crubber\u201d, it usually costs $350\u2013$1,000. On average, US drivers pay $500\u2013$750 for a full set (four tires). Are you an avid off-roader and competitive driver? Then you might want to save a bit and get high-end, performance-oriented tires. The reason: the less expensive ones will wear out soon, especially if you constantly drive over rough terrain. In contrast, for everyday driving, cheap tires will be the right choice. They are affordable yet last for more than a couple of years. This depends on the car, your driving habits, the area that you live in, and maintenance. A decent-quality set of tires will serve you for 3\u20135 years, which equals 45\u201375K miles. The NHTSA doesn\u2019t have any strict recommendations, while manufacturers claim their tires last for at least 6\u201310 years. In any case, you should run regular checks for signs of wear, tear, cracks, low air pressure, misalignment, and other issues. Natural elements can also have a huge negative impact. Now, tires that have been around for more than 10 years are a disaster waiting to happen. First, they\u2019ll be too weak to support the weight of the vehicle. Second, no matter how good you are at maintenance, the rubber won\u2019t be able to perform at quite the same level it used to. We recommend having the tires checked thoroughly by a mechanic once you reach the 6\u20138 year threshold. As far as the most important parts of any modern-day vehicle go, tires are right there on top of the list. You simply won\u2019t be able to drive your car without a proper tire set! This is a gigantic industry, with multi-billion companies fighting to win over customers. This year, low-cost manufacturing and high demand are anticipated to drive tire production to an all-time high. Today, we checked out 15 best-selling tire brands to find the biggest manufacturer. So, if you only want to trust the #1 brand with your tires, now you know which company to go with! Just make sure to have the tires checked regularly, keep them properly aligned, and don\u2019t overload the vehicle.

If you own a vehicle and drive it at least once a week, you\u2019ve probably already replaced the factory tires. And, you know that they require regular maintenance and proper care. Crafted from hard rubber, car tires cover the wheels, support the weight of the car and ensure a smooth ride quality. But did you know that the tire market is predicted to reach $122 billion by 2026? This is quite a big and powerful industry, and today, we\u2019ll learn about the largest tire manufacturers this year. We\u2019ll go over the likes of Michelin, Bridgestone, Goodyear, and other world-famous brands to figure out which company is leading the market. So, what does the mightiest tire brand look like? Let\u2019s find out! A post shared by Meaty Fitment (@meaty.fitment) Headquartered in Tokyo, Bridgestone is leading the charge in 2021. This is achieved thanks to the impressive number of manufacturing plants (139 facilities in 24 countries) and employees (135,000 workers in various factories). Last year, the company made $29 billion, which is an absolute record for the tire industry. Bridgestone mainly produces tires for passenger cars and trucks. The brand also makes specialty tires for aircraft, two-wheelers, and the agricultural sector. Known as the largest tire/rubber manufacturer on the planet with a presence in more than 150 countries Bridgestone is, indeed, an international company. They make the biggest profit in the Americas and Japan (43% and 26%, respectively). A post shared by Roman Tikhonov (@cyanide227) Michelin is the largest tire brand in Europe\u2014has been for quite some time now. And it\u2019s the second-largest manufacturer in the world. Based in France, the company has 51 manufacturing plants in 18 countries and over 125,000 employees. In 2021, Michelin made $27 billion in revenue, which puts it slightly behind Bridgestone. This manufacturer\u2019s line-up includes tires of all shapes and sizes that fit pretty much any car out there, big or small. You\u2019ve probably seen their mascot once or twice or have heard about the Red Guide awards for restaurants. Founded back in 1889 by two brothers, today, it\u2019s a multi-billion brand. A post shared by Goodyear (@goodyear) With total revenue of 17.5 billion dollars, you could say that this manufacturer did, indeed, have a good year in 2021. Compared to Bridgestone and Michelin, it\u2019s not as big, even though it does have 48 plants in 21 countries. Now, Goodyear is one of the two US-based companies to make it into this list. Based in Ohio, it\u2019s been around since 1898. Cars, SUVs, commercial and light trucks, and earth-moving machinery\u2014this manufacturer produces it all. It managed to rise to the top thanks to its low-maintenance, easy-to-detach tires. And Goodyear is considered the most successful F1 supplier ever. The company was named after the man who created vulcanized rubber, Mr. Charles Goodyear. A post shared by Continental Tire (@continental_tire) Moving on with the list, we\u2019ve got Continental AG\u2014a German mogul that specializes in tires, brake systems, safety equipment, and chassis components. In 2021, the company\u2019s revenue was almost $40 billion! However, they only made $13 billion selling tires (it\u2019s one of Continental\u2019s six divisions), and that\u2019s why we put it on the #4 spot. This is still a very impressive result, especially given the number of facilities: 13. Continental is the fourth-largest tire producer in the world (and the second largest in Europe) and owns brands like Viking, Gislaved, and General, to name a few. Oh, and by the way, this is the oldest manufacturer on the list (founded in 1871). A post shared by G&M TYRES (@sbm_gmtyres) To stand out from the competition, Sumitomo focuses on advanced, forward-thinking technology. This brand\u2019s tires are long-lasting, easy to maintain, and highly reliable. That\u2019s especially true for their winter tires. Sumitomo Rubber Industries has been on the market for more than 100 years and has 40K employees working in 73 global facilities. The annual revenue for 2021 was almost $7 billion. That\u2019s more than four times less than what Bridgestone, a fellow Japanese company, made that same year. Nevertheless, SRI is a highly successful brand and has a strong foothold on the market, along with a stellar reputation.

The number of workers and production facilities is more than decent, and the brand is operating in 160 countries. Based in Milan, it mainly produces tires for bicycles, bikes, and, of course, cars. Pirelli makes premium-quality racing tires as well. Back in 2015, ChemChina took a controlling interest in the company. However, the Chinese mogul agreed to not change anything in the structure until 2023. More than that, the new investments allowed Pirelli to take tire production to the next level.

That\u2019s over 870,000 tires being made each day! While one would assume this award goes to one of the tires commonly seen on the road like Bridgestone or Goodyear, it might be a surprise to know it\u2019s actually LEGO Group. That\u2019s right, the Guinness World Record holder for \u201clargest tire manufacturer per year\u201d goes to LEGO. The honor was bestowed on them in 2012. The huge amount of tires created every year is because nearly half of all LEGO sets include wheels of some sort. This wasn\u2019t always the case, though. LEGO tires are a relatively recent creation. They were introduced in in 1962, in set number 400, which went on to be the best selling LEGO set in 1967.

If you own a vehicle and drive it at least once a week, you\u2019ve probably already replaced the factory tires. And, you know that they require regular maintenance and proper care. Crafted from hard rubber, car tires cover the wheels, support the weight of the car and ensure a smooth ride quality. But did you know that the tire market is predicted to reach $122 billion by 2026? This is quite a big and powerful industry, and today, we\u2019ll learn about the largest tire manufacturers this year. We\u2019ll go over the likes of Michelin, Bridgestone, Goodyear, and other world-famous brands to figure out which company is leading the market. So, what does the mightiest tire brand look like? Let\u2019s find out! A post shared by Meaty Fitment (@meaty.fitment) Headquartered in Tokyo, Bridgestone is leading the charge in 2021. This is achieved thanks to the impressive number of manufacturing plants (139 facilities in 24 countries) and employees (135,000 workers in various factories). Last year, the company made $29 billion, which is an absolute record for the tire industry. Bridgestone mainly produces tires for passenger cars and trucks. The brand also makes specialty tires for aircraft, two-wheelers, and the agricultural sector. Known as the largest tire/rubber manufacturer on the planet with a presence in more than 150 countries Bridgestone is, indeed, an international company. They make the biggest profit in the Americas and Japan (43% and 26%, respectively). A post shared by Roman Tikhonov (@cyanide227) Michelin is the largest tire brand in Europe\u2014has been for quite some time now. And it\u2019s the second-largest manufacturer in the world. Based in France, the company has 51 manufacturing plants in 18 countries and over 125,000 employees. In 2021, Michelin made $27 billion in revenue, which puts it slightly behind Bridgestone. This manufacturer\u2019s line-up includes tires of all shapes and sizes that fit pretty much any car out there, big or small. You\u2019ve probably seen their mascot once or twice or have heard about the Red Guide awards for restaurants. Founded back in 1889 by two brothers, today, it\u2019s a multi-billion brand. A post shared by Goodyear (@goodyear) With total revenue of 17.5 billion dollars, you could say that this manufacturer did, indeed, have a good year in 2021. Compared to Bridgestone and Michelin, it\u2019s not as big, even though it does have 48 plants in 21 countries. Now, Goodyear is one of the two US-based companies to make it into this list. Based in Ohio, it\u2019s been around since 1898. Cars, SUVs, commercial and light trucks, and earth-moving machinery\u2014this manufacturer produces it all. It managed to rise to the top thanks to its low-maintenance, easy-to-detach tires. And Goodyear is considered the most successful F1 supplier ever. The company was named after the man who created vulcanized rubber, Mr. Charles Goodyear. A post shared by Continental Tire (@continental_tire) Moving on with the list, we\u2019ve got Continental AG\u2014a German mogul that specializes in tires, brake systems, safety equipment, and chassis components. In 2021, the company\u2019s revenue was almost $40 billion! However, they only made $13 billion selling tires (it\u2019s one of Continental\u2019s six divisions), and that\u2019s why we put it on the #4 spot. This is still a very impressive result, especially given the number of facilities: 13. Continental is the fourth-largest tire producer in the world (and the second largest in Europe) and owns brands like Viking, Gislaved, and General, to name a few. Oh, and by the way, this is the oldest manufacturer on the list (founded in 1871). A post shared by G&M TYRES (@sbm_gmtyres) To stand out from the competition, Sumitomo focuses on advanced, forward-thinking technology. This brand\u2019s tires are long-lasting, easy to maintain, and highly reliable. That\u2019s especially true for their winter tires. Sumitomo Rubber Industries has been on the market for more than 100 years and has 40K employees working in 73 global facilities. The annual revenue for 2021 was almost $7 billion. That\u2019s more than four times less than what Bridgestone, a fellow Japanese company, made that same year. Nevertheless, SRI is a highly successful brand and has a strong foothold on the market, along with a stellar reputation.

The number of workers and production facilities is more than decent, and the brand is operating in 160 countries. Based in Milan, it mainly produces tires for bicycles, bikes, and, of course, cars. Pirelli makes premium-quality racing tires as well. Back in 2015, ChemChina took a controlling interest in the company. However, the Chinese mogul agreed to not change anything in the structure until 2023. More than that, the new investments allowed Pirelli to take tire production to the next level. A post shared by Hankook Brasil (@hankookbr) Known as one of the most trusted and renowned tire brands in Asia, Hankook is a South Korean company. Just like Sumitomo, it\u2019s all about innovative technology. By the way, Hankook translates as Korea, and it is a relatively new player on the market (founded in 1941) that doesn\u2019t have dozens of manufacturing plants (eight facilities in seven countries across the globe). With that said, clever marketing and top-notch production allow it to be the seventh-biggest tire company, manufacturing roughly around 100 million tires a year. Hankook made almost as much money in 2021 as Pirelli ($6.12 billion vs. $6.15) A post shared by WESTLAKE BARQUISIMETO (@westlake_barquisimeto) ZC Rubber (also known as the Zhongce Rubber Group) is a Chinese company. It only took it a decade or two to turn into a large-scale manufacturer. Now, every single ZC manufacturing plant is located in China\u201425 in total. And, they have 20,000 employees, more than enough to handle the production. GreatStar Group, a Chinese conglomerate, has a controlling interest in ZC shares, and thanks to its generous investments, the tire maker\u2019s revenue in 2021 reached 4.8 billion dollars a year. A post shared by Toni Zajakovski (@toni_zestino_aus) Going back to Japan, we have Yokohama, another Tokyo-based business. Established in 1917, it entered the American market in 1969, and that\u2019s when it turned into a truly global brand. Right now, Yokohama has 16 production facilities in seven countries and more than 27,000 workers, which allowed it to close 2021 with $4.1 billion in revenue. In Japan, Yokohama tires are mostly sold under the \u201cADVAN\u201d brand. These tires are highly rated as an aftermarket replacement. A post shared by Wake the signal up! (@6551east) Cheng Shin is the second-largest tire manufacturer after ZC Rubber. This is a Taiwan-based enterprise with annual revenue of $3.5\u20134 billion ($3.7 billion made in 2021). If you\u2019re a fan of the Maxxis or CST tires, just know that they are 100% owned by Cheng Shin Rubber. Employing over 20,000 people, CSR is the top producer of bicycle tires on the planet, distributing its product to 150 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. A post shared by \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude54\ud835\ude4a \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude4e (@toyotires) Toyo Tires positions itself as a tire and rubber products company. They excel at commercial truck tires that are praised worldwide for their stellar performance and extended lifespan. Toyo\u2019s engineers are constantly looking for new ways to improve the original \u201cformula\u201d. That helps the brand not just to stay afloat but run a successful business ($2.9 billion in their \u201cpocket\u201d in 2021). A post shared by Cooper Tires Philippines (@coopertiresph) Competitively priced and easy to maintain, the Cooper Tires are available for trucks, SUVs, minivans, and motorcycles. With more than 100 years of experience behind its back, this company knows exactly how to appeal to its target audience. The production scale isn\u2019t chart-topping (10 plants in six countries; 10,000 employees). Yet, despite the pandemic and the economic crisis, Cooper\u2019s revenue last year was $2.8 billion. A post shared by Apollo Tyres (@apollotyresltd) Founded in 1972, Apollo Tyres, an Indian manufacturer, quickly rose to stardom thanks to big investments, advanced technological solutions, and strong management. Mostly based in India (five plants), Apollo also has facilities in Hungary and the Netherlands. These are rather big facilities, though, as 19,000 people are working there. Revenue of $2.7 billion makes Apollo one of the largest tire manufacturers of our time. A post shared by MRF Tyres (@mrf\n\nquestion: How much revenue did Michelin make in 2021?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1104}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Leading Tire Manufacturers: Bridgestone, LEGO Group, and Michelin\n\nevidence: corporate) MRF is constantly competing with Apollo for the title of the largest tire manufacturer in India. In 2021, it fell slightly behind with $2.2 billion vs. $2.7. The number of manufacturing plants is higher, though (10 in total), but they\u2019re all located in India. The Madras Rubber Factory makes paints, toys, treads, and tires. It started out making balloons, but in 1952 the focus switched to rubber. A post shared by Auto Life (@autolife.jp) With just five facilities in three countries, Nokian Tyres still managed to make it into the list. The number of employees is quite low, too (compared to the competition), but that didn\u2019t stop this company from making 2 billion American dollars in 2021. This is the youngest tire manufacturer, by the way\u2014it was established in 1988 and is only 34 years old. Based in the Finnish town of the same name, Nokian Tyres operates in 130 countries. The short answer is rubber, and back in the day, the so-called \u201crubber trees\u201d were the sole source for it. However, with the demand for latex rising exponentially and mass deforestation in South America turning into a problem, it was clear that the industry was in need of an alternative. In 1909 Fritz Hofmann, a German chemist, introduced the concept of synthetic rubber. And 22 years later (in 1931, to be exact), a US-based company started large-scale synthetic rubber production. These days, car tires are a combination of both (24% synthetic and 19% natural rubber) mixed in with steel and fillers. This makes it possible to keep production costs low and eliminate the chance of shortages on the market. It all comes down to how much you\u2019re willing to pay. For example, an entry-level tire will cost you $50\u2013$150. If you have the budget for a decent-quality tire, be ready to pay $120\u2013$300. As for premium-quality \u201crubber\u201d, it usually costs $350\u2013$1,000. On average, US drivers pay $500\u2013$750 for a full set (four tires). Are you an avid off-roader and competitive driver? Then you might want to save a bit and get high-end, performance-oriented tires. The reason: the less expensive ones will wear out soon, especially if you constantly drive over rough terrain. In contrast, for everyday driving, cheap tires will be the right choice. They are affordable yet last for more than a couple of years. This depends on the car, your driving habits, the area that you live in, and maintenance. A decent-quality set of tires will serve you for 3\u20135 years, which equals 45\u201375K miles. The NHTSA doesn\u2019t have any strict recommendations, while manufacturers claim their tires last for at least 6\u201310 years. In any case, you should run regular checks for signs of wear, tear, cracks, low air pressure, misalignment, and other issues. Natural elements can also have a huge negative impact. Now, tires that have been around for more than 10 years are a disaster waiting to happen. First, they\u2019ll be too weak to support the weight of the vehicle. Second, no matter how good you are at maintenance, the rubber won\u2019t be able to perform at quite the same level it used to. We recommend having the tires checked thoroughly by a mechanic once you reach the 6\u20138 year threshold. As far as the most important parts of any modern-day vehicle go, tires are right there on top of the list. You simply won\u2019t be able to drive your car without a proper tire set! This is a gigantic industry, with multi-billion companies fighting to win over customers. This year, low-cost manufacturing and high demand are anticipated to drive tire production to an all-time high. Today, we checked out 15 best-selling tire brands to find the biggest manufacturer. So, if you only want to trust the #1 brand with your tires, now you know which company to go with! Just make sure to have the tires checked regularly, keep them properly aligned, and don\u2019t overload the vehicle.
