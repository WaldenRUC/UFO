Our editors will review what you\u2019ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. The Eastern Front was a major theatre of combat during World War I that included operations on the main Russian front as well as campaigns in Romania. The main front was divided into three \u201csub-theatres\u201d\u2014with campaigns in the German province of East Prussia in the north, Austrian Galicia in the south, and the Russian-held Polish salient in between\u2014each of which had its own unique characteristics. The Eastern Front stretched across eastern Europe from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south. This was a span of some 800 miles (roughly 1,300 km) in a direct line\u2014or more than twice that distance if measured along the borders between the opposing countries. On the Eastern Front, Germany and other members of the Central Powers, such as Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, fought against Russia and Romania of the Allied and Associated Powers. While much of the fighting on the Western Front was characterized by trench warfare and stalemates, fighting on the Eastern Front was more conventional, involving fluid movements of armies in massive offensives and counteroffensives. Fighting on the Eastern Front ended on March 3, 1918, when a peace treaty between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers was signed at Brest-Litovsk. To understand why the treaty was signed, one must go back to early 1917. Military defeats and economic instability had shaken the Russian Empire and led to the fall, in February 1917, of Tsar Nicholas II\u2019s government. This government was replaced by a short-lived Provisional Government. On October 24\u201325 (November 6\u20137, New Style) Vladimir Lenin\u2019s Bolsheviks and their Left Socialist Revolutionary allies staged a coup d'\u00e9tat, later called the Bolshevik Revolution. One day after taking power, Lenin published two decrees that dissolved the Eastern Front overnight, increased chaos in Russia, and made very difficult any organized resistance to communist rule. His Land Decree, which abolished landed estates without compensation to their owners, drew Russian soldiers away from the front line and back to their home villages. His Peace Decree offered the peoples of all the belligerent states peace negotiations on the basis that there should be no annexations and no indemnities and that the right of self-determination should be recognized for all. On November 26, 1917, the Soviet of People\u2019s Commissars, as the new communist government was called, unilaterally ordered the cessation of hostilities on Russia\u2019s European and Transcaucasian fronts. Russia\u2019s armistice with the Central Powers was signed on December 15, 1917. Subsequently, however, Germany pushed for Russia to accept the Central Powers\u2019 peace terms by launching its armies into the newly constituted Ukrainian National Republic, across the armistice lines in Belorussia and Latvia, and even into Estonia. This forced Lenin\u2019s hand, and the peace treaty was signed on March 3, 1918. As a result, Russia recognized both Finland and Ukraine as independent; renounced control over Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and most of Belorussia; and ceded Kars, Ardahan, and Batumi in Transcaucasia to the Ottoman Empire. Eastern Front, major theatre of combat during World War I that included operations on the main Russian front as well as campaigns in Romania. The principal belligerents were Russia and Romania (of the Allied and Associated Powers) versus the Central Powers countries of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria. The Eastern Front, which stretched from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south, was more than twice as long as the Western Front. The greater distances and greater differences between the equipment and quality of the armies involved ensured a fluidity of combat which was lacking in the west. In August 1914 the Russian and Austro-Hungarian\u2013German armies faced each other across a frontier that stretched over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from the Baltic Sea to the northern border of Romania, which was at that time neutral. This great length was due to the projection of Russian Poland as a huge salient between German East Prussia and Austrian Galicia. After Romania joined in the war on the side of the Allies in 1916, the front extended from the Baltic to the Black Sea, a span of some 800 miles (roughly 1,300 km) in a direct line, or more than twice that distance if measured along the borders between the opposing countries. The shape of the frontier, the great distances, and the physical features and nature of the communications combined to divide the Eastern Front into three \u201csub-theatres\u201d until the Russian retreat out of Poland in 1915. Thus, the operations in East Prussia, in the Polish salient, and in Galicia, though they formed part of a combined whole, each had their own special characteristics.

The only heights sufficient to constitute a serious military obstacle were the Carpathians, which extended in a semicircle from the southwest corner of the Polish salient to the Iron Gate on the Danube, forming a protective barrier for the Hungarian plains on the north and east. Opposite Russia they ran roughly parallel to the frontier, some 50\u2013100 miles (80\u2013160 km) from it; opposite Romania the Carpathians actually marked the frontier. It was a constant aim of the Russians throughout their operations, as well as the objective of Romania\u2019s single abortive offensive, to pierce this barrier and reach the plains below. Although the Eastern Front had but a single notable mountain barrier, the water obstacles in the theatre were numerous and formidable. The most significant from a strategic standpoint was the Pripet Marshes, a vast waterlogged wetland covering approximately 104,000 square miles (270,000 square km), where infrastructure was undeveloped and military movements on a large scale were extremely difficult in consequence. Other water lines which had a considerable effect on operations were: in East Prussia, the line of the Masurian lakes; in the Polish salient, the rivers Vistula, Narew, Bobr, Niemen, and Bug; in Galicia, the Dunajec, Wis\u0142ok, San, and Dniester; and in the Romanian theatre, the Danube itself, the Olt, and the Siret. Besides the rivers enumerated above, there were a number of lesser streams which influenced the course and direction of the operations. Strategy in this theatre was in fact largely determined by rivers. Rivers slow the movement of an advancing army but are seldom a permanent bar to its progress. Although many of the principal river crossings had been fortified in peace, these fortifications had little influence on the course of operations\u2014except, notably, at Przemy\u015bl. In East Prussia and in Poland were extensive stretches of forest, which had certain tactical consequences. The Carpathians also were thickly wooded. The real key to strategy on this eastern European front lay in the communications and logistics systems. In this respect the contrast between Russia and its western neighbours was striking. The transportation system in Russia was extremely underdeveloped, in spite of all efforts in the years preceding the war to develop strategic railways. The Russian general staff had prevented road or railway construction in the north and in the southeast of the Polish salient in order to provide protection to a defensive position in the centre of the salient. This shortsighted policy seriously hampered Russian strategy when an offensive campaign from Poland was undertaken. Nor could Russia make much use of its great rivers as lines of supply, owing to lack of previous development. Thus, superior command and communications infrastructure gave Russia\u2019s adversaries the inestimable advantage of greater mobility. The armies that met on the Eastern Front were all conscript forces. Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Germany required three to four years of service from able-bodied males of military age, to be followed by several years in reserve formations. Military strength was counted in terms of divisions (12,000\u201320,000 officers and men), the smallest military units capable of independent action. In August 1914 the Russian army consisted of 102 regular divisions divided into six field armies, boasting a total manpower of some 1.4 million. Germany\u2019s eight field armies consisted of 98 regular divisions, supplemented by 27 Landwehr (reserve) brigades, for a total strength of 1.9 million men; although this force was significantly larger than Russia\u2019s army, it would have to be deployed on two fronts. Austria-Hungary\u2019s six field armies were divided into 48 divisions, with a total manpower of some 450,000. Of the Germans little else need be said; their army of 1914 was among the most powerful instruments of war the world had yet seen. The raw material of the Russian army was in many ways excellent. The typical Russian infantryman was noted for his discipline and bravery, but he often lacked leadership, as the army did not possess a deep well of officers and senior enlisted men from which to draw. Once the original cadre of regular officers and noncommissioned officers had fallen, there were few candidates to replace them, because the Russian system did not produce reserve officers with great efficiency. The Russian army was very weak on the technical side; it was lacking in artillery, and it fielded large masses of cavalry, provision for which threw a great strain on the communications and logistics systems, but which accomplished little. In no way\u2014except by weight of numbers\u2014could a Russian army hope to gain the advantage over a German force. The Austro-Hungarian army, only slightly, if at all, superior to the Russian on the technical side, was inferior to it in fighting quality. This was in large part due to a senior officer corps that was mediocre at best. Austro-Hungarian troops\n\nquestion: What was the Eastern Front in World War I?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "It was a theatre of operations during World War I that stretched along the strategic Carpathian Mountains and included several key rivers and marshes.", "usage": 1138}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A Russian force was almost always the master of an Austro-Hungarian force of similar size, but it required a great numerical preponderance to meet a force of Germans with any hope of success. The high state of discipline, training, leadership, and armament of the German army reduced the significance of the initial numerical inferiority of the armies of the Central Powers. Due to the comparative slowness of mobilization, poor higher leadership, and lower scale of armament of the Russian armies, there was an approximate balance of forces in August 1914 which prevented one side from gaining a quick victory. The Russian military expert Gen. Nikolai N. Golovin rated one German division as the equivalent of one and a half Russian divisions. Germany and Austria-Hungary also enjoyed the advantage of interior lines of communication which enabled them to send their forces to critical points on the battlefronts by the shortest route. According to Gen. Wilhelm Groener, Germany\u2019s railway network made it possible to move eight divisions simultaneously from the Western Front to the Eastern Front in four and a half days. Even greater in importance was the advantage that Germany derived from military traditions and a system of command dating back to the reforms of Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst, Count Neidhardt von Gneisenau, Count von Roon, and the elder Helmuth von Moltke. Skilled in directing a war of movement and quick to exploit the advantages of flank attacks, German senior officers, with the exception of Moltke\u2019s namesake nephew, were capable of successfully directing the operations of large formations. The German plan of 1914 was a modification of one drawn up by Alfred von Schlieffen many years previously. It provided for an offensive against France designed to obtain a rapid and decisive victory and a defensive in the east against Russia until the decision had been obtained in the west. The choice of France for the initial offensive was actuated chiefly by the relative slowness of Russian mobilization and by the impossibility of gaining a rapid decision against Russia owing to the great distances. Germany\u2019s problem in the east was then to determine the minimum strength to be left for defensive purposes. This was eventually fixed at nine divisions, active and reserve, with one cavalry division, for the protection of East Prussia. Certain second-line troops were tasked with the defense of the Eastern Front fortresses such as Posen (now Pozna\u0144, Poland), Thorn (now Toru\u0144, Poland), Danzig (now Gda\u0144sk, Poland), and Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) and to watch the Polish frontier. The troops in East Prussia, organized into four corps, formed the Eighth Army under Max von Prittwitz. The chief of the Austro-Hungarian general staff, Franz, Graf Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, had planned an offensive into southeast Poland between the Vistula and Bug rivers, directed at Che\u0142m and Lublin. This was to be carried out by the First and Fourth armies (under Gen. Viktor Dankl and Gen. Moritz von Auffenberg, respectively). To protect their right flank and rear, the Second and Third armies (under Gen. Hermann K\u00f6vess and Gen. Rudolf von Brudermann) deployed east of Halicz and Lemberg. Conrad\u2019s offensive was originally designed as part of a combined Austro-Hungarian\u2013German offensive, in which German forces from East Prussia were simultaneously to attack along the Narew River. German and Austro-Hungarian forces were to meet about Siedlce and thus cut off the whole Polish salient. Conrad had repeatedly urged this plan on Moltke but had failed to induce him to provide sufficient troops to take the offensive from East Prussia, before France had been disposed of. In the absence of German cooperation, it is difficult to see what permanent success Conrad could have hoped for from the proposed Che\u0142m-Lublin offensive, because, as already pointed out, the Russians had neglected the infrastructure in that area expressly to frustrate the operation he had chosen. From the German point of view, however, this Austro-Hungarian offensive fitted in admirably with their strategic plan, because, whatever its outcome, it would keep the Russians fully engaged and thus safeguard the vital industrial areas of Silesia, until the campaign against France had been won. The Russians had accurately gauged the intentions of both their adversaries. Their original plan was to take the offensive against the Austro-Hungarian armies in Galicia and to act defensively in the Polish salient and against the Germans in East Prussia. They were, however, pledged to their French allies to assume the offensive against Germany at the earliest possible date. Six armies were initially deployed along the front line. The First (or Vilna) Army under Gen. Paul von Rennenkampf assembled on the eastern frontier of East Prussia, and\n\nquestion: What was the Eastern Front in World War I?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Eastern Front in World War I was the front line between the German and Austro-Hungarian armies and the Russian army.", "usage": 1126}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

These two armies formed the Northwestern Front, under Gen. Yakov Grigoryevich Zhilinsky. They were intended for action against the German forces in East Prussia. The Southwestern Front, under Gen. Nikolai Ivanov, consisted of four armies, of which the Fourth (under Gen. Anton Salza) and Fifth (under Gen. Paul von Plehwe) were to deploy on the Lublin-Che\u0142m railway to meet the expected Austro-Hungarian offensive; the Third Army (Gen. Nikolai Ruzski) and Eighth Army (Gen. Aleksey Brusilov) were to take the offensive at once from the eastern frontier of Galicia in the direction of Lemberg (now Lviv, Ukraine). The Austro-Hungarian and Russian plans were almost the exact counterpart of each other. Grand Duke Nicholas assumed chief command of the Russian armies as a whole. Though no great strategist, he was shrewd and had a strong personality. His chief of staff, Gen. Nikolai Yanushkevich, was a man of no significant military ability who owed his position to his charisma at court. The Russian war plan was attributed mainly to Gen. Yuri Danilov, head of the operations branch of the general staff. In addition to the front line armies, the Sixth Army was assembled at Petrograd for the protection of the capital and as a general reserve, the Seventh Army at Odessa to guard the Black Sea coast, and an army in the Caucasus to watch Turkey. At the last moment, after mobilization, a momentous change in the Russian dispositions was made. The First and Second armies were ordered to invade East Prussia at once, without waiting to complete their concentration. This change was made solely to assist Russia\u2019s allies in the west. Rennenkampf\u2019s First Army comprised six and a half infantry divisions and five cavalry divisions, and Samsonov\u2019s Second Army was made up of 10 infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions. They had thus in combination an overwhelming superiority over Gen. Max von Prittwitz\u2019s Eighth Army, which was defending East Prussia. Coordination between them was, however, completely lacking and led to their defeat in detail. Zhilinsky, who was responsible for combining the action of the two armies, was a man of some administrative capacity but little aptitude for command. Samsonov\u2019s army had to move before its concentration was completed and was deficient in transport. The arrangements for obtaining and recording intelligence were indifferent in spite of the large masses of cavalry available. So defective were the means of communication that the Russians were frequently forced to issue \u201cin clear\u201d (unencrypted) orders by wireless, with the result that the Germans often had complete information of their enemy\u2019s moves and intentions. With the German declaration of war against Russia on August 1, 1914, all hope had been lost of the conflict between Serbia and Austria-Hungary remaining a localized affair. Armies were already mobilizing along what would become the Eastern Front. Rennenkampf crossed the frontier on August 17, driving back a German force at Stallup\u00f6nen (now Nesterov, Russia). After a hard battle at Gumbinnen (August 19\u201320), Rennenkampf defeated Prittwitz, who had concentrated against him the bulk of his army, leaving only one corps to observe the southern frontier. Meanwhile, Samsonov, moving slowly forward by M\u0142awa, crossed into East Prussia on August 21, causing Prittwitz, in momentary panic, to announce his intention of withdrawing behind the Vistula. Prittwitz was promptly replaced by Paul von Hindenburg, with Erich Ludendorff as chief of staff. Within a week Ludendorff had completely defeated the Second Army at the Battle of Tannenberg (August 26\u201330, 1914), surrounding and capturing the greater portion of it. Receiving a reinforcement of two corps which had been hastily recalled from France, Ludendorff then turned on Rennenkampf, who had remained inactive during the disaster at Tannenberg. From September 1 to September 15 Rennenkampf was attacked and driven out of East Prussia with very heavy casualties at the Battle of Masurian Lakes. In these operations the Russians had suffered a total loss of some 250,000 men, crippling in spite of Russia\u2019s immense reserves. Much war mat\u00e9riel had also been lost, and this could not easily be replaced. On the other hand, this invasion of East Prussia, by causing the recall of two corps from the west at the moment of France\u2019s crisis, had made possible the victory at the Marne. Meanwhile, in Galicia, Austria-Hungary had suffered a serious defeat at the hands of Ivanov\u2019s Southwestern army group.

However, their flank guard of the Second and Third armies was unable to withstand the onslaught of the Russian Third and Eighth armies. On September 2 Lemberg was lost, and the advance of the victorious left wing was consequently stayed. Two corps from the Russian Ninth Army (which had been formed at Warsaw as a central reserve) now reinforced Ivanov\u2019s right wing, and the whole Austro-Hungarian line was gradually pressed back. On September 11 a retirement to the San was ordered by the Austro-Hungarian command; by the end of the month they had withdrawn to within 50 miles (80 km) of Krak\u00f3w, leaving their fortress of Przemy\u015bl to withstand an extended siege. The Austro-Hungarian defeat in Galicia compelled the German Supreme Command to send direct assistance to its reeling ally. This was done by the transfer of five and a half corps, formed into the Ninth Army, from East Prussia to the Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa front. From there the Ninth Army marched on Warsaw in the last days of September in conjunction with a simultaneous advance along the whole Austro-Hungarian front up to the Carpathians. The Russians had halted on the San after the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian forces and were in the process of transferring troops north to form a new front south of Warsaw. This regrouping was carried out in safety behind the Vistula, with only cavalry being left to oppose the German advance west of the river. By the middle of October, the German Ninth Army was near Warsaw, but the Austro-Hungarian advance had been held up on the San. The Russians now counterattacked all along the line. In the south they drove the Austro-Hungarian forces back to the Dunajec River, in the centre they compelled the German Ninth Army to fall back, and in the north the newly constituted Russian Tenth Army crossed the frontiers of East Prussia. The intention of Grand Duke Nicholas, the Russian commander in chief, was now to invade Silesia with his Fifth, Fourth, and Ninth armies, in that order from the north. His right flank was to be protected by the Tenth Army in the east of East Prussia and by the First and Second armies north and west of Warsaw, his left flank by the advance of the Third and Eighth armies in Galicia. The Germans had thoroughly broken up the infrastructure in southwest Poland during their retreat, and the Russian advance was slow and halting. Their more nimble opponents once again used the superior mobility given them by their highly developed network of railways to launch a telling counterstrike. A German Eastern Front Command was constituted under Hindenburg and Ludendorff, and the German Ninth Army, now under Gen. August von Mackensen, was withdrawn from southwest Poland and concentrated between Posen and Torun. It advanced on November 11, with its left flank on the Vistula, against the right flank and rear of the Russian main armies. The Russian First and Second armies were severely mauled, and by November 17 the Second Army was in a critical situation, almost completely surrounded at \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. It was saved by a skillful intervention by Russian Gen. Paul von Plehwe\u2019s Fifth Army, and the Germans were now themselves faced with envelopment and disaster. Thanks to Rennenkampf\u2019s failure to act with due haste, however, they extricated themselves from danger. Four corps from the Western Front were released with the conclusion of the First Battle of Ypres, and these now joined Mackensen. This enabled him again to advance and to capture \u0141owicz and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a by December 12.

It ranged from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south, involved most of Eastern Europe, and stretched deep into Central Europe. The term contrasts with the Western Front, which was being fought in Belgium and France. During 1910, Russian General Yuri Danilov developed \"Plan 19\" under which four armies would invade East Prussia. This plan was criticised as Austria-Hungary could be a greater threat than the German Empire. So instead of four armies invading East Prussia, the Russians planned to send two armies to East Prussia, and two armies to defend against Austro-Hungarian forces invading from Galicia. In the opening months of the war, the Imperial Russian Army attempted an invasion of eastern Prussia in the Northwestern theater, only to be beaten back by Germany after some initial success. At the same time, in the south, they successfully invaded Galicia, defeating the Austro-Hungarian forces there. In Russian Poland, the Germans failed to take Warsaw. But by 1915, the German and Austro-Hungarian forces were on the advance, dealing the Russians heavy casualties in Galicia and in Poland, forcing them to retreat. Grand Duke Nicholas was sacked from his position as the commander-in-chief and replaced by Tsar Nicholas himself. Several offensives against the Germans in 1916 failed, including the Lake Naroch Offensive and the Baranovichi Offensive. However, General Aleksei Brusilov oversaw a highly successful operation against Austria-Hungary that became known as the Brusilov offensive, which saw the Russian Army make large gains. Being the largest and most lethal offensive of World War I, the effects of the Brusilov offensive were far reaching. It helped to relieve the German pressure during the Battle of Verdun, while also helping to relieve the Austro-Hungarian pressure on the Italians. As a result, the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces were fatally weakened, and finally Romania decided to enter the war on the side of the Allies. However, the Russian human and material losses also greatly contributed to the Russian Revolutions. Romania entered the war in August 1916. The Allied Powers promised the region of Transylvania (which was part of Austria-Hungary) in return for Romanian support. The Romanian Army invaded Transylvania and had initial successes, but was forced to stop and was pushed back by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians when Bulgaria attacked them from the south. Meanwhile, a revolution occurred in Russia in March 1917 (one of the causes being the hardships of the war). Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate and a Russian Provisional Government was founded, with Georgy Lvov as its first leader, who was eventually replaced by Alexander Kerensky. The newly formed Russian Republic continued to fight the war alongside Romania and the rest of the Entente in desultory fashion. It was overthrown by the Bolsheviks in November 1917. Following the Armistice of Foc\u0219ani between Romania and the Central Powers, Romania also signed a peace treaty with the Central Powers on 7 May 1918, however it was canceled by Romania on 10 November 1918. The new government established by the Bolsheviks signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers in March 1918, taking it out of the war; leading to a Central Powers victory on the Eastern Front and Russian defeat in World War I. The front in the east was much longer than that in the west. The theater of war was roughly delimited by the Baltic Sea in the west and Minsk in the east, and Saint Petersburg in the north and the Black Sea in the south, a distance of more than 1,600 kilometres (990 mi). This had a drastic effect on the nature of the warfare. While the war on the Western Front developed into trench warfare, the battle lines on the Eastern Front were much more fluid and trenches never truly developed. This was because the greater length of the front ensured that the density of soldiers in the line was lower so the line was easier to break. Once broken, the sparse communication networks made it difficult for the defender to rush reinforcements to the rupture in the line, mounting rapid counteroffensives to seal off any breakthrough. Propaganda was a key component of the culture of World War I. It was often shown through state-controlled media, and helped to bolster nationalism and patriotism within countries. On the Eastern Front, propaganda took many forms such as opera, film, spy fiction, theater\n\nquestion: What was the Eastern Front in World War I?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Eastern Front or Eastern Theater of World War I was a theater of operations that encompassed the entire frontier between Russia and Romania on one side and Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire, and Germany on the other.", "usage": 1154}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Across the Eastern Front the amount of propaganda used in each country varied from state to state. Propaganda took many forms within each country and was distributed by many different groups. Most commonly the state produced propaganda, but other groups, such as anti-war organizations, also generated propaganda. Prior to the outbreak of war, German strategy was based almost entirely on the so-called Schlieffen Plan. With the Franco-Russian Agreement in place, Germany knew that war with either of these combatants would result in war with the other, which meant that there would be war in both the west and the east (two-front war). Therefore, the German General Staff, under Alfred von Schlieffen and then Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, planned a quick, all-out ground war on the Western Front to take France and, upon victory, Germany would turn its attention to Russia in the east. Schlieffen believed Russia would not be ready or willing to move against and attack Germany due to the huge losses of military equipment that Russia had suffered in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905, its low population density and lack of railroads. Conversely, the Imperial German Navy believed it could be victorious over Britain with Russian neutrality, something which Moltke knew would not be possible. In the immediate years preceding the First World War, the Kingdom of Romania was involved in the Second Balkan War on the side of Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and the Ottoman Empire against Bulgaria. The Treaty of Bucharest, signed on 10 August 1913, ended the Balkan conflict and added 6,960 square kilometers to Romania's territory. Although militarized, Romania decided upon a policy of neutrality at the start of the First World War, mainly due to having territorial interests in both Austria-Hungary (Transylvania and Bukovina) and in Russia (Bessarabia). Strong cultural influences also affected Romanian leanings, however. King Carol I, as a Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, favoured his Germanic roots, while the Romanian people, influenced by their Orthodox church and Latin-based language, were inclined to join France. Perhaps King Carol's attempts at joining the war on the side of the Central powers would have been fruitful had he not died in 1914, but Romanian disenchantment with Austria-Hungary had already influenced public and political opinion. French endorsement of Romanian action against Bulgaria, and support of the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest was particularly effective at inclining Romania towards the Entente. Furthermore, Russian courting of Romanian sympathies, exemplified by the visit of the Tsar to Constan\u021ba on 14 June 1914, signaled in a new era of positive relations between the two countries. Nevertheless, King Ferdinand I of Romania maintained a policy of neutrality, intending to gain the most for Romania by negotiating between competing powers. The result of the negotiations with the Entente was the Treaty of Bucharest (1916), which stipulated the conditions under which Romania agreed to join the war on the side of the Entente, particularly territorial promises in Austria-Hungary: Transylvania, Cri\u0219ana and Maramure\u0219, the whole Banat and most of Bukovina. According to historian John Keegan, these enticements offered by the Allies were never concrete, for in secret, Russia and France agreed not to honor any conventions when the end of the war came. The immediate reason for Russia's involvement in the First World War was a direct result of the decisions made by the statesmen and generals during July 1914. The July Crisis was the culmination of a series of diplomatic conflicts that took place in the decades prior to 1914, and this is fundamental to an understanding of Russia's position immediately prior to the War. According to D. C. Lieven, Russia was formidable and was able to back up her diplomatic policies with force. One of the most significant factors in bringing Russia to the brink of war was the downfall of her economy. The 20 percent jump in defense expenditure during 1866\u201377 forced them to change their position within Europe and shift the balance of power out of her favour. At the time, Russian infrastructure was backward and the Russian government had to invest far more than its European rivals in structural changes. In addition there were overwhelming burdens of defense, which would ultimately result in an economic downfall for the Russians. This was a major strain on the Russian population, but also served as a direct threat to military expenditure. Thus the only way the Russians could sustain the strains of European war would be to place more emphasis on foreign investment from the French who essentially came to Russia's aid for industrial change. The Franco-Russian Alliance allowed for the Russian defense to grow and aid the European balance of power during the growth of the German Empire's might. Nevertheless, one of the key factors was that of the Russian foreign policy between 1890 and 1914. The Russian army was large, but had poor leadership and poor equipment, and increasingly poor morale until by\n\nquestion: What was the Eastern Front in World War I?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Eastern Front was an all-out ground war on the Western Front to take France and, upon victory, Germany would turn its attention to Russia in the east.", "usage": 1144}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In order for the Russians to legitimize their war efforts, the government constructed an image of the enemy through state-instituted propaganda. Their main aim was to help overcome the legend of the \"invincible\" German war machine, in order to boost the morale of civilians and soldiers. Russian propaganda often took the form of showing the Germans as a civilized nation, with barbaric \"inhuman\" traits. Russian propaganda also exploited the image of the Russian POWs who were in the German camps, again in order to boost the morale of their troops, serving as encouragement to defeat the enemy and to get their fellow soldiers out of German POW camps that were perceived as inhumane. An element of the Russian propaganda was the Investigate Commission formed in April 1915. It was led by Aleksei Krivtsov, and the study was tasked with the job of studying the legal violations committed by of the Central Powers and then getting this information to the Russian public. This commission published photographs of letters that were allegedly found on fallen German soldiers. These letters document the German correspondents saying to \"take no prisoners.\" A museum was also set up in Petrograd, which displayed pictures that showed how \"inhumanly\" the Germans were treating prisoners of war. Also, the Russians chose to discard the name Saint Petersburg to remove the German-sounding \"Saint\" and \"-burg\", favouring the more Russian-sounding Petrograd. Austria-Hungary's participation in the outbreak of World War I has been neglected by historians, as emphasis has traditionally been placed on Germany's role as the prime instigator. However, the \"spark\" that ignited the First World War is attributed to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, which took place on 28 June 1914. Approximately a month later, on 28 July 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This act led to a series of events that would quickly expand into the First World War; thus, the Habsburg government in Vienna initiated the pivotal decision that would begin the conflict. The causes of the Great War have generally been defined in diplomatic terms, but certain deep-seated issues in Austria-Hungary undoubtedly contributed to the beginnings of the First World War. The Austro-Hungarian situation in the Balkans pre-1914 is a primary factor in its involvement in the war. The movement towards South Slav unity was a major problem for the Habsburg Empire, which was facing increasing nationalist pressure from its multinational populace. As Europe's third largest state, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was hardly homogeneous; comprising over fifty million people and eleven nationalities, the Empire was a conglomeration of a number of diverse cultures, languages, and peoples. Specifically, the South Slavic people of Austria-Hungary desired to amalgamate with Serbia in an effort to officially solidify their shared cultural heritage. Over seven million South Slavs lived inside the Empire, while three million lived outside it. With the growing emergence of nationalism in the twentieth century, unity of all South Slavs looked promising. This tension is exemplified by Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf's letter to Franz Ferdinand: The unification of the South Slav race is one of the powerful national movements which can neither be ignored nor kept down. The question can only be, whether unification will take place within the boundaries of the Monarchy \u2013 that is at the expense of Serbia's independence \u2013 or under Serbia's leadership at the expense of the Monarchy. The cost to the Monarchy would be the loss of its South Slav provinces and thus of almost its entire coastline. The loss of territory and prestige would relegate the Monarchy to the status of a small power. The annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908 by Austrian foreign minister Baron von Aehrenthal in an effort to assert domination over the Balkans inflamed Slavic nationalism and angered Serbia. Bosnia-Herzegovina became a \"rallying cry\" for South Slavs, with hostilities between Austria-Hungary and Serbia steadily increasing. The situation was ripe for conflict, and when the Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Austrian imperial heir, Franz Ferdinand, these longstanding hostilities culminated into an all-out war. The Allied Powers wholeheartedly supported the Slavs' nationalistic fight. George Macaulay Trevelyan, a British historian, saw Serbia's war against Austria-Hungary as a \"war of liberation\" that would \"free South Slavs from tyranny.\" In his own words: \"If ever there was a battle for freedom, there is such a battle now going on in Southeastern Europe against Austrian and Magyar. If this war ends in the overthrow of the Magyar tyranny, an immense step forward will have been taken toward racial liberty and European peace.\" Prior to 1915, the Russians' lack of success in war and diplomacy in the six decades before 1914 sapped the country's moral strength. The triumphs of Britain and Germany in the martial, diplomatic and economic spheres put these\n\nquestion: What was the Eastern Front in World War I?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1127}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This was a source of national pride, self-confidence and unity. It helped reconcile the worker to the state and the Bavarian or Scotsman to rule from Berlin or London. In the years prior to 1914, Austro-Russian co-operation was both crucial for European peace and difficult to maintain. Old suspicions exacerbated by the Bosnian crisis stood in the way of agreement between the two empires, as did ethnic sensitivities. Russia's historical role as liberator of the Balkans was difficult to square with Austria's determination to control adjacent territories.  In 1913\u20131914 Saint Petersburg was too concerned with its own weakness and what it saw as threats to vital Russian interests, to spare much thought for Vienna's feelings. The Russians were, with some justice, indignant that the concessions they had made after the First Balkan War in the interest of European peace had not been reciprocated by the Central Powers. This was doubly dangerous given the growing evidence flowing into Petersburg about Germany's aggressive intentions. Both Bazarov and the agents of the Russian secret political police in Germany reported the concern aroused in public opinion by the press war against Russia, which raged in the spring of 1914. The Russian military was the largest in the world consisting of 1.4 million men on duty just prior to the war. They could also mobilize up to 5 million men, but only had 4.6 million rifles to give them. It also had poor leadership. The war in the east began with the Russian invasion of East Prussia on 17 August 1914 and the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia. The Russian offensive in the Battle of Stallup\u00f6nen, which was the opening battle of the Eastern Front, quickly turned to a disastrous defeat following the Battle of Tannenberg in August 1914; even though the Russians were successfully defending at Gumbinnen a while before Tannenberg. After the Russian disaster, German troops under the command of Hindenburg inflicted another crushing defeat on the numerically superior Russian army in the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes. A second Russian incursion into Galicia was more successful, with the Russians controlling almost all of that region by the end of 1914, routing four Austrian armies in the process. Under the command of Nikolai Ivanov, Nikolai Ruzsky and Aleksei Brusilov, the Russians won the Battle of Galicia in September and began the Siege of Przemy\u015bl, the next fortress on the road towards Krak\u00f3w. This early Russian success in 1914 on the Austro-Russian border was a reason for concern to the Central Powers and caused considerable German forces to be transferred to the East to take pressure off the Austrians, leading to the creation of the new German Ninth Army. The Austro-Hungarian government accepted the Polish proposal of establishing the Supreme National Committee as the Polish central authority within the Empire, responsible for the formation of the Polish Legions, an auxiliary military formation within the Austro-Hungarian army. At the end of 1914, the main focus of the fighting shifted to central part of Russian Poland, west of the river Vistula. The October Battle of the Vistula River and the November Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a brought little advancement for the Germans, but at least kept the Russians at a safe distance. The Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies continued to clash along the Carpathian Front throughout the winter of 1914\u20131915. Przemysl fortress managed to hold out deep behind enemy lines throughout this period, with the Russians bypassing it in order to attack the Austro-Hungarian troops further to the west. They made some progress, crossing the Carpathian Mountains in February and March 1915, but then the German relief helped the Austrians stop further Russian advances. In the meantime, Przemysl was almost entirely destroyed and the Siege of Przemysl ended in a defeat for the Austrians. In 1915 the Chief of German Great General Staff, General of Infantry Erich von Falkenhayn decided to make its main effort on the Eastern Front, and accordingly transferred considerable forces there. The year began with a successful German offensive in the area of the Masurian lakes. At the same time, a large battle for the city of Przasnysz took place on the Polish front. The city changed hands several times but eventually remained in Russian hands. As a result of the battle, the Germans lost 38 000 soldiers and Russian losses amounted to about 70 000 men. In May 1915, to eliminate the Russian threat the Central Powers began the successful Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive in Galicia. After the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, the German and Austro-Hungarian troops on the Eastern Front functioned under a unified command. The offensive soon turned into a general advance and a corresponding strategic retreat by the Russian Army.

Only by 1916 did the buildup of Russian war industries increase the production of war material and improve the supply situation. By mid-1915, the Russians had been expelled from Russian Poland and hence pushed hundreds of kilometers away from the borders of the Central Powers, removing the threat of Russian invasion of Germany, although there was still slight Russian penetration into Austria-Hungary. At the end of 1915 the German-Austrian advance was stopped on the line Riga\u2013Jakobstadt\u2013D\u00fcnaburg\u2013Baranovichi\u2013Pinsk\u2013Dubno\u2013Tarnopol. The general outline of this front line did not change until the Russian collapse in 1917. During the campaign of 1915, the Russian Empire lost the entire line of western fortresses, and more than 4,000 guns. The causes of heavy defeats and losses of personnel, weapons, and as a result - vast territories (the entire Kingdom of Poland, part of the Baltic states, Grodno, partly Volhynia and Podolia provinces - up to 300,000 square kilometers) were to a large extent systemic shortcomings in the management of the armed forces and the defense industry. The multi-stage placement of military orders, their slow passage in the depths of the War Ministry, the disunity of the front and rear played a negative role. Thus, until the autumn of 1915, the Russian Supreme Commander-in-Chief only coordinated the actions of the commanders-in-chief of the armies of the fronts, distributed reinforcements, requesting them from the War Ministry. The Minister of War was responsible for organizing the production of weapons and ammunition, the implementation of the replenishment of troop personnel, military transportation outside the provinces declared a theater of military operations. The military districts in the theater of operations were subordinate to the commanders-in-chief of the armies of the fronts, but not to the Headquarters. Military production also lagged behind: until the end of autumn, the active army suffered from a shortage of rifles and ammunition, the consumption of which turned out to be incommensurable with the volume of production. Contemporaries also noted the isolation of the Russian commanding staff from the soldiers, the lack of practical warfare skills among the top-level commanders. \"We did have courage to send people to mass slaughter, hiding behind the difficulty of tactical responsibility, to slaughter often without purpose. We sent them, being ourselves far away, not seeing either our own or the enemy, and therefore not conforming to reality. Instead of punishment, we reward such leaders, because as far as the leaders were far away, the same, but still more, the higher leaders kept even more distant. People ceased to be people, but turned into pawns. We went to the fight in a state of some kind of oblivion and stunnedness\", wrote the representative of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Infantry General Fyodor Palitzin, in his diary. Failures in the Russian system of command and control of troops and the organization of hostilities occurred at other levels. Thus, serious shortcomings in reconnaissance led to the absence of any analysis of the enemy's plans and actions. With a general superiority in forces, almost every Central Powers's operation in 1915 was \"unexpected\" for the command from the front to the regimental level. Passion for undercover intelligence in the highest headquarters did not justify itself, and tactical intelligence was still based on barely reliable testimony of prisoners, in the absence of which the command up to the army, inclusive, was simply \"blind\". The separation of artillery from infantry with subordination to the inspectors of the corps and ammunition supply units (park brigades and divisions) created difficulties in the operational replenishment of ammunition and shells in the combat units. At the same time, huge stockpiles of ammunition were created in the fortresses, which were then delivered to the enemy during the retreat or destroyed due to the impossibility of evacuation. Special units were not created for the construction of fortifications in the rear of the troops. Most often, such work was hastily carried out by militia squads and the mobilized local population, sometimes including women, and then brought to the necessary defensive state by the combat units retreating on them, already exhausted by battles and night marches. The country\u2019s geographic expanses and a large population again became the salvation of the Russia from complete military defeat, however, by the end of the 1915 campaign, it became obvious that without a radical restructuring of the war strategy, methods of managing military potential, victory becomes unattainable, and new defeats can cause another collapse of transport (as in the case of mass exodus and the hasty \"evacuation\" of the western provinces), supplies, public administration and, as a result, the aggravation of the struggle for power in the country. Nevertheless, as before, for the military leadership of the Russian Empire, there was only one way to victory - the\n\nquestion: What was the Eastern Front in World War I?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1117}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

To some extent, the Russian side in the autumn played along with E. von Falkenhayn, who, not considering the Russian direction to have at least some strategic prospect for achieving victory in the war, made it impossible to develop the offensive of the Eastern Front. After the Battle of Sarikamish, the Russo-Turkish front quickly turned in favor of Russian forces. The Turks were concerned with reorganizing their army and also fighting the massive Allied armada that landed in Galipoli. Meanwhile, Russia was preoccupied with other armies on the Eastern Front. However, the appointment of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich as Viceroy and Commander in the Caucasus in September 1915 revived the situation of the Russo-Turkish front. When the Allies withdrew from Gallipoli in December, the Caucasus Army's Chief of Staff General Nikolai Yudenich believed Turkish forces would take action against his army. This concern was legitimate: Bulgaria's entry into the war as Germany's ally in October caused serious alarm, as a land route from Germany to Turkey was now open and would allow for an unrestricted flow of German weapons to the Turks. A \"window of opportunity\" appeared that would allow the Russians to destroy the Turkish Third Army, as the British required assistance in Mesopotamia (now modern day Iraq). Britain's efforts to besiege Baghdad had been halted at Ctesiphon, and they were forced to retreat. This led to an increasing number of attacks by Turkish forces. The British requested the Russians to attack in an attempt to distract the Turks, and Yudenich agreed. The resulting offensive began on 10 January 1916. This offensive was unanticipated by the Turks, as it was in the middle of winter. The Turkish situation was exacerbated by the absences of Third Army's commander Kamil Pasha and Chief of Staff Major Guse. Coupled with an imbalance of forces \u2013 the Russians had 325,000 troops while the Turks only 78,000 \u2013 the situation appeared grim for the Central Powers. After three months of fighting, the Russians captured the city of Trabzon on 18 April 1916. Allied operations in 1916 were dictated by an urgent need to force Germany to transfer forces from its Western to Eastern fronts, to relieve the pressure on the French at the Battle of Verdun. This was to be accomplished by a series of Russian offensives which would force the Germans to deploy additional forces to counter them. The first such operation was the Lake Naroch Offensive in March\u2013April 1916, which ended in failure. The Italian operations during 1916 had one extraordinary result: Austrian divisions were pulled away from the Russian southern front. This allowed the Russian forces to organize a counter-offensive. The Brusilov offensive was a large tactical assault carried out by Russian forces against Austro-Hungarian forces in Galicia. General Aleksei Brusilov believed victory against the Central Powers was possible if close attention was paid to preparation. Brusilov suggested that the Russians should attack on a wide front, and to position their trenches a mere 75 yards (69 m) away from Austrian trenches. Brusilov's plan worked impeccably. The Russians outnumbered the Austrians 200,000 to 150,000, and held a considerable advantage in guns, with 904 large guns to 600. Most importantly innovative new tactics similar to those independently invented by Erwin Rommel were used to perform quick and effective close-range surprise attacks that allowed a steady advance. The Russian Eighth Army overwhelmed the Austrian Fourth and pushed on to Lutsk, advancing 40 miles (64 km) beyond the starting position. Over a million Austrians were lost, with over 500,000 men killed or taken prisoner by mid-June. Although the Brusilov offensive was initially successful, it slowed down considerably. An inadequate number of troops and poorly maintained supply lines hindered Brusilov's ability to follow up on the initial victories in June. The Brusilov offensive is considered to be the greatest Russian victory of the First World War.: 52 Although it cost the Russians half a million casualties only during the first two months offensive, the offensive successfully diverted substantial forces of the Central Powers from the Western front, and persuaded Romania to join the war, diverting even more Central Powers forces to the East. The development of the Russian armament industry was mainly supported by French investors before the war. The Russian High Command saw the reason for the losses of the war in the lack of munitions. Most of these supplies were lost when advancing German troops occupied the fortifications. The production of munitions in the Tsarist empire was difficult, confidence in private enterprise among army personnel was low, and little capital was invested in the industry until 1916. About fifty percent of Russian ammunition requirements were supplied by Britain and the USA. As the Western companies were also responsible for supplying the needs of the Western Front, only a small proportion of the required quantity could be transported to Russia. In the following year, the Russian armaments industry was able to increase its production figures by a factor of two and a half and, despite the insufficient help of the Allies\n\nquestion: What was the Eastern Front in World War I?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Eastern Front was a front in World War I characterized with a series of Russian offensives against the Central Powers in Eastern Europe.", "usage": 1177}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It is no exaggeration to say that Roumania may be the turning-point of the campaign. If the Germans fail there it will be the greatest disaster inflicted upon them. Afterwards it will only be a question of time. But should Germany succeed I hesitate to think what the effect will be on the fortunes of the campaign. \u2026 and yet no one seems to have thought it his particular duty to prepare a plan... Up until 1916, the Romanians followed the tides of war with interest, while attempting to situate themselves in the most advantageous position. French and Russian diplomats had begun courting the Romanians early on, but persuasion tactics gradually intensified. For King Ferdinand to commit his force of half a million men, he expected the Allies to offer a substantial incentive. Playing on Romanian anti-Hungarian sentiment the Allies promised the Austria-Hungarian territory of Ardeal (Transylvania) to Romania. Transylvanian demographics strongly favoured the Romanians. Romania succumbed to Allied enticement on 18 August 1916. Nine days later, on 27 August, Romanian troops marched into Transylvania. Romania's entry into the war provoked major strategic changes for the Germans. In September 1916, German troops were mobilized to the Eastern Front. Additionally, the German Chief of the General Staff, General Erich Von Falkenhayn was forced to resign from office though his successor appointed him to command the combined Central Powers forces against Romania, along with General August von Mackensen. Kaiser Wilhelm II immediately replaced Falkenhayn with Paul von Hindenburg. Von Hindenburg's deputy, the more adept Erich Ludendorff, was given effective control of the army and ordered to advance on Romania. On 3 September, the first troops of the Central Powers marched into Romanian territory. Simultaneously, the Bulgarian Air Force commenced an incessant bombing of Bucharest. In an attempt to relieve some pressure, French and British forces launched a new offensive known as the Battle of the Somme, while the Brusilov offensive continued in the East. It is certain that so relatively small a state as Rumania had never before been given a role so important, and, indeed, so decisive for the history of the world at so favorable a moment. Never before had two Great Powers like Germany and Austria found themselves so much at the mercy of the military resources of a country which had scarcely one twentieth of the population of the two great states. Judging by the military situation, it was to be expected that Rumania had only to advance where she wished to decide the world war in favor of those Powers which had been hurling themselves at us in vain for years. Thus everything seemed to depend on whether Rumania was ready to make any sort of use of her momentary advantage. The entrance of Romania into the war was disconcerting for von Hindenburg. On 15 September, Paul von Hindenburg issued the following order, stating that: \"The main task of the Armies is now to hold fast all positions on the Western, Eastern, Italian and Macedonian Fronts, and to employ all other available forces against Rumania.\" Fortunately for the Central Powers, the quantity and quality of the Romanian Army was overestimated. Although numbering half a million men, the Romanian Army suffered from poor training and a lack of appropriate equipment. The initial success of the Romanian Army in Austria-Hungarian territory was quickly undermined by the Central Powers. German and Austro-Hungarian troops advanced from the north, while Bulgarian-Turkish-German forces marched into Romania from the south. Although thought to be a tactical blunder by contemporaries, the Romanians opted to mount operations in both directions. By the middle of November the German force passed through the Carpathians, suffering significant casualties due to determined Romanian resistance. By 5 December, Bulgarian troops had crossed the Danube and were approaching the capital, Bucharest. At the same time as the Austro-Hungarian troops moved east, and as the Bulgarians marched north, the Turks had sent in two army divisions by sea to the Dobruja from the east. Eventually, the Romanian forces were pushed back behind the Siret in northern Moldavia. They received help from the Allies, notably from France which sent a military mission of more than a thousand officers, health and support staff. The Act of 5 November 1916 was proclaimed then to the Poles jointly by the Emperors Wilhelm II of Germany and Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary. This act promised the creation of the Kingdom of Poland out of territory of Congress Poland, envisioned by its authors as a puppet state controlled by the Central Powers. The origin of that document was the dire need to draft new recruits from German-occupied Poland for the war with Russia. Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918 ending the World War I, in spite of the previous initial total dependence of the kingdom on its sponsors, it ultimately served against their intentions as the cornerstone proto state of the nascent Second Polish Republic, the latter conposed also of territories never intended by the Central Powers to be c\n\nquestion: What was the Eastern Front in World War I?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1133}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

By January 1917, the ranks of the Romanian army had been significantly thinned. Roughly 150,000 Romanian soldiers had been taken prisoner, 200,000 men were dead or wounded, and lost two thirds of their country, including the capital. Importantly, the Ploie\u0219ti oilfields, the only significant source of oil in Europe west of the Black Sea, had been destroyed before they were abandoned to the Central Powers. The Russian February Revolution aimed to topple the Russian monarchy and resulted in the creation of the Provisional Government. The revolution was a turning point in Russian history, and its significance and influence can still be felt in many countries today. Although many Russians wanted a revolution, no one had expected it to happen when it did \u2013 let alone how it did. On International Women's Day, Thursday, 23 February 1917/8 March 1917, as many as 90,000 female workers in the city of Petrograd left their factory jobs and marched through the streets, shouting \"Bread\", \"Down with the autocracy!\" and \"Stop the War!\" These women were tired, hungry, and angry, after working long hours in miserable conditions to feed their families because their menfolk were fighting at the front. They were not alone in demanding change; more than 150,000 men and women took to the streets to protest the next day. By Saturday, 25 February, the city of Petrograd was essentially shut down. No one was allowed to work or wanted to work. Even though there were a few incidents of police and soldiers firing into the crowds, those groups soon mutinied and joined the protesters. Tsar Nicholas II, who was not in Petrograd during the revolution, heard reports of the protests but chose not to take them seriously. By 1 March, it was obvious to everyone except the Tsar himself, that his rule was over. On 2 March it was made official. From this point onwards Russia was administered by the Russian Provisional Government until the October Revolution. In early July 1917, on a relatively small area of the Romanian front, there began one of the largest concentrations of combat forces and means known during the conflagration: nine armies, 80 infantry divisions with 974 battalions, 19 cavalry divisions with 550 squadrons and 923 artillery batteries; in total they numbered some 800,000 men, with about one million in their immediate reserve. Between late July and early September, the Romanian Army fought the battles of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti, M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti and Oituz, managing to stop the German-Austro-Hungarian advance, inflicting heavy losses in the process and winning the most important Allied victories on the Eastern Front in 1917. As a result of these operations, the remaining Romanian territories remained unoccupied, tying down nearly 1,000,000 Central Powers troops and prompting The Times to describe the Romanian front as \"The only point of light in the East\". On 29 June 1917, Alexander Kerensky, the Minister of War in the Russian Provisional Government, launched the Kerensky offensive to end Austria-Hungary once and for all. The Russians made only 6 miles (9.7 km) of progress but the Austrians counterattacked and drove them almost entirely out of Austria-Hungary, and they retreated 150 miles (240 km), losing Tarnopol, Stanislau and Czernowitz. This defeat was accompanied by 60,000 casualties and contributed greatly to the collapse of the Russian Army during the October Revolution. Although the February Revolution had overthrown the Tsar, the Bolsheviks still were not satisfied. In their view, the new Provisional Government was merely a more deceptive continuation of the previous government; they still refused to withdraw from the war despite how badly it was going. The upper class still wielded considerable influence in Russian economics and politics, so by September 1917, Lenin began advocating for a second revolution - one that would allow the workers and peasants to gain total control over the country.  The Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party convened on 10 October, and after much heated debate, agreed that it was time to begin planning for an armed insurrection. Troops who were loyal to the Bolsheviks took control of the telegraph stations, power stations, strategic bridges, post offices, train stations, and state banks. Petrograd was officially in the hands of the Bolsheviks, who greatly increased their organization in factory groups and in many barracks throughout Petrograd. They concentrated on devising a plan for overturning the Provisional Government, with a coup d'\u00e9tat. On 24 October, Lenin emerged from hiding in a suburb, entered the city, set up his headquarters at the Smolny Institute and worked to complete his three-phase plan. With the main bridges and the main railways secured, only the Winter Palace, and with it the Provisional Government, remained to be taken. On the evening of 7 November, the troops that were loyal to the Bolsheviks infiltrated the Winter Palace.

Lenin announced that the new Bolshevik government would immediately be seeking an end to the war, implementing a system of worker\u2019s democracy, and establishing collective ownership of all farms and factories. Lenin's new Bolshevik government tried to end the war, with a ceasefire being declared on 15 December 1917 along lines agreed in November. At the same time, the Bolsheviks launched a full-scale military offensive against its opponents: Ukraine and separatist governments in the Don region. During the peace negotiations between the Soviets and the Central Powers, the Germans demanded enormous concessions, eventually resulting in the failure of the long-drawn-out peace negotiations on 17 February 1918. At the same time, the Central Powers concluded a military treaty with Ukraine which was losing ground in the fight with invading Bolshevik forces.  The Russian Civil War, which started just after November 1917, would tear apart Russia for three years. As a result of the events in 1917, many groups opposed to Lenin's Bolsheviks had formed. With the fall of Nicholas II, many parts of the Russian Empire took the opportunity to declare their independence, one of which was Finland, which did so in December 1917; however, Finland too collapsed into a civil war. Finland declared itself independent on 6 December 1917, and this was accepted by Lenin a month later. The Finnish Parliament elected a German prince as King of Finland. However, the Socialists (The Reds) and the Whites in Finland fell into war with each other in January 1918. The Reds wanted Finland to be a Soviet republic and were aided by Russian forces still in Finland. The Whites of Finland were led by General C.G.E.Mannerheim, a Finnish baron who had been in the Tsar's service since he was 15 years old. The Whites were also offered help by a German Expeditionary Corps led by German General Goltz. Though Mannerheim never accepted the offer, the German corps landed in Finland in April 1918. After the disintegration of the Russian imperial army and navy in 1917, the Council of People's Commissars headed by Leon Trotsky set about creating a new army. By a decree on 28 January 1918, the council created the Workers' and Peoples' Red Army; it began recruitment on a voluntary basis, but on 22 April, the Soviet government made serving in the army compulsory for anyone who did not employ hired labor. Several officers who had served in the Russian Imperial Army defected to the Red Army in support of the Bolshevik cause. Many of them were of an aristocratic background but became disillusioned with imperialism and monarchism, although the Red Army still mostly consisted of ordinary workers and peasants.  With the German Army just 85 miles (137 km) from the Russian capital Petrograd (St. Petersburg) on 3 March 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed and the Eastern Front ceased to be a war zone. While the treaty was practically obsolete before the end of the year, it did provide some relief to the Bolsheviks, who were embroiled in a civil war, and affirmed the independence of Ukraine. However, Estonia and Latvia were intended to become a United Baltic Duchy to be ruled by German princes and German nobility as fiefdoms under the German Kaiser. A rump Polish state was also foreseen on the formerly Russian territories. Finland's sovereignty had already been declared in December 1917, and accepted by most nations, including France and Russia, but not by the United Kingdom and the United States. On 7 May 1918 Romania signed the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central Powers, which recognised Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia in return for ceding control of passes in the Carpathian Mountains to Austria-Hungary and granting oil concessions to Germany. Although approved by Parliament, Ferdinand I refused to sign the treaty, hoping for an Allied victory; Romania re-entered the war on 10 November 1918 on the side of the Allies and the Treaty of Bucharest was formally annulled by the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Between 1914 and 1918, an estimated 400,000 to 600,000 ethnic Romanians served with the Austro-Hungarian army, of whom up to 150,000 were killed in action; total military and civilian deaths within contemporary Romanian borders are estimated at 748,000. The Germans were able to repair the oil fields around Ploie\u0219ti and by the end of the war had pumped a million tons of oil. They also requisitioned two million tons of grain from Romanian farmers. These materials were vital in keeping Germany in the war to the end of 1918. With the end of major combat on the Eastern Front, the Germans were able to transfer substantial forces to the west in order to mount an offensive in France in the spring of 1918. This offensive on the Western Front failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough, and the arrival of more and more American units in Europe was sufficient to offset the German advantage. Even after the Russian collapse, about a million German soldiers remained tied up in the east until\n\nquestion: What was the Eastern Front in World War I?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Eastern Front in World War I was a front during World War I.", "usage": 1166}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the end, the Central Powers had to relinquish all of their captured lands on the eastern front, with Germany even being forced to cede territory they held before the war, under various treaties (such as the Treaty of Versailles) signed after the armistice in 1918. Although the Allied Powers' victory led to the Central Powers being forced to cancel the treaty signed with Russia, the victors were at the time intervening in the Russian Civil War, causing bad relations between Russia and the Allied Powers. In comparison to the attention directed to the role played by women on the Western Front during the First World War, the role of women in the east has garnered limited scholarly focus. It is estimated that 20 percent of the Russian industrial working class was conscripted into the army; therefore, women's share of industrial jobs increased dramatically. There were percentage increases in every industry, but the most noticeable increase happened in industrial labour, which increased from 31.4 percent in 1913 to 45 percent in 1918. Women also fought on the Eastern Front. In the later stages of Russia's participation in the war, Russia began forming all-woman combat units, the Women's Battalions, in part to fight plummeting morale among male soldiers by demonstrating Russian women's willingness to fight. In Romania, Ecaterina Teodoroiu actively fought in the Romanian Army and is remembered today as a national hero. British nursing efforts were not limited to the Western Front. Nicknamed the \"Gray partridges\" in reference to their dark gray overcoats, Scottish volunteer nurses arrived in Romania in 1916 under the leadership of Elsie Inglis. In addition to nursing injured personnel, Scottish nurses manned transport vehicles and acted as regimental cooks. The \"Gray Partridges\" were well respected by Romanian, Serbian and Russian troops and as a result, the Romanian press went as far as to characterize them as \"healthy, masculine, and tanned women.\" As a testament to her abilities, Elsie Inglis and her volunteers were entrusted to turn an abandoned building in the city of Gala\u021bi into an operational hospital, which they did in a little more than a day. Yvonne Fitzroy's published journal, \"With the Scottish Nurses in Roumania,\" provides an excellent first hand account of Scottish nursing activities in the Eastern Front. During World War I, approximately 200,000 German soldiers and 2.5 million soldiers from the Austro-Hungarian army entered Russian captivity. During the 1914 Russian campaign the Russians began taking thousands of Austrian prisoners. As a result, the Russian authorities made emergency facilities in Kiev, Penza, Kazan, and later Turkestan to hold the Austrian prisoners of war. As the war continued Russia began to detain soldiers from Germany as well as a growing number from the Austro-Hungarian army. The Tsarist state saw the large population of POWs as a workforce that could benefit the war economy in Russia. Many POWs were employed as farm laborers and miners in Donbas and Krivoi Rog. However, the majority of POWs were employed as laborers constructing canals and building railroads. The living and working environments for these POWs was bleak. There was a shortage of food, clean drinking water and proper medical care. During the summer months malaria was a major problem, and the malnutrition among the POWs led to many cases of scurvy. While working on the Murmansk rail building project over 25,000 POWs died. Information about the bleak conditions of the labor camps reached the German and Austro-Hungarian governments. They began to complain about the treatment of POWs. The Tsarist authorities initially refused to acknowledge the German and Habsburg governments. They rejected their claims because Russian POWs were working on railway construction in Serbia. However, they slowly agreed to stop using prison labor. Life in the camps was extremely rough for the men who resided in them. The Tsarist government could not provide adequate supplies for the men living in their POW camps. The Russian government's inability to supply the POWs in their camps with supplies was due to inadequate resources and bureaucratic rivalries. However, the conditions in the POW camps varied; some were more bearable than others. Disease played a critical role in the loss of life on the Eastern Front. In the East, disease accounted for approximately four times the number of deaths caused by direct combat, in contrast to the three to one ratio in the West. Malaria, cholera, and dysentery contributed to the epidemiological crisis on the Eastern Front; however, typhus fever, transmitted by pathogenic lice and previously unknown to German medical officers before the outbreak of the war, was the most deadly. There was a direct correlation between the environmental conditions of the East and the prevalence of disease. With cities excessively crowded by refugees fleeing their native countries, unsanitary medical conditions created a suitable environment for diseases to spread. Primitive hygienic conditions\n\nquestion: What was the Eastern Front in World War I?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "area of military operations in eastern Europe during World War I between 1914 and 1918", "usage": 1141}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Ultimately, a large scale sanitation program was put into effect. This program, named Sanitit\u00e4tswesen (Medical Affairs), was responsible for ensuring proper hygienic procedures were being carried out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Quarantine centers were built, and diseased neighbourhoods were isolated from the rest of the population. Delousing stations were prevalent in the countryside and in cities to prevent the spread of typhus fever, with mass numbers of natives being forced to take part in this process at military bathhouses. A \"sanitary police\" was also introduced to confirm the cleanliness of homes, and any home deemed unfit would be boarded up with a warning sign. Dogs and cats were also killed for fear of possible infection. To avoid the spread of disease, prostitution became regulated. Prostitutes were required to register for a permit, and authorities demanded mandatory medical examinations for all prostitutes, estimating that seventy percent of prostitutes carried a venereal disease. Military brothels were introduced to combat disease; the city of Kowno emphasized proper educational use of contraceptives such as condoms, encouraged proper cleansing of the genital area after intercourse, and gave instructions on treatment in the case of infection. The Russian casualties in the First World War are difficult to estimate, due to the poor quality of available statistics. Cornish gives a total of 2,006,000 military dead (700,000 killed in action, 970,000 died of wounds, 155,000 died of disease and 181,000 died while POWs). This measure of Russian losses is similar to that of the British Empire, 5% of the male population in the 15 to 49 age group. He says civilian casualties were five to six hundred thousand in the first two years, and were then not kept, so a total of over 1,500,000 is not unlikely. He has over five million men passing into captivity, the majority during 1915. When Russia withdrew from the war, 2,500,000 Russian POWs were in German and Austrian hands. This by far exceeded the total number of prisoners of war (1,880,000) lost by the armies of Britain, France and Germany combined. Only the Austro-Hungarian Army, with 2,200,000 POWs, came even close. The empire of Austria lost approximately 60% of its territory as a result of the war, and evolved into a smaller state with a small homogeneous population of 6.5 million people. With the loss, Vienna was now an imperial capital without an empire to support it. The states that were formed around Austria feared the return of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and put measures into place to prevent it from re-forming. Czechoslovakia was created through the merging of the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, previously under Austrian rule, united with Slovakia and Ruthenia, which were part of Hungary. Although these groups had many differences between them, they believed that together they would create a stronger state. The new country was a multi-ethnic state. The population consisted of Czechs (51%), Slovaks (16%), Germans (22%), Hungarians (5%) and Rusyns (4%), with other ethnic groups making up 2%. Many of the Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians and Poles and some Slovaks, felt oppressed because the political elite did not generally allow political autonomy for minority ethnic groups. The state proclaimed the official ideology that there are no Czechs and Slovaks, but only one nation of Czechoslovaks (see Czechoslovakism), to the disagreement of Slovaks and other ethnic groups. Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II the conflict between the Czechs and the Slovaks surfaced again. After the war Hungary was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources. The loss of territory was similar to that of Austria after the breaking up the Austria-Hungary territory. They lost the territories of Transylvania, Slovakia, Croatia, Slavonia, Syrmia, and Banat. Italy incorporated the regions of Trieste and South Tyrol from Austria. The creation of a free and Independent Poland was one of Wilson's fourteen points. At the end of the 18th century the state of Poland was broken apart by Prussia, Russia, and Austria. During the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, the Commission on Polish Affairs was created which recommended there be a passageway across West Prussia and Posen, in order to give Poland access to the Baltic through the port of Danzig at the mouth of the Vistula River. The creation of the state of Poland would separate East Prussia from the rest of Germany, as it was before the Partitions of Poland. Poland also received Upper Silesia. British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon proposed Poland's eastern border with Russia.

The state of Romania was enlarged greatly after the war. As a result of the Paris peace conference Romania kept the Dobrudja and Transylvania. Between the states of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania an alliance named the Little Entente was formed. They worked together on matters of foreign policy in order to prevent a Habsburg restoration. Initially Yugoslavia began as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. The State secured its territory at the Paris peace talks after the end of the war. The state suffered from many internal problems because of the many diverse cultures and languages within the state. Yugoslavia was divided on national, linguistic, economic, and religious lines.\n\nquestion: What was the Eastern Front in World War I?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 234}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The Eastern Front of the First World War was roughly delimited by the Baltic Sea in the west; Minsk in the east; Saint Petersburg in the north; and the Black Sea in the south; a distance of more than 1,600 kilometers. The entire frontier had the Russian Empire and Romania on one side; and the Central Powers on the other. The Eastern Front saw the Central Powers defeating the Russian Empire in several major battles. This ultimately led to Russian withdrawal from WW1 through the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Here are the major battles and events of World War I on the Eastern Front including their dates, places and nations involved. Date: August 17, 1914 The Russian military was the largest in the world consisting of 1.4 million men prior to the war. Contrary to their enemy\u2019s expectations, the Russians were able to mobilize enough men within 2 weeks. Two Russian armies were sent to East Prussia in Germany, and four armies were sent to invade the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia. Date: August 23 to September 11, 1914, aka Battle of Lemberg By August 23, 1914, Austro-Hungarian 1st, 3rd and 4th Armies were concentrated in Galicia with the aim of invading Russian Poland. They now faced the Russian 3rd, 4th, 5th and 8th Armies in the major Battle of Galicia. The Austro-Hungarian armies were severely defeated and forced out of Galicia, while the Russians captured Lemberg. As the Austrians retreated, many Slavic soldiers in the Austro-Hungarian Army surrendered and some even offered to fight for the Russians. The Austro Hungarian casualties numbered in excess of 400,000 while that of the Russians were at 225,000. Date: August 26 \u2013 30, 1914 The German Eighth Army launched a surprise attack on the invading Russian 2nd Army and won a decisive battle near Tannenberg. The Russian 1st Army was also routed in subsequent engagements and there were 170,000 Russian casualties with minimal loss to the Germans. Date: September 7 \u2013 14, 1914 In a German offensive, General Paul von Rennenkampf\u2019s Russian First Army was pushed back and eventually out of German territory by the General Hindenburg\u2019s German Eighth Army. A German advance was however halted by the arrival of the Russian Tenth Army. Date: September 16, 1914 \u2013 March 22, 1915 As the Austro-Hungarian forces fell back over 160 kilometers to the Carpathian Mountains after the Battle of Galicia, the fortress of Przemy\u015bl was the only Austrian post to hold out. The Siege of Przemy\u015bl, the longest siege of the First World War, ended in a complete Russian victory a few months later. Date: October 29, 1914 The Ottomans, with the help of the Germans, carried a naval sortie in the Black Sea ports of Russia. The attack was conceived by Ottoman War Minister Enver Pasha and led to the entry of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. They would officially declare war on the 11th of November. Date: February 7 \u2013 22, 1915 The German Eighth and Tenth Armies launched a winter offensive with the intent of advancing beyond the Vistula River. The battle ended in a German victory giving them a toehold in Russian territory. However, the Russian Tenth Army was able to halt any further advance. In the following weeks, the Germans drove the Russians out of their remaining small enclaves in East Prussia. Date: May 2 \u2013 June 22, 1915 The Austro-Hungarians had faced considerable reverses since the beginning of the war. Due to this, they looked for German support on the Eastern Front. A joint offensive under General August von Mackensen was thus planned and launched in the Gorlice Tarnow area, southeast of Krakow. Initially conceived as a minor effort to relieve pressure on the Austro Hungarians, the offensive was a striking success for the Central Forces, who were able to decisively defeat the Russian III Army, recapture Galicia along with Przemy\u015bl and advance for miles within Russian territory. Date: July \u2013 September 1915 Suffering heavy casualties and loss of military equipment, the Imperial Russian Army was ordered to retreat from the Galicia Poland salient by the Russian Stavka, the high command of the armed forces in the Russian Empire. A strategic retreat was therefore conducted to shorten the front lines and avoid the potential encirclement of large Russian forces in the salient. The German advance was halted by Russian counterattacks in late September, and a new frontline was established from the Baltic Sea through Belarusian forests to the Romanian border.

The operation was a total failure for the Russians. Date: June 4 \u2013 September 20, 1916 The southwestern front of the Imperial Russian Army under General Aleksei Brusilov, launched one of their most successful, and the most lethal offensive in World War I. Four Russian armies were round up and the attack began on 4th June with a massive artillery barrage on Austro Hungarian lines. The offensive would end in September when the Russian resources began running out. The Austro Hungarians had by now lost close to 1,000,000 men as casualties and 25,000 sq. km of territory. Due to this, Germany had to aid its ally and send divisions from the Western Front. This, in turn, would ruin German plans on the Western Front. Date: February 18 \u2013 March 3, 1918 The last major action on the Eastern Front began with Operation Faustschlag (\u201cOperation Fist Punch\u201d). This offensive by the Central Powers saw little Russian resistance due to the turmoil of the Russian Revolution and the subsequent Russian Civil War. Huge territories were captured in the Baltics, Belarus and Ukraine, forcing the Bolshevik government of Russia to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which officially ended Russian participation in the First World War.

Our editors will review what you\u2019ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. The Eastern Front was a major theatre of combat during World War I that included operations on the main Russian front as well as campaigns in Romania. The main front was divided into three \u201csub-theatres\u201d\u2014with campaigns in the German province of East Prussia in the north, Austrian Galicia in the south, and the Russian-held Polish salient in between\u2014each of which had its own unique characteristics. The Eastern Front stretched across eastern Europe from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south. This was a span of some 800 miles (roughly 1,300 km) in a direct line\u2014or more than twice that distance if measured along the borders between the opposing countries. On the Eastern Front, Germany and other members of the Central Powers, such as Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, fought against Russia and Romania of the Allied and Associated Powers. While much of the fighting on the Western Front was characterized by trench warfare and stalemates, fighting on the Eastern Front was more conventional, involving fluid movements of armies in massive offensives and counteroffensives. Fighting on the Eastern Front ended on March 3, 1918, when a peace treaty between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers was signed at Brest-Litovsk. To understand why the treaty was signed, one must go back to early 1917. Military defeats and economic instability had shaken the Russian Empire and led to the fall, in February 1917, of Tsar Nicholas II\u2019s government. This government was replaced by a short-lived Provisional Government. On October 24\u201325 (November 6\u20137, New Style) Vladimir Lenin\u2019s Bolsheviks and their Left Socialist Revolutionary allies staged a coup d'\u00e9tat, later called the Bolshevik Revolution. One day after taking power, Lenin published two decrees that dissolved the Eastern Front overnight, increased chaos in Russia, and made very difficult any organized resistance to communist rule. His Land Decree, which abolished landed estates without compensation to their owners, drew Russian soldiers away from the front line and back to their home villages. His Peace Decree offered the peoples of all the belligerent states peace negotiations on the basis that there should be no annexations and no indemnities and that the right of self-determination should be recognized for all. On November 26, 1917, the Soviet of People\u2019s Commissars, as the new communist government was called, unilaterally ordered the cessation of hostilities on Russia\u2019s European and Transcaucasian fronts. Russia\u2019s armistice with the Central Powers was signed on December 15, 1917. Subsequently, however, Germany pushed for Russia to accept the Central Powers\u2019 peace terms by launching its armies into the newly constituted Ukrainian National Republic, across the armistice lines in Belorussia and Latvia, and even into Estonia. This forced Lenin\u2019s hand, and the peace treaty was signed on March 3, 1918. As a result, Russia recognized both Finland and Ukraine as independent; renounced control over Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and most of Belorussia; and ceded Kars, Ardahan, and Batumi in Transcaucasia to the Ottoman Empire. Eastern Front, major theatre of combat during World War I that included operations on the main Russian front as well as campaigns in Romania. The principal belligerents were Russia and Romania (of the Allied and Associated Powers) versus the Central Powers countries of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria. The Eastern Front, which stretched from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south, was more than twice as long as the Western Front. The greater distances and greater differences between the equipment and quality of the armies involved ensured a fluidity of combat which was lacking in the west. In August 1914 the Russian and Austro-Hungarian\u2013German armies faced each other across a frontier that stretched over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from the Baltic Sea to the northern border of Romania, which was at that time neutral. This great length was due to the projection of Russian Poland as a huge salient between German East Prussia and Austrian Galicia. After Romania joined in the war on the side of the Allies in 1916, the front extended from the Baltic to the Black Sea, a span of some 800 miles (roughly 1,300 km) in a direct line, or more than twice that distance if measured along the borders between the opposing countries. The shape of the frontier, the great distances, and the physical features and nature of the communications combined to divide the Eastern Front into three \u201csub-theatres\u201d until the Russian retreat out of Poland in 1915. Thus, the operations in East Prussia, in the Polish salient, and in Galicia, though they formed part of a combined whole, each had their own special characteristics.

The only heights sufficient to constitute a serious military obstacle were the Carpathians, which extended in a semicircle from the southwest corner of the Polish salient to the Iron Gate on the Danube, forming a protective barrier for the Hungarian plains on the north and east. Opposite Russia they ran roughly parallel to the frontier, some 50\u2013100 miles (80\u2013160 km) from it; opposite Romania the Carpathians actually marked the frontier. It was a constant aim of the Russians throughout their operations, as well as the objective of Romania\u2019s single abortive offensive, to pierce this barrier and reach the plains below. Although the Eastern Front had but a single notable mountain barrier, the water obstacles in the theatre were numerous and formidable. The most significant from a strategic standpoint was the Pripet Marshes, a vast waterlogged wetland covering approximately 104,000 square miles (270,000 square km), where infrastructure was undeveloped and military movements on a large scale were extremely difficult in consequence. Other water lines which had a considerable effect on operations were: in East Prussia, the line of the Masurian lakes; in the Polish salient, the rivers Vistula, Narew, Bobr, Niemen, and Bug; in Galicia, the Dunajec, Wis\u0142ok, San, and Dniester; and in the Romanian theatre, the Danube itself, the Olt, and the Siret. Besides the rivers enumerated above, there were a number of lesser streams which influenced the course and direction of the operations. Strategy in this theatre was in fact largely determined by rivers. Rivers slow the movement of an advancing army but are seldom a permanent bar to its progress. Although many of the principal river crossings had been fortified in peace, these fortifications had little influence on the course of operations\u2014except, notably, at Przemy\u015bl. In East Prussia and in Poland were extensive stretches of forest, which had certain tactical consequences. The Carpathians also were thickly wooded. The real key to strategy on this eastern European front lay in the communications and logistics systems. In this respect the contrast between Russia and its western neighbours was striking. The transportation system in Russia was extremely underdeveloped, in spite of all efforts in the years preceding the war to develop strategic railways. The Russian general staff had prevented road or railway construction in the north and in the southeast of the Polish salient in order to provide protection to a defensive position in the centre of the salient. This shortsighted policy seriously hampered Russian strategy when an offensive campaign from Poland was undertaken. Nor could Russia make much use of its great rivers as lines of supply, owing to lack of previous development. Thus, superior command and communications infrastructure gave Russia\u2019s adversaries the inestimable advantage of greater mobility. The armies that met on the Eastern Front were all conscript forces. Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Germany required three to four years of service from able-bodied males of military age, to be followed by several years in reserve formations. Military strength was counted in terms of divisions (12,000\u201320,000 officers and men), the smallest military units capable of independent action. In August 1914 the Russian army consisted of 102 regular divisions divided into six field armies, boasting a total manpower of some 1.4 million. Germany\u2019s eight field armies consisted of 98 regular divisions, supplemented by 27 Landwehr (reserve) brigades, for a total strength of 1.9 million men; although this force was significantly larger than Russia\u2019s army, it would have to be deployed on two fronts. Austria-Hungary\u2019s six field armies were divided into 48 divisions, with a total manpower of some 450,000. Of the Germans little else need be said; their army of 1914 was among the most powerful instruments of war the world had yet seen. The raw material of the Russian army was in many ways excellent. The typical Russian infantryman was noted for his discipline and bravery, but he often lacked leadership, as the army did not possess a deep well of officers and senior enlisted men from which to draw. Once the original cadre of regular officers and noncommissioned officers had fallen, there were few candidates to replace them, because the Russian system did not produce reserve officers with great efficiency. The Russian army was very weak on the technical side; it was lacking in artillery, and it fielded large masses of cavalry, provision for which threw a great strain on the communications and logistics systems, but which accomplished little. In no way\u2014except by weight of numbers\u2014could a Russian army hope to gain the advantage over a German force. The Austro-Hungarian army, only slightly, if at all, superior to the Russian on the technical side, was inferior to it in fighting quality. This was in large part due to a senior officer corps that was mediocre at best. Austro-Hungarian troops\n\nquestion: How long was the Eastern Front compared to the Western Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1114}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A Russian force was almost always the master of an Austro-Hungarian force of similar size, but it required a great numerical preponderance to meet a force of Germans with any hope of success. The high state of discipline, training, leadership, and armament of the German army reduced the significance of the initial numerical inferiority of the armies of the Central Powers. Due to the comparative slowness of mobilization, poor higher leadership, and lower scale of armament of the Russian armies, there was an approximate balance of forces in August 1914 which prevented one side from gaining a quick victory. The Russian military expert Gen. Nikolai N. Golovin rated one German division as the equivalent of one and a half Russian divisions. Germany and Austria-Hungary also enjoyed the advantage of interior lines of communication which enabled them to send their forces to critical points on the battlefronts by the shortest route. According to Gen. Wilhelm Groener, Germany\u2019s railway network made it possible to move eight divisions simultaneously from the Western Front to the Eastern Front in four and a half days. Even greater in importance was the advantage that Germany derived from military traditions and a system of command dating back to the reforms of Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst, Count Neidhardt von Gneisenau, Count von Roon, and the elder Helmuth von Moltke. Skilled in directing a war of movement and quick to exploit the advantages of flank attacks, German senior officers, with the exception of Moltke\u2019s namesake nephew, were capable of successfully directing the operations of large formations. The German plan of 1914 was a modification of one drawn up by Alfred von Schlieffen many years previously. It provided for an offensive against France designed to obtain a rapid and decisive victory and a defensive in the east against Russia until the decision had been obtained in the west. The choice of France for the initial offensive was actuated chiefly by the relative slowness of Russian mobilization and by the impossibility of gaining a rapid decision against Russia owing to the great distances. Germany\u2019s problem in the east was then to determine the minimum strength to be left for defensive purposes. This was eventually fixed at nine divisions, active and reserve, with one cavalry division, for the protection of East Prussia. Certain second-line troops were tasked with the defense of the Eastern Front fortresses such as Posen (now Pozna\u0144, Poland), Thorn (now Toru\u0144, Poland), Danzig (now Gda\u0144sk, Poland), and Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) and to watch the Polish frontier. The troops in East Prussia, organized into four corps, formed the Eighth Army under Max von Prittwitz. The chief of the Austro-Hungarian general staff, Franz, Graf Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, had planned an offensive into southeast Poland between the Vistula and Bug rivers, directed at Che\u0142m and Lublin. This was to be carried out by the First and Fourth armies (under Gen. Viktor Dankl and Gen. Moritz von Auffenberg, respectively). To protect their right flank and rear, the Second and Third armies (under Gen. Hermann K\u00f6vess and Gen. Rudolf von Brudermann) deployed east of Halicz and Lemberg. Conrad\u2019s offensive was originally designed as part of a combined Austro-Hungarian\u2013German offensive, in which German forces from East Prussia were simultaneously to attack along the Narew River. German and Austro-Hungarian forces were to meet about Siedlce and thus cut off the whole Polish salient. Conrad had repeatedly urged this plan on Moltke but had failed to induce him to provide sufficient troops to take the offensive from East Prussia, before France had been disposed of. In the absence of German cooperation, it is difficult to see what permanent success Conrad could have hoped for from the proposed Che\u0142m-Lublin offensive, because, as already pointed out, the Russians had neglected the infrastructure in that area expressly to frustrate the operation he had chosen. From the German point of view, however, this Austro-Hungarian offensive fitted in admirably with their strategic plan, because, whatever its outcome, it would keep the Russians fully engaged and thus safeguard the vital industrial areas of Silesia, until the campaign against France had been won. The Russians had accurately gauged the intentions of both their adversaries. Their original plan was to take the offensive against the Austro-Hungarian armies in Galicia and to act defensively in the Polish salient and against the Germans in East Prussia. They were, however, pledged to their French allies to assume the offensive against Germany at the earliest possible date. Six armies were initially deployed along the front line. The First (or Vilna) Army under Gen. Paul von Rennenkampf assembled on the eastern frontier of East Prussia, and\n\nquestion: How long was the Eastern Front compared to the Western Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1104}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

These two armies formed the Northwestern Front, under Gen. Yakov Grigoryevich Zhilinsky. They were intended for action against the German forces in East Prussia. The Southwestern Front, under Gen. Nikolai Ivanov, consisted of four armies, of which the Fourth (under Gen. Anton Salza) and Fifth (under Gen. Paul von Plehwe) were to deploy on the Lublin-Che\u0142m railway to meet the expected Austro-Hungarian offensive; the Third Army (Gen. Nikolai Ruzski) and Eighth Army (Gen. Aleksey Brusilov) were to take the offensive at once from the eastern frontier of Galicia in the direction of Lemberg (now Lviv, Ukraine). The Austro-Hungarian and Russian plans were almost the exact counterpart of each other. Grand Duke Nicholas assumed chief command of the Russian armies as a whole. Though no great strategist, he was shrewd and had a strong personality. His chief of staff, Gen. Nikolai Yanushkevich, was a man of no significant military ability who owed his position to his charisma at court. The Russian war plan was attributed mainly to Gen. Yuri Danilov, head of the operations branch of the general staff. In addition to the front line armies, the Sixth Army was assembled at Petrograd for the protection of the capital and as a general reserve, the Seventh Army at Odessa to guard the Black Sea coast, and an army in the Caucasus to watch Turkey. At the last moment, after mobilization, a momentous change in the Russian dispositions was made. The First and Second armies were ordered to invade East Prussia at once, without waiting to complete their concentration. This change was made solely to assist Russia\u2019s allies in the west. Rennenkampf\u2019s First Army comprised six and a half infantry divisions and five cavalry divisions, and Samsonov\u2019s Second Army was made up of 10 infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions. They had thus in combination an overwhelming superiority over Gen. Max von Prittwitz\u2019s Eighth Army, which was defending East Prussia. Coordination between them was, however, completely lacking and led to their defeat in detail. Zhilinsky, who was responsible for combining the action of the two armies, was a man of some administrative capacity but little aptitude for command. Samsonov\u2019s army had to move before its concentration was completed and was deficient in transport. The arrangements for obtaining and recording intelligence were indifferent in spite of the large masses of cavalry available. So defective were the means of communication that the Russians were frequently forced to issue \u201cin clear\u201d (unencrypted) orders by wireless, with the result that the Germans often had complete information of their enemy\u2019s moves and intentions. With the German declaration of war against Russia on August 1, 1914, all hope had been lost of the conflict between Serbia and Austria-Hungary remaining a localized affair. Armies were already mobilizing along what would become the Eastern Front. Rennenkampf crossed the frontier on August 17, driving back a German force at Stallup\u00f6nen (now Nesterov, Russia). After a hard battle at Gumbinnen (August 19\u201320), Rennenkampf defeated Prittwitz, who had concentrated against him the bulk of his army, leaving only one corps to observe the southern frontier. Meanwhile, Samsonov, moving slowly forward by M\u0142awa, crossed into East Prussia on August 21, causing Prittwitz, in momentary panic, to announce his intention of withdrawing behind the Vistula. Prittwitz was promptly replaced by Paul von Hindenburg, with Erich Ludendorff as chief of staff. Within a week Ludendorff had completely defeated the Second Army at the Battle of Tannenberg (August 26\u201330, 1914), surrounding and capturing the greater portion of it. Receiving a reinforcement of two corps which had been hastily recalled from France, Ludendorff then turned on Rennenkampf, who had remained inactive during the disaster at Tannenberg. From September 1 to September 15 Rennenkampf was attacked and driven out of East Prussia with very heavy casualties at the Battle of Masurian Lakes. In these operations the Russians had suffered a total loss of some 250,000 men, crippling in spite of Russia\u2019s immense reserves. Much war mat\u00e9riel had also been lost, and this could not easily be replaced. On the other hand, this invasion of East Prussia, by causing the recall of two corps from the west at the moment of France\u2019s crisis, had made possible the victory at the Marne. Meanwhile, in Galicia, Austria-Hungary had suffered a serious defeat at the hands of Ivanov\u2019s Southwestern army group.

However, their flank guard of the Second and Third armies was unable to withstand the onslaught of the Russian Third and Eighth armies. On September 2 Lemberg was lost, and the advance of the victorious left wing was consequently stayed. Two corps from the Russian Ninth Army (which had been formed at Warsaw as a central reserve) now reinforced Ivanov\u2019s right wing, and the whole Austro-Hungarian line was gradually pressed back. On September 11 a retirement to the San was ordered by the Austro-Hungarian command; by the end of the month they had withdrawn to within 50 miles (80 km) of Krak\u00f3w, leaving their fortress of Przemy\u015bl to withstand an extended siege. The Austro-Hungarian defeat in Galicia compelled the German Supreme Command to send direct assistance to its reeling ally. This was done by the transfer of five and a half corps, formed into the Ninth Army, from East Prussia to the Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa front. From there the Ninth Army marched on Warsaw in the last days of September in conjunction with a simultaneous advance along the whole Austro-Hungarian front up to the Carpathians. The Russians had halted on the San after the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian forces and were in the process of transferring troops north to form a new front south of Warsaw. This regrouping was carried out in safety behind the Vistula, with only cavalry being left to oppose the German advance west of the river. By the middle of October, the German Ninth Army was near Warsaw, but the Austro-Hungarian advance had been held up on the San. The Russians now counterattacked all along the line. In the south they drove the Austro-Hungarian forces back to the Dunajec River, in the centre they compelled the German Ninth Army to fall back, and in the north the newly constituted Russian Tenth Army crossed the frontiers of East Prussia. The intention of Grand Duke Nicholas, the Russian commander in chief, was now to invade Silesia with his Fifth, Fourth, and Ninth armies, in that order from the north. His right flank was to be protected by the Tenth Army in the east of East Prussia and by the First and Second armies north and west of Warsaw, his left flank by the advance of the Third and Eighth armies in Galicia. The Germans had thoroughly broken up the infrastructure in southwest Poland during their retreat, and the Russian advance was slow and halting. Their more nimble opponents once again used the superior mobility given them by their highly developed network of railways to launch a telling counterstrike. A German Eastern Front Command was constituted under Hindenburg and Ludendorff, and the German Ninth Army, now under Gen. August von Mackensen, was withdrawn from southwest Poland and concentrated between Posen and Torun. It advanced on November 11, with its left flank on the Vistula, against the right flank and rear of the Russian main armies. The Russian First and Second armies were severely mauled, and by November 17 the Second Army was in a critical situation, almost completely surrounded at \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. It was saved by a skillful intervention by Russian Gen. Paul von Plehwe\u2019s Fifth Army, and the Germans were now themselves faced with envelopment and disaster. Thanks to Rennenkampf\u2019s failure to act with due haste, however, they extricated themselves from danger. Four corps from the Western Front were released with the conclusion of the First Battle of Ypres, and these now joined Mackensen. This enabled him again to advance and to capture \u0141owicz and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a by December 12. In the south, heavy fighting had taken place east of Krak\u00f3w with no decisive result.\n\nquestion: How long was the Eastern Front compared to the Western Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 875}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It ranged from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south, involved most of Eastern Europe, and stretched deep into Central Europe. The term contrasts with the Western Front, which was being fought in Belgium and France. During 1910, Russian General Yuri Danilov developed \"Plan 19\" under which four armies would invade East Prussia. This plan was criticised as Austria-Hungary could be a greater threat than the German Empire. So instead of four armies invading East Prussia, the Russians planned to send two armies to East Prussia, and two armies to defend against Austro-Hungarian forces invading from Galicia. In the opening months of the war, the Imperial Russian Army attempted an invasion of eastern Prussia in the Northwestern theater, only to be beaten back by Germany after some initial success. At the same time, in the south, they successfully invaded Galicia, defeating the Austro-Hungarian forces there. In Russian Poland, the Germans failed to take Warsaw. But by 1915, the German and Austro-Hungarian forces were on the advance, dealing the Russians heavy casualties in Galicia and in Poland, forcing them to retreat. Grand Duke Nicholas was sacked from his position as the commander-in-chief and replaced by Tsar Nicholas himself. Several offensives against the Germans in 1916 failed, including the Lake Naroch Offensive and the Baranovichi Offensive. However, General Aleksei Brusilov oversaw a highly successful operation against Austria-Hungary that became known as the Brusilov offensive, which saw the Russian Army make large gains. Being the largest and most lethal offensive of World War I, the effects of the Brusilov offensive were far reaching. It helped to relieve the German pressure during the Battle of Verdun, while also helping to relieve the Austro-Hungarian pressure on the Italians. As a result, the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces were fatally weakened, and finally Romania decided to enter the war on the side of the Allies. However, the Russian human and material losses also greatly contributed to the Russian Revolutions. Romania entered the war in August 1916. The Allied Powers promised the region of Transylvania (which was part of Austria-Hungary) in return for Romanian support. The Romanian Army invaded Transylvania and had initial successes, but was forced to stop and was pushed back by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians when Bulgaria attacked them from the south. Meanwhile, a revolution occurred in Russia in March 1917 (one of the causes being the hardships of the war). Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate and a Russian Provisional Government was founded, with Georgy Lvov as its first leader, who was eventually replaced by Alexander Kerensky. The newly formed Russian Republic continued to fight the war alongside Romania and the rest of the Entente in desultory fashion. It was overthrown by the Bolsheviks in November 1917. Following the Armistice of Foc\u0219ani between Romania and the Central Powers, Romania also signed a peace treaty with the Central Powers on 7 May 1918, however it was canceled by Romania on 10 November 1918. The new government established by the Bolsheviks signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers in March 1918, taking it out of the war; leading to a Central Powers victory on the Eastern Front and Russian defeat in World War I. The front in the east was much longer than that in the west. The theater of war was roughly delimited by the Baltic Sea in the west and Minsk in the east, and Saint Petersburg in the north and the Black Sea in the south, a distance of more than 1,600 kilometres (990 mi). This had a drastic effect on the nature of the warfare. While the war on the Western Front developed into trench warfare, the battle lines on the Eastern Front were much more fluid and trenches never truly developed. This was because the greater length of the front ensured that the density of soldiers in the line was lower so the line was easier to break. Once broken, the sparse communication networks made it difficult for the defender to rush reinforcements to the rupture in the line, mounting rapid counteroffensives to seal off any breakthrough. Propaganda was a key component of the culture of World War I. It was often shown through state-controlled media, and helped to bolster nationalism and patriotism within countries. On the Eastern Front, propaganda took many forms such as opera, film, spy fiction, theater\n\nquestion: How long was the Eastern Front compared to the Western Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "More than 1,600 kilometres (990 mi)", "usage": 1121}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Across the Eastern Front the amount of propaganda used in each country varied from state to state. Propaganda took many forms within each country and was distributed by many different groups. Most commonly the state produced propaganda, but other groups, such as anti-war organizations, also generated propaganda. Prior to the outbreak of war, German strategy was based almost entirely on the so-called Schlieffen Plan. With the Franco-Russian Agreement in place, Germany knew that war with either of these combatants would result in war with the other, which meant that there would be war in both the west and the east (two-front war). Therefore, the German General Staff, under Alfred von Schlieffen and then Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, planned a quick, all-out ground war on the Western Front to take France and, upon victory, Germany would turn its attention to Russia in the east. Schlieffen believed Russia would not be ready or willing to move against and attack Germany due to the huge losses of military equipment that Russia had suffered in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905, its low population density and lack of railroads. Conversely, the Imperial German Navy believed it could be victorious over Britain with Russian neutrality, something which Moltke knew would not be possible. In the immediate years preceding the First World War, the Kingdom of Romania was involved in the Second Balkan War on the side of Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and the Ottoman Empire against Bulgaria. The Treaty of Bucharest, signed on 10 August 1913, ended the Balkan conflict and added 6,960 square kilometers to Romania's territory. Although militarized, Romania decided upon a policy of neutrality at the start of the First World War, mainly due to having territorial interests in both Austria-Hungary (Transylvania and Bukovina) and in Russia (Bessarabia). Strong cultural influences also affected Romanian leanings, however. King Carol I, as a Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, favoured his Germanic roots, while the Romanian people, influenced by their Orthodox church and Latin-based language, were inclined to join France. Perhaps King Carol's attempts at joining the war on the side of the Central powers would have been fruitful had he not died in 1914, but Romanian disenchantment with Austria-Hungary had already influenced public and political opinion. French endorsement of Romanian action against Bulgaria, and support of the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest was particularly effective at inclining Romania towards the Entente. Furthermore, Russian courting of Romanian sympathies, exemplified by the visit of the Tsar to Constan\u021ba on 14 June 1914, signaled in a new era of positive relations between the two countries. Nevertheless, King Ferdinand I of Romania maintained a policy of neutrality, intending to gain the most for Romania by negotiating between competing powers. The result of the negotiations with the Entente was the Treaty of Bucharest (1916), which stipulated the conditions under which Romania agreed to join the war on the side of the Entente, particularly territorial promises in Austria-Hungary: Transylvania, Cri\u0219ana and Maramure\u0219, the whole Banat and most of Bukovina. According to historian John Keegan, these enticements offered by the Allies were never concrete, for in secret, Russia and France agreed not to honor any conventions when the end of the war came. The immediate reason for Russia's involvement in the First World War was a direct result of the decisions made by the statesmen and generals during July 1914. The July Crisis was the culmination of a series of diplomatic conflicts that took place in the decades prior to 1914, and this is fundamental to an understanding of Russia's position immediately prior to the War. According to D. C. Lieven, Russia was formidable and was able to back up her diplomatic policies with force. One of the most significant factors in bringing Russia to the brink of war was the downfall of her economy. The 20 percent jump in defense expenditure during 1866\u201377 forced them to change their position within Europe and shift the balance of power out of her favour. At the time, Russian infrastructure was backward and the Russian government had to invest far more than its European rivals in structural changes. In addition there were overwhelming burdens of defense, which would ultimately result in an economic downfall for the Russians. This was a major strain on the Russian population, but also served as a direct threat to military expenditure. Thus the only way the Russians could sustain the strains of European war would be to place more emphasis on foreign investment from the French who essentially came to Russia's aid for industrial change. The Franco-Russian Alliance allowed for the Russian defense to grow and aid the European balance of power during the growth of the German Empire's might. Nevertheless, one of the key factors was that of the Russian foreign policy between 1890 and 1914. The Russian army was large, but had poor leadership and poor equipment, and increasingly poor morale until by\n\nquestion: How long was the Eastern Front compared to the Western Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1116}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In order for the Russians to legitimize their war efforts, the government constructed an image of the enemy through state-instituted propaganda. Their main aim was to help overcome the legend of the \"invincible\" German war machine, in order to boost the morale of civilians and soldiers. Russian propaganda often took the form of showing the Germans as a civilized nation, with barbaric \"inhuman\" traits. Russian propaganda also exploited the image of the Russian POWs who were in the German camps, again in order to boost the morale of their troops, serving as encouragement to defeat the enemy and to get their fellow soldiers out of German POW camps that were perceived as inhumane. An element of the Russian propaganda was the Investigate Commission formed in April 1915. It was led by Aleksei Krivtsov, and the study was tasked with the job of studying the legal violations committed by of the Central Powers and then getting this information to the Russian public. This commission published photographs of letters that were allegedly found on fallen German soldiers. These letters document the German correspondents saying to \"take no prisoners.\" A museum was also set up in Petrograd, which displayed pictures that showed how \"inhumanly\" the Germans were treating prisoners of war. Also, the Russians chose to discard the name Saint Petersburg to remove the German-sounding \"Saint\" and \"-burg\", favouring the more Russian-sounding Petrograd. Austria-Hungary's participation in the outbreak of World War I has been neglected by historians, as emphasis has traditionally been placed on Germany's role as the prime instigator. However, the \"spark\" that ignited the First World War is attributed to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, which took place on 28 June 1914. Approximately a month later, on 28 July 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This act led to a series of events that would quickly expand into the First World War; thus, the Habsburg government in Vienna initiated the pivotal decision that would begin the conflict. The causes of the Great War have generally been defined in diplomatic terms, but certain deep-seated issues in Austria-Hungary undoubtedly contributed to the beginnings of the First World War. The Austro-Hungarian situation in the Balkans pre-1914 is a primary factor in its involvement in the war. The movement towards South Slav unity was a major problem for the Habsburg Empire, which was facing increasing nationalist pressure from its multinational populace. As Europe's third largest state, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was hardly homogeneous; comprising over fifty million people and eleven nationalities, the Empire was a conglomeration of a number of diverse cultures, languages, and peoples. Specifically, the South Slavic people of Austria-Hungary desired to amalgamate with Serbia in an effort to officially solidify their shared cultural heritage. Over seven million South Slavs lived inside the Empire, while three million lived outside it. With the growing emergence of nationalism in the twentieth century, unity of all South Slavs looked promising. This tension is exemplified by Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf's letter to Franz Ferdinand: The unification of the South Slav race is one of the powerful national movements which can neither be ignored nor kept down. The question can only be, whether unification will take place within the boundaries of the Monarchy \u2013 that is at the expense of Serbia's independence \u2013 or under Serbia's leadership at the expense of the Monarchy. The cost to the Monarchy would be the loss of its South Slav provinces and thus of almost its entire coastline. The loss of territory and prestige would relegate the Monarchy to the status of a small power. The annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908 by Austrian foreign minister Baron von Aehrenthal in an effort to assert domination over the Balkans inflamed Slavic nationalism and angered Serbia. Bosnia-Herzegovina became a \"rallying cry\" for South Slavs, with hostilities between Austria-Hungary and Serbia steadily increasing. The situation was ripe for conflict, and when the Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Austrian imperial heir, Franz Ferdinand, these longstanding hostilities culminated into an all-out war. The Allied Powers wholeheartedly supported the Slavs' nationalistic fight. George Macaulay Trevelyan, a British historian, saw Serbia's war against Austria-Hungary as a \"war of liberation\" that would \"free South Slavs from tyranny.\" In his own words: \"If ever there was a battle for freedom, there is such a battle now going on in Southeastern Europe against Austrian and Magyar. If this war ends in the overthrow of the Magyar tyranny, an immense step forward will have been taken toward racial liberty and European peace.\" Prior to 1915, the Russians' lack of success in war and diplomacy in the six decades before 1914 sapped the country's moral strength. The triumphs of Britain and Germany in the martial, diplomatic and economic spheres put these\n\nquestion: How long was the Eastern Front compared to the Western Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1129}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This was a source of national pride, self-confidence and unity. It helped reconcile the worker to the state and the Bavarian or Scotsman to rule from Berlin or London. In the years prior to 1914, Austro-Russian co-operation was both crucial for European peace and difficult to maintain. Old suspicions exacerbated by the Bosnian crisis stood in the way of agreement between the two empires, as did ethnic sensitivities. Russia's historical role as liberator of the Balkans was difficult to square with Austria's determination to control adjacent territories.  In 1913\u20131914 Saint Petersburg was too concerned with its own weakness and what it saw as threats to vital Russian interests, to spare much thought for Vienna's feelings. The Russians were, with some justice, indignant that the concessions they had made after the First Balkan War in the interest of European peace had not been reciprocated by the Central Powers. This was doubly dangerous given the growing evidence flowing into Petersburg about Germany's aggressive intentions. Both Bazarov and the agents of the Russian secret political police in Germany reported the concern aroused in public opinion by the press war against Russia, which raged in the spring of 1914. The Russian military was the largest in the world consisting of 1.4 million men on duty just prior to the war. They could also mobilize up to 5 million men, but only had 4.6 million rifles to give them. It also had poor leadership. The war in the east began with the Russian invasion of East Prussia on 17 August 1914 and the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia. The Russian offensive in the Battle of Stallup\u00f6nen, which was the opening battle of the Eastern Front, quickly turned to a disastrous defeat following the Battle of Tannenberg in August 1914; even though the Russians were successfully defending at Gumbinnen a while before Tannenberg. After the Russian disaster, German troops under the command of Hindenburg inflicted another crushing defeat on the numerically superior Russian army in the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes. A second Russian incursion into Galicia was more successful, with the Russians controlling almost all of that region by the end of 1914, routing four Austrian armies in the process. Under the command of Nikolai Ivanov, Nikolai Ruzsky and Aleksei Brusilov, the Russians won the Battle of Galicia in September and began the Siege of Przemy\u015bl, the next fortress on the road towards Krak\u00f3w. This early Russian success in 1914 on the Austro-Russian border was a reason for concern to the Central Powers and caused considerable German forces to be transferred to the East to take pressure off the Austrians, leading to the creation of the new German Ninth Army. The Austro-Hungarian government accepted the Polish proposal of establishing the Supreme National Committee as the Polish central authority within the Empire, responsible for the formation of the Polish Legions, an auxiliary military formation within the Austro-Hungarian army. At the end of 1914, the main focus of the fighting shifted to central part of Russian Poland, west of the river Vistula. The October Battle of the Vistula River and the November Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a brought little advancement for the Germans, but at least kept the Russians at a safe distance. The Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies continued to clash along the Carpathian Front throughout the winter of 1914\u20131915. Przemysl fortress managed to hold out deep behind enemy lines throughout this period, with the Russians bypassing it in order to attack the Austro-Hungarian troops further to the west. They made some progress, crossing the Carpathian Mountains in February and March 1915, but then the German relief helped the Austrians stop further Russian advances. In the meantime, Przemysl was almost entirely destroyed and the Siege of Przemysl ended in a defeat for the Austrians. In 1915 the Chief of German Great General Staff, General of Infantry Erich von Falkenhayn decided to make its main effort on the Eastern Front, and accordingly transferred considerable forces there. The year began with a successful German offensive in the area of the Masurian lakes. At the same time, a large battle for the city of Przasnysz took place on the Polish front. The city changed hands several times but eventually remained in Russian hands. As a result of the battle, the Germans lost 38 000 soldiers and Russian losses amounted to about 70 000 men. In May 1915, to eliminate the Russian threat the Central Powers began the successful Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive in Galicia. After the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, the German and Austro-Hungarian troops on the Eastern Front functioned under a unified command. The offensive soon turned into a general advance and a corresponding strategic retreat by the Russian Army. The cause of the reverses suffered by the Russian Army, despite a significant numerical superiority over the German enemy\n\nquestion: How long was the Eastern Front compared to the Western Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1134}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Only by 1916 did the buildup of Russian war industries increase the production of war material and improve the supply situation. By mid-1915, the Russians had been expelled from Russian Poland and hence pushed hundreds of kilometers away from the borders of the Central Powers, removing the threat of Russian invasion of Germany, although there was still slight Russian penetration into Austria-Hungary. At the end of 1915 the German-Austrian advance was stopped on the line Riga\u2013Jakobstadt\u2013D\u00fcnaburg\u2013Baranovichi\u2013Pinsk\u2013Dubno\u2013Tarnopol. The general outline of this front line did not change until the Russian collapse in 1917. During the campaign of 1915, the Russian Empire lost the entire line of western fortresses, and more than 4,000 guns. The causes of heavy defeats and losses of personnel, weapons, and as a result - vast territories (the entire Kingdom of Poland, part of the Baltic states, Grodno, partly Volhynia and Podolia provinces - up to 300,000 square kilometers) were to a large extent systemic shortcomings in the management of the armed forces and the defense industry. The multi-stage placement of military orders, their slow passage in the depths of the War Ministry, the disunity of the front and rear played a negative role. Thus, until the autumn of 1915, the Russian Supreme Commander-in-Chief only coordinated the actions of the commanders-in-chief of the armies of the fronts, distributed reinforcements, requesting them from the War Ministry. The Minister of War was responsible for organizing the production of weapons and ammunition, the implementation of the replenishment of troop personnel, military transportation outside the provinces declared a theater of military operations. The military districts in the theater of operations were subordinate to the commanders-in-chief of the armies of the fronts, but not to the Headquarters. Military production also lagged behind: until the end of autumn, the active army suffered from a shortage of rifles and ammunition, the consumption of which turned out to be incommensurable with the volume of production. Contemporaries also noted the isolation of the Russian commanding staff from the soldiers, the lack of practical warfare skills among the top-level commanders. \"We did have courage to send people to mass slaughter, hiding behind the difficulty of tactical responsibility, to slaughter often without purpose. We sent them, being ourselves far away, not seeing either our own or the enemy, and therefore not conforming to reality. Instead of punishment, we reward such leaders, because as far as the leaders were far away, the same, but still more, the higher leaders kept even more distant. People ceased to be people, but turned into pawns. We went to the fight in a state of some kind of oblivion and stunnedness\", wrote the representative of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Infantry General Fyodor Palitzin, in his diary. Failures in the Russian system of command and control of troops and the organization of hostilities occurred at other levels. Thus, serious shortcomings in reconnaissance led to the absence of any analysis of the enemy's plans and actions. With a general superiority in forces, almost every Central Powers's operation in 1915 was \"unexpected\" for the command from the front to the regimental level. Passion for undercover intelligence in the highest headquarters did not justify itself, and tactical intelligence was still based on barely reliable testimony of prisoners, in the absence of which the command up to the army, inclusive, was simply \"blind\". The separation of artillery from infantry with subordination to the inspectors of the corps and ammunition supply units (park brigades and divisions) created difficulties in the operational replenishment of ammunition and shells in the combat units. At the same time, huge stockpiles of ammunition were created in the fortresses, which were then delivered to the enemy during the retreat or destroyed due to the impossibility of evacuation. Special units were not created for the construction of fortifications in the rear of the troops. Most often, such work was hastily carried out by militia squads and the mobilized local population, sometimes including women, and then brought to the necessary defensive state by the combat units retreating on them, already exhausted by battles and night marches. The country\u2019s geographic expanses and a large population again became the salvation of the Russia from complete military defeat, however, by the end of the 1915 campaign, it became obvious that without a radical restructuring of the war strategy, methods of managing military potential, victory becomes unattainable, and new defeats can cause another collapse of transport (as in the case of mass exodus and the hasty \"evacuation\" of the western provinces), supplies, public administration and, as a result, the aggravation of the struggle for power in the country. Nevertheless, as before, for the military leadership of the Russian Empire, there was only one way to victory - the\n\nquestion: How long was the Eastern Front compared to the Western Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1119}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

To some extent, the Russian side in the autumn played along with E. von Falkenhayn, who, not considering the Russian direction to have at least some strategic prospect for achieving victory in the war, made it impossible to develop the offensive of the Eastern Front. After the Battle of Sarikamish, the Russo-Turkish front quickly turned in favor of Russian forces. The Turks were concerned with reorganizing their army and also fighting the massive Allied armada that landed in Galipoli. Meanwhile, Russia was preoccupied with other armies on the Eastern Front. However, the appointment of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich as Viceroy and Commander in the Caucasus in September 1915 revived the situation of the Russo-Turkish front. When the Allies withdrew from Gallipoli in December, the Caucasus Army's Chief of Staff General Nikolai Yudenich believed Turkish forces would take action against his army. This concern was legitimate: Bulgaria's entry into the war as Germany's ally in October caused serious alarm, as a land route from Germany to Turkey was now open and would allow for an unrestricted flow of German weapons to the Turks. A \"window of opportunity\" appeared that would allow the Russians to destroy the Turkish Third Army, as the British required assistance in Mesopotamia (now modern day Iraq). Britain's efforts to besiege Baghdad had been halted at Ctesiphon, and they were forced to retreat. This led to an increasing number of attacks by Turkish forces. The British requested the Russians to attack in an attempt to distract the Turks, and Yudenich agreed. The resulting offensive began on 10 January 1916. This offensive was unanticipated by the Turks, as it was in the middle of winter. The Turkish situation was exacerbated by the absences of Third Army's commander Kamil Pasha and Chief of Staff Major Guse. Coupled with an imbalance of forces \u2013 the Russians had 325,000 troops while the Turks only 78,000 \u2013 the situation appeared grim for the Central Powers. After three months of fighting, the Russians captured the city of Trabzon on 18 April 1916. Allied operations in 1916 were dictated by an urgent need to force Germany to transfer forces from its Western to Eastern fronts, to relieve the pressure on the French at the Battle of Verdun. This was to be accomplished by a series of Russian offensives which would force the Germans to deploy additional forces to counter them. The first such operation was the Lake Naroch Offensive in March\u2013April 1916, which ended in failure. The Italian operations during 1916 had one extraordinary result: Austrian divisions were pulled away from the Russian southern front. This allowed the Russian forces to organize a counter-offensive. The Brusilov offensive was a large tactical assault carried out by Russian forces against Austro-Hungarian forces in Galicia. General Aleksei Brusilov believed victory against the Central Powers was possible if close attention was paid to preparation. Brusilov suggested that the Russians should attack on a wide front, and to position their trenches a mere 75 yards (69 m) away from Austrian trenches. Brusilov's plan worked impeccably. The Russians outnumbered the Austrians 200,000 to 150,000, and held a considerable advantage in guns, with 904 large guns to 600. Most importantly innovative new tactics similar to those independently invented by Erwin Rommel were used to perform quick and effective close-range surprise attacks that allowed a steady advance. The Russian Eighth Army overwhelmed the Austrian Fourth and pushed on to Lutsk, advancing 40 miles (64 km) beyond the starting position. Over a million Austrians were lost, with over 500,000 men killed or taken prisoner by mid-June. Although the Brusilov offensive was initially successful, it slowed down considerably. An inadequate number of troops and poorly maintained supply lines hindered Brusilov's ability to follow up on the initial victories in June. The Brusilov offensive is considered to be the greatest Russian victory of the First World War.: 52 Although it cost the Russians half a million casualties only during the first two months offensive, the offensive successfully diverted substantial forces of the Central Powers from the Western front, and persuaded Romania to join the war, diverting even more Central Powers forces to the East. The development of the Russian armament industry was mainly supported by French investors before the war. The Russian High Command saw the reason for the losses of the war in the lack of munitions. Most of these supplies were lost when advancing German troops occupied the fortifications. The production of munitions in the Tsarist empire was difficult, confidence in private enterprise among army personnel was low, and little capital was invested in the industry until 1916. About fifty percent of Russian ammunition requirements were supplied by Britain and the USA. As the Western companies were also responsible for supplying the needs of the Western Front, only a small proportion of the required quantity could be transported to Russia. In the following year, the Russian armaments industry was able to increase its production figures by a factor of two and a half and, despite the insufficient help of the Allies\n\nquestion: How long was the Eastern Front compared to the Western Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1154}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It is no exaggeration to say that Roumania may be the turning-point of the campaign. If the Germans fail there it will be the greatest disaster inflicted upon them. Afterwards it will only be a question of time. But should Germany succeed I hesitate to think what the effect will be on the fortunes of the campaign. \u2026 and yet no one seems to have thought it his particular duty to prepare a plan... Up until 1916, the Romanians followed the tides of war with interest, while attempting to situate themselves in the most advantageous position. French and Russian diplomats had begun courting the Romanians early on, but persuasion tactics gradually intensified. For King Ferdinand to commit his force of half a million men, he expected the Allies to offer a substantial incentive. Playing on Romanian anti-Hungarian sentiment the Allies promised the Austria-Hungarian territory of Ardeal (Transylvania) to Romania. Transylvanian demographics strongly favoured the Romanians. Romania succumbed to Allied enticement on 18 August 1916. Nine days later, on 27 August, Romanian troops marched into Transylvania. Romania's entry into the war provoked major strategic changes for the Germans. In September 1916, German troops were mobilized to the Eastern Front. Additionally, the German Chief of the General Staff, General Erich Von Falkenhayn was forced to resign from office though his successor appointed him to command the combined Central Powers forces against Romania, along with General August von Mackensen. Kaiser Wilhelm II immediately replaced Falkenhayn with Paul von Hindenburg. Von Hindenburg's deputy, the more adept Erich Ludendorff, was given effective control of the army and ordered to advance on Romania. On 3 September, the first troops of the Central Powers marched into Romanian territory. Simultaneously, the Bulgarian Air Force commenced an incessant bombing of Bucharest. In an attempt to relieve some pressure, French and British forces launched a new offensive known as the Battle of the Somme, while the Brusilov offensive continued in the East. It is certain that so relatively small a state as Rumania had never before been given a role so important, and, indeed, so decisive for the history of the world at so favorable a moment. Never before had two Great Powers like Germany and Austria found themselves so much at the mercy of the military resources of a country which had scarcely one twentieth of the population of the two great states. Judging by the military situation, it was to be expected that Rumania had only to advance where she wished to decide the world war in favor of those Powers which had been hurling themselves at us in vain for years. Thus everything seemed to depend on whether Rumania was ready to make any sort of use of her momentary advantage. The entrance of Romania into the war was disconcerting for von Hindenburg. On 15 September, Paul von Hindenburg issued the following order, stating that: \"The main task of the Armies is now to hold fast all positions on the Western, Eastern, Italian and Macedonian Fronts, and to employ all other available forces against Rumania.\" Fortunately for the Central Powers, the quantity and quality of the Romanian Army was overestimated. Although numbering half a million men, the Romanian Army suffered from poor training and a lack of appropriate equipment. The initial success of the Romanian Army in Austria-Hungarian territory was quickly undermined by the Central Powers. German and Austro-Hungarian troops advanced from the north, while Bulgarian-Turkish-German forces marched into Romania from the south. Although thought to be a tactical blunder by contemporaries, the Romanians opted to mount operations in both directions. By the middle of November the German force passed through the Carpathians, suffering significant casualties due to determined Romanian resistance. By 5 December, Bulgarian troops had crossed the Danube and were approaching the capital, Bucharest. At the same time as the Austro-Hungarian troops moved east, and as the Bulgarians marched north, the Turks had sent in two army divisions by sea to the Dobruja from the east. Eventually, the Romanian forces were pushed back behind the Siret in northern Moldavia. They received help from the Allies, notably from France which sent a military mission of more than a thousand officers, health and support staff. The Act of 5 November 1916 was proclaimed then to the Poles jointly by the Emperors Wilhelm II of Germany and Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary. This act promised the creation of the Kingdom of Poland out of territory of Congress Poland, envisioned by its authors as a puppet state controlled by the Central Powers. The origin of that document was the dire need to draft new recruits from German-occupied Poland for the war with Russia. Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918 ending the World War I, in spite of the previous initial total dependence of the kingdom on its sponsors, it ultimately served against their intentions as the cornerstone proto state of the nascent Second Polish Republic, the latter conposed also of territories never intended by the Central Powers to be c\n\nquestion: How long was the Eastern Front compared to the Western Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1135}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

By January 1917, the ranks of the Romanian army had been significantly thinned. Roughly 150,000 Romanian soldiers had been taken prisoner, 200,000 men were dead or wounded, and lost two thirds of their country, including the capital. Importantly, the Ploie\u0219ti oilfields, the only significant source of oil in Europe west of the Black Sea, had been destroyed before they were abandoned to the Central Powers. The Russian February Revolution aimed to topple the Russian monarchy and resulted in the creation of the Provisional Government. The revolution was a turning point in Russian history, and its significance and influence can still be felt in many countries today. Although many Russians wanted a revolution, no one had expected it to happen when it did \u2013 let alone how it did. On International Women's Day, Thursday, 23 February 1917/8 March 1917, as many as 90,000 female workers in the city of Petrograd left their factory jobs and marched through the streets, shouting \"Bread\", \"Down with the autocracy!\" and \"Stop the War!\" These women were tired, hungry, and angry, after working long hours in miserable conditions to feed their families because their menfolk were fighting at the front. They were not alone in demanding change; more than 150,000 men and women took to the streets to protest the next day. By Saturday, 25 February, the city of Petrograd was essentially shut down. No one was allowed to work or wanted to work. Even though there were a few incidents of police and soldiers firing into the crowds, those groups soon mutinied and joined the protesters. Tsar Nicholas II, who was not in Petrograd during the revolution, heard reports of the protests but chose not to take them seriously. By 1 March, it was obvious to everyone except the Tsar himself, that his rule was over. On 2 March it was made official. From this point onwards Russia was administered by the Russian Provisional Government until the October Revolution. In early July 1917, on a relatively small area of the Romanian front, there began one of the largest concentrations of combat forces and means known during the conflagration: nine armies, 80 infantry divisions with 974 battalions, 19 cavalry divisions with 550 squadrons and 923 artillery batteries; in total they numbered some 800,000 men, with about one million in their immediate reserve. Between late July and early September, the Romanian Army fought the battles of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti, M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti and Oituz, managing to stop the German-Austro-Hungarian advance, inflicting heavy losses in the process and winning the most important Allied victories on the Eastern Front in 1917. As a result of these operations, the remaining Romanian territories remained unoccupied, tying down nearly 1,000,000 Central Powers troops and prompting The Times to describe the Romanian front as \"The only point of light in the East\". On 29 June 1917, Alexander Kerensky, the Minister of War in the Russian Provisional Government, launched the Kerensky offensive to end Austria-Hungary once and for all. The Russians made only 6 miles (9.7 km) of progress but the Austrians counterattacked and drove them almost entirely out of Austria-Hungary, and they retreated 150 miles (240 km), losing Tarnopol, Stanislau and Czernowitz. This defeat was accompanied by 60,000 casualties and contributed greatly to the collapse of the Russian Army during the October Revolution. Although the February Revolution had overthrown the Tsar, the Bolsheviks still were not satisfied. In their view, the new Provisional Government was merely a more deceptive continuation of the previous government; they still refused to withdraw from the war despite how badly it was going. The upper class still wielded considerable influence in Russian economics and politics, so by September 1917, Lenin began advocating for a second revolution - one that would allow the workers and peasants to gain total control over the country.  The Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party convened on 10 October, and after much heated debate, agreed that it was time to begin planning for an armed insurrection. Troops who were loyal to the Bolsheviks took control of the telegraph stations, power stations, strategic bridges, post offices, train stations, and state banks. Petrograd was officially in the hands of the Bolsheviks, who greatly increased their organization in factory groups and in many barracks throughout Petrograd. They concentrated on devising a plan for overturning the Provisional Government, with a coup d'\u00e9tat. On 24 October, Lenin emerged from hiding in a suburb, entered the city, set up his headquarters at the Smolny Institute and worked to complete his three-phase plan. With the main bridges and the main railways secured, only the Winter Palace, and with it the Provisional Government, remained to be taken. On the evening of 7 November, the troops that were loyal to the Bolsheviks infiltrated the Winter Palace.

Lenin announced that the new Bolshevik government would immediately be seeking an end to the war, implementing a system of worker\u2019s democracy, and establishing collective ownership of all farms and factories. Lenin's new Bolshevik government tried to end the war, with a ceasefire being declared on 15 December 1917 along lines agreed in November. At the same time, the Bolsheviks launched a full-scale military offensive against its opponents: Ukraine and separatist governments in the Don region. During the peace negotiations between the Soviets and the Central Powers, the Germans demanded enormous concessions, eventually resulting in the failure of the long-drawn-out peace negotiations on 17 February 1918. At the same time, the Central Powers concluded a military treaty with Ukraine which was losing ground in the fight with invading Bolshevik forces.  The Russian Civil War, which started just after November 1917, would tear apart Russia for three years. As a result of the events in 1917, many groups opposed to Lenin's Bolsheviks had formed. With the fall of Nicholas II, many parts of the Russian Empire took the opportunity to declare their independence, one of which was Finland, which did so in December 1917; however, Finland too collapsed into a civil war. Finland declared itself independent on 6 December 1917, and this was accepted by Lenin a month later. The Finnish Parliament elected a German prince as King of Finland. However, the Socialists (The Reds) and the Whites in Finland fell into war with each other in January 1918. The Reds wanted Finland to be a Soviet republic and were aided by Russian forces still in Finland. The Whites of Finland were led by General C.G.E.Mannerheim, a Finnish baron who had been in the Tsar's service since he was 15 years old. The Whites were also offered help by a German Expeditionary Corps led by German General Goltz. Though Mannerheim never accepted the offer, the German corps landed in Finland in April 1918. After the disintegration of the Russian imperial army and navy in 1917, the Council of People's Commissars headed by Leon Trotsky set about creating a new army. By a decree on 28 January 1918, the council created the Workers' and Peoples' Red Army; it began recruitment on a voluntary basis, but on 22 April, the Soviet government made serving in the army compulsory for anyone who did not employ hired labor. Several officers who had served in the Russian Imperial Army defected to the Red Army in support of the Bolshevik cause. Many of them were of an aristocratic background but became disillusioned with imperialism and monarchism, although the Red Army still mostly consisted of ordinary workers and peasants.  With the German Army just 85 miles (137 km) from the Russian capital Petrograd (St. Petersburg) on 3 March 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed and the Eastern Front ceased to be a war zone. While the treaty was practically obsolete before the end of the year, it did provide some relief to the Bolsheviks, who were embroiled in a civil war, and affirmed the independence of Ukraine. However, Estonia and Latvia were intended to become a United Baltic Duchy to be ruled by German princes and German nobility as fiefdoms under the German Kaiser. A rump Polish state was also foreseen on the formerly Russian territories. Finland's sovereignty had already been declared in December 1917, and accepted by most nations, including France and Russia, but not by the United Kingdom and the United States. On 7 May 1918 Romania signed the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central Powers, which recognised Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia in return for ceding control of passes in the Carpathian Mountains to Austria-Hungary and granting oil concessions to Germany. Although approved by Parliament, Ferdinand I refused to sign the treaty, hoping for an Allied victory; Romania re-entered the war on 10 November 1918 on the side of the Allies and the Treaty of Bucharest was formally annulled by the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Between 1914 and 1918, an estimated 400,000 to 600,000 ethnic Romanians served with the Austro-Hungarian army, of whom up to 150,000 were killed in action; total military and civilian deaths within contemporary Romanian borders are estimated at 748,000. The Germans were able to repair the oil fields around Ploie\u0219ti and by the end of the war had pumped a million tons of oil. They also requisitioned two million tons of grain from Romanian farmers. These materials were vital in keeping Germany in the war to the end of 1918. With the end of major combat on the Eastern Front, the Germans were able to transfer substantial forces to the west in order to mount an offensive in France in the spring of 1918. This offensive on the Western Front failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough, and the arrival of more and more American units in Europe was sufficient to offset the German advantage. Even after the Russian collapse, about a million German soldiers remained tied up in the east until\n\nquestion: How long was the Eastern Front compared to the Western Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1155}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the end, the Central Powers had to relinquish all of their captured lands on the eastern front, with Germany even being forced to cede territory they held before the war, under various treaties (such as the Treaty of Versailles) signed after the armistice in 1918. Although the Allied Powers' victory led to the Central Powers being forced to cancel the treaty signed with Russia, the victors were at the time intervening in the Russian Civil War, causing bad relations between Russia and the Allied Powers. In comparison to the attention directed to the role played by women on the Western Front during the First World War, the role of women in the east has garnered limited scholarly focus. It is estimated that 20 percent of the Russian industrial working class was conscripted into the army; therefore, women's share of industrial jobs increased dramatically. There were percentage increases in every industry, but the most noticeable increase happened in industrial labour, which increased from 31.4 percent in 1913 to 45 percent in 1918. Women also fought on the Eastern Front. In the later stages of Russia's participation in the war, Russia began forming all-woman combat units, the Women's Battalions, in part to fight plummeting morale among male soldiers by demonstrating Russian women's willingness to fight. In Romania, Ecaterina Teodoroiu actively fought in the Romanian Army and is remembered today as a national hero. British nursing efforts were not limited to the Western Front. Nicknamed the \"Gray partridges\" in reference to their dark gray overcoats, Scottish volunteer nurses arrived in Romania in 1916 under the leadership of Elsie Inglis. In addition to nursing injured personnel, Scottish nurses manned transport vehicles and acted as regimental cooks. The \"Gray Partridges\" were well respected by Romanian, Serbian and Russian troops and as a result, the Romanian press went as far as to characterize them as \"healthy, masculine, and tanned women.\" As a testament to her abilities, Elsie Inglis and her volunteers were entrusted to turn an abandoned building in the city of Gala\u021bi into an operational hospital, which they did in a little more than a day. Yvonne Fitzroy's published journal, \"With the Scottish Nurses in Roumania,\" provides an excellent first hand account of Scottish nursing activities in the Eastern Front. During World War I, approximately 200,000 German soldiers and 2.5 million soldiers from the Austro-Hungarian army entered Russian captivity. During the 1914 Russian campaign the Russians began taking thousands of Austrian prisoners. As a result, the Russian authorities made emergency facilities in Kiev, Penza, Kazan, and later Turkestan to hold the Austrian prisoners of war. As the war continued Russia began to detain soldiers from Germany as well as a growing number from the Austro-Hungarian army. The Tsarist state saw the large population of POWs as a workforce that could benefit the war economy in Russia. Many POWs were employed as farm laborers and miners in Donbas and Krivoi Rog. However, the majority of POWs were employed as laborers constructing canals and building railroads. The living and working environments for these POWs was bleak. There was a shortage of food, clean drinking water and proper medical care. During the summer months malaria was a major problem, and the malnutrition among the POWs led to many cases of scurvy. While working on the Murmansk rail building project over 25,000 POWs died. Information about the bleak conditions of the labor camps reached the German and Austro-Hungarian governments. They began to complain about the treatment of POWs. The Tsarist authorities initially refused to acknowledge the German and Habsburg governments. They rejected their claims because Russian POWs were working on railway construction in Serbia. However, they slowly agreed to stop using prison labor. Life in the camps was extremely rough for the men who resided in them. The Tsarist government could not provide adequate supplies for the men living in their POW camps. The Russian government's inability to supply the POWs in their camps with supplies was due to inadequate resources and bureaucratic rivalries. However, the conditions in the POW camps varied; some were more bearable than others. Disease played a critical role in the loss of life on the Eastern Front. In the East, disease accounted for approximately four times the number of deaths caused by direct combat, in contrast to the three to one ratio in the West. Malaria, cholera, and dysentery contributed to the epidemiological crisis on the Eastern Front; however, typhus fever, transmitted by pathogenic lice and previously unknown to German medical officers before the outbreak of the war, was the most deadly. There was a direct correlation between the environmental conditions of the East and the prevalence of disease. With cities excessively crowded by refugees fleeing their native countries, unsanitary medical conditions created a suitable environment for diseases to spread. Primitive hygienic conditions\n\nquestion: How long was the Eastern Front compared to the Western Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1126}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Ultimately, a large scale sanitation program was put into effect. This program, named Sanitit\u00e4tswesen (Medical Affairs), was responsible for ensuring proper hygienic procedures were being carried out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Quarantine centers were built, and diseased neighbourhoods were isolated from the rest of the population. Delousing stations were prevalent in the countryside and in cities to prevent the spread of typhus fever, with mass numbers of natives being forced to take part in this process at military bathhouses. A \"sanitary police\" was also introduced to confirm the cleanliness of homes, and any home deemed unfit would be boarded up with a warning sign. Dogs and cats were also killed for fear of possible infection. To avoid the spread of disease, prostitution became regulated. Prostitutes were required to register for a permit, and authorities demanded mandatory medical examinations for all prostitutes, estimating that seventy percent of prostitutes carried a venereal disease. Military brothels were introduced to combat disease; the city of Kowno emphasized proper educational use of contraceptives such as condoms, encouraged proper cleansing of the genital area after intercourse, and gave instructions on treatment in the case of infection. The Russian casualties in the First World War are difficult to estimate, due to the poor quality of available statistics. Cornish gives a total of 2,006,000 military dead (700,000 killed in action, 970,000 died of wounds, 155,000 died of disease and 181,000 died while POWs). This measure of Russian losses is similar to that of the British Empire, 5% of the male population in the 15 to 49 age group. He says civilian casualties were five to six hundred thousand in the first two years, and were then not kept, so a total of over 1,500,000 is not unlikely. He has over five million men passing into captivity, the majority during 1915. When Russia withdrew from the war, 2,500,000 Russian POWs were in German and Austrian hands. This by far exceeded the total number of prisoners of war (1,880,000) lost by the armies of Britain, France and Germany combined. Only the Austro-Hungarian Army, with 2,200,000 POWs, came even close. The empire of Austria lost approximately 60% of its territory as a result of the war, and evolved into a smaller state with a small homogeneous population of 6.5 million people. With the loss, Vienna was now an imperial capital without an empire to support it. The states that were formed around Austria feared the return of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and put measures into place to prevent it from re-forming. Czechoslovakia was created through the merging of the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, previously under Austrian rule, united with Slovakia and Ruthenia, which were part of Hungary. Although these groups had many differences between them, they believed that together they would create a stronger state. The new country was a multi-ethnic state. The population consisted of Czechs (51%), Slovaks (16%), Germans (22%), Hungarians (5%) and Rusyns (4%), with other ethnic groups making up 2%. Many of the Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians and Poles and some Slovaks, felt oppressed because the political elite did not generally allow political autonomy for minority ethnic groups. The state proclaimed the official ideology that there are no Czechs and Slovaks, but only one nation of Czechoslovaks (see Czechoslovakism), to the disagreement of Slovaks and other ethnic groups. Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II the conflict between the Czechs and the Slovaks surfaced again. After the war Hungary was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources. The loss of territory was similar to that of Austria after the breaking up the Austria-Hungary territory. They lost the territories of Transylvania, Slovakia, Croatia, Slavonia, Syrmia, and Banat. Italy incorporated the regions of Trieste and South Tyrol from Austria. The creation of a free and Independent Poland was one of Wilson's fourteen points. At the end of the 18th century the state of Poland was broken apart by Prussia, Russia, and Austria. During the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, the Commission on Polish Affairs was created which recommended there be a passageway across West Prussia and Posen, in order to give Poland access to the Baltic through the port of Danzig at the mouth of the Vistula River. The creation of the state of Poland would separate East Prussia from the rest of Germany, as it was before the Partitions of Poland. Poland also received Upper Silesia.

The state of Romania was enlarged greatly after the war. As a result of the Paris peace conference Romania kept the Dobrudja and Transylvania. Between the states of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania an alliance named the Little Entente was formed. They worked together on matters of foreign policy in order to prevent a Habsburg restoration. Initially Yugoslavia began as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. The State secured its territory at the Paris peace talks after the end of the war. The state suffered from many internal problems because of the many diverse cultures and languages within the state. Yugoslavia was divided on national, linguistic, economic, and religious lines.\n\nquestion: How long was the Eastern Front compared to the Western Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 236}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The Eastern Front of the First World War was roughly delimited by the Baltic Sea in the west; Minsk in the east; Saint Petersburg in the north; and the Black Sea in the south; a distance of more than 1,600 kilometers. The entire frontier had the Russian Empire and Romania on one side; and the Central Powers on the other. The Eastern Front saw the Central Powers defeating the Russian Empire in several major battles. This ultimately led to Russian withdrawal from WW1 through the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Here are the major battles and events of World War I on the Eastern Front including their dates, places and nations involved. Date: August 17, 1914 The Russian military was the largest in the world consisting of 1.4 million men prior to the war. Contrary to their enemy\u2019s expectations, the Russians were able to mobilize enough men within 2 weeks. Two Russian armies were sent to East Prussia in Germany, and four armies were sent to invade the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia. Date: August 23 to September 11, 1914, aka Battle of Lemberg By August 23, 1914, Austro-Hungarian 1st, 3rd and 4th Armies were concentrated in Galicia with the aim of invading Russian Poland. They now faced the Russian 3rd, 4th, 5th and 8th Armies in the major Battle of Galicia. The Austro-Hungarian armies were severely defeated and forced out of Galicia, while the Russians captured Lemberg. As the Austrians retreated, many Slavic soldiers in the Austro-Hungarian Army surrendered and some even offered to fight for the Russians. The Austro Hungarian casualties numbered in excess of 400,000 while that of the Russians were at 225,000. Date: August 26 \u2013 30, 1914 The German Eighth Army launched a surprise attack on the invading Russian 2nd Army and won a decisive battle near Tannenberg. The Russian 1st Army was also routed in subsequent engagements and there were 170,000 Russian casualties with minimal loss to the Germans. Date: September 7 \u2013 14, 1914 In a German offensive, General Paul von Rennenkampf\u2019s Russian First Army was pushed back and eventually out of German territory by the General Hindenburg\u2019s German Eighth Army. A German advance was however halted by the arrival of the Russian Tenth Army. Date: September 16, 1914 \u2013 March 22, 1915 As the Austro-Hungarian forces fell back over 160 kilometers to the Carpathian Mountains after the Battle of Galicia, the fortress of Przemy\u015bl was the only Austrian post to hold out. The Siege of Przemy\u015bl, the longest siege of the First World War, ended in a complete Russian victory a few months later. Date: October 29, 1914 The Ottomans, with the help of the Germans, carried a naval sortie in the Black Sea ports of Russia. The attack was conceived by Ottoman War Minister Enver Pasha and led to the entry of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. They would officially declare war on the 11th of November. Date: February 7 \u2013 22, 1915 The German Eighth and Tenth Armies launched a winter offensive with the intent of advancing beyond the Vistula River. The battle ended in a German victory giving them a toehold in Russian territory. However, the Russian Tenth Army was able to halt any further advance. In the following weeks, the Germans drove the Russians out of their remaining small enclaves in East Prussia. Date: May 2 \u2013 June 22, 1915 The Austro-Hungarians had faced considerable reverses since the beginning of the war. Due to this, they looked for German support on the Eastern Front. A joint offensive under General August von Mackensen was thus planned and launched in the Gorlice Tarnow area, southeast of Krakow. Initially conceived as a minor effort to relieve pressure on the Austro Hungarians, the offensive was a striking success for the Central Forces, who were able to decisively defeat the Russian III Army, recapture Galicia along with Przemy\u015bl and advance for miles within Russian territory. Date: July \u2013 September 1915 Suffering heavy casualties and loss of military equipment, the Imperial Russian Army was ordered to retreat from the Galicia Poland salient by the Russian Stavka, the high command of the armed forces in the Russian Empire. A strategic retreat was therefore conducted to shorten the front lines and avoid the potential encirclement of large Russian forces in the salient. The German advance was halted by Russian counterattacks in late September, and a new frontline was established from the Baltic Sea through Belarusian forests to the Romanian border.

The operation was a total failure for the Russians. Date: June 4 \u2013 September 20, 1916 The southwestern front of the Imperial Russian Army under General Aleksei Brusilov, launched one of their most successful, and the most lethal offensive in World War I. Four Russian armies were round up and the attack began on 4th June with a massive artillery barrage on Austro Hungarian lines. The offensive would end in September when the Russian resources began running out. The Austro Hungarians had by now lost close to 1,000,000 men as casualties and 25,000 sq. km of territory. Due to this, Germany had to aid its ally and send divisions from the Western Front. This, in turn, would ruin German plans on the Western Front. Date: February 18 \u2013 March 3, 1918 The last major action on the Eastern Front began with Operation Faustschlag (\u201cOperation Fist Punch\u201d). This offensive by the Central Powers saw little Russian resistance due to the turmoil of the Russian Revolution and the subsequent Russian Civil War. Huge territories were captured in the Baltics, Belarus and Ukraine, forcing the Bolshevik government of Russia to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which officially ended Russian participation in the First World War.

Our editors will review what you\u2019ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. The Eastern Front was a major theatre of combat during World War I that included operations on the main Russian front as well as campaigns in Romania. The main front was divided into three \u201csub-theatres\u201d\u2014with campaigns in the German province of East Prussia in the north, Austrian Galicia in the south, and the Russian-held Polish salient in between\u2014each of which had its own unique characteristics. The Eastern Front stretched across eastern Europe from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south. This was a span of some 800 miles (roughly 1,300 km) in a direct line\u2014or more than twice that distance if measured along the borders between the opposing countries. On the Eastern Front, Germany and other members of the Central Powers, such as Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, fought against Russia and Romania of the Allied and Associated Powers. While much of the fighting on the Western Front was characterized by trench warfare and stalemates, fighting on the Eastern Front was more conventional, involving fluid movements of armies in massive offensives and counteroffensives. Fighting on the Eastern Front ended on March 3, 1918, when a peace treaty between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers was signed at Brest-Litovsk. To understand why the treaty was signed, one must go back to early 1917. Military defeats and economic instability had shaken the Russian Empire and led to the fall, in February 1917, of Tsar Nicholas II\u2019s government. This government was replaced by a short-lived Provisional Government. On October 24\u201325 (November 6\u20137, New Style) Vladimir Lenin\u2019s Bolsheviks and their Left Socialist Revolutionary allies staged a coup d'\u00e9tat, later called the Bolshevik Revolution. One day after taking power, Lenin published two decrees that dissolved the Eastern Front overnight, increased chaos in Russia, and made very difficult any organized resistance to communist rule. His Land Decree, which abolished landed estates without compensation to their owners, drew Russian soldiers away from the front line and back to their home villages. His Peace Decree offered the peoples of all the belligerent states peace negotiations on the basis that there should be no annexations and no indemnities and that the right of self-determination should be recognized for all. On November 26, 1917, the Soviet of People\u2019s Commissars, as the new communist government was called, unilaterally ordered the cessation of hostilities on Russia\u2019s European and Transcaucasian fronts. Russia\u2019s armistice with the Central Powers was signed on December 15, 1917. Subsequently, however, Germany pushed for Russia to accept the Central Powers\u2019 peace terms by launching its armies into the newly constituted Ukrainian National Republic, across the armistice lines in Belorussia and Latvia, and even into Estonia. This forced Lenin\u2019s hand, and the peace treaty was signed on March 3, 1918. As a result, Russia recognized both Finland and Ukraine as independent; renounced control over Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and most of Belorussia; and ceded Kars, Ardahan, and Batumi in Transcaucasia to the Ottoman Empire. Eastern Front, major theatre of combat during World War I that included operations on the main Russian front as well as campaigns in Romania. The principal belligerents were Russia and Romania (of the Allied and Associated Powers) versus the Central Powers countries of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria. The Eastern Front, which stretched from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south, was more than twice as long as the Western Front. The greater distances and greater differences between the equipment and quality of the armies involved ensured a fluidity of combat which was lacking in the west. In August 1914 the Russian and Austro-Hungarian\u2013German armies faced each other across a frontier that stretched over 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from the Baltic Sea to the northern border of Romania, which was at that time neutral. This great length was due to the projection of Russian Poland as a huge salient between German East Prussia and Austrian Galicia. After Romania joined in the war on the side of the Allies in 1916, the front extended from the Baltic to the Black Sea, a span of some 800 miles (roughly 1,300 km) in a direct line, or more than twice that distance if measured along the borders between the opposing countries. The shape of the frontier, the great distances, and the physical features and nature of the communications combined to divide the Eastern Front into three \u201csub-theatres\u201d until the Russian retreat out of Poland in 1915. Thus, the operations in East Prussia, in the Polish salient, and in Galicia, though they formed part of a combined whole, each had their own special characteristics.

The only heights sufficient to constitute a serious military obstacle were the Carpathians, which extended in a semicircle from the southwest corner of the Polish salient to the Iron Gate on the Danube, forming a protective barrier for the Hungarian plains on the north and east. Opposite Russia they ran roughly parallel to the frontier, some 50\u2013100 miles (80\u2013160 km) from it; opposite Romania the Carpathians actually marked the frontier. It was a constant aim of the Russians throughout their operations, as well as the objective of Romania\u2019s single abortive offensive, to pierce this barrier and reach the plains below. Although the Eastern Front had but a single notable mountain barrier, the water obstacles in the theatre were numerous and formidable. The most significant from a strategic standpoint was the Pripet Marshes, a vast waterlogged wetland covering approximately 104,000 square miles (270,000 square km), where infrastructure was undeveloped and military movements on a large scale were extremely difficult in consequence. Other water lines which had a considerable effect on operations were: in East Prussia, the line of the Masurian lakes; in the Polish salient, the rivers Vistula, Narew, Bobr, Niemen, and Bug; in Galicia, the Dunajec, Wis\u0142ok, San, and Dniester; and in the Romanian theatre, the Danube itself, the Olt, and the Siret. Besides the rivers enumerated above, there were a number of lesser streams which influenced the course and direction of the operations. Strategy in this theatre was in fact largely determined by rivers. Rivers slow the movement of an advancing army but are seldom a permanent bar to its progress. Although many of the principal river crossings had been fortified in peace, these fortifications had little influence on the course of operations\u2014except, notably, at Przemy\u015bl. In East Prussia and in Poland were extensive stretches of forest, which had certain tactical consequences. The Carpathians also were thickly wooded. The real key to strategy on this eastern European front lay in the communications and logistics systems. In this respect the contrast between Russia and its western neighbours was striking. The transportation system in Russia was extremely underdeveloped, in spite of all efforts in the years preceding the war to develop strategic railways. The Russian general staff had prevented road or railway construction in the north and in the southeast of the Polish salient in order to provide protection to a defensive position in the centre of the salient. This shortsighted policy seriously hampered Russian strategy when an offensive campaign from Poland was undertaken. Nor could Russia make much use of its great rivers as lines of supply, owing to lack of previous development. Thus, superior command and communications infrastructure gave Russia\u2019s adversaries the inestimable advantage of greater mobility. The armies that met on the Eastern Front were all conscript forces. Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Germany required three to four years of service from able-bodied males of military age, to be followed by several years in reserve formations. Military strength was counted in terms of divisions (12,000\u201320,000 officers and men), the smallest military units capable of independent action. In August 1914 the Russian army consisted of 102 regular divisions divided into six field armies, boasting a total manpower of some 1.4 million. Germany\u2019s eight field armies consisted of 98 regular divisions, supplemented by 27 Landwehr (reserve) brigades, for a total strength of 1.9 million men; although this force was significantly larger than Russia\u2019s army, it would have to be deployed on two fronts. Austria-Hungary\u2019s six field armies were divided into 48 divisions, with a total manpower of some 450,000. Of the Germans little else need be said; their army of 1914 was among the most powerful instruments of war the world had yet seen. The raw material of the Russian army was in many ways excellent. The typical Russian infantryman was noted for his discipline and bravery, but he often lacked leadership, as the army did not possess a deep well of officers and senior enlisted men from which to draw. Once the original cadre of regular officers and noncommissioned officers had fallen, there were few candidates to replace them, because the Russian system did not produce reserve officers with great efficiency. The Russian army was very weak on the technical side; it was lacking in artillery, and it fielded large masses of cavalry, provision for which threw a great strain on the communications and logistics systems, but which accomplished little. In no way\u2014except by weight of numbers\u2014could a Russian army hope to gain the advantage over a German force. The Austro-Hungarian army, only slightly, if at all, superior to the Russian on the technical side, was inferior to it in fighting quality. This was in large part due to a senior officer corps that was mediocre at best. Austro-Hungarian troops\n\nquestion: Who were the main countries involved in the Eastern Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Germany", "usage": 1120}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A Russian force was almost always the master of an Austro-Hungarian force of similar size, but it required a great numerical preponderance to meet a force of Germans with any hope of success. The high state of discipline, training, leadership, and armament of the German army reduced the significance of the initial numerical inferiority of the armies of the Central Powers. Due to the comparative slowness of mobilization, poor higher leadership, and lower scale of armament of the Russian armies, there was an approximate balance of forces in August 1914 which prevented one side from gaining a quick victory. The Russian military expert Gen. Nikolai N. Golovin rated one German division as the equivalent of one and a half Russian divisions. Germany and Austria-Hungary also enjoyed the advantage of interior lines of communication which enabled them to send their forces to critical points on the battlefronts by the shortest route. According to Gen. Wilhelm Groener, Germany\u2019s railway network made it possible to move eight divisions simultaneously from the Western Front to the Eastern Front in four and a half days. Even greater in importance was the advantage that Germany derived from military traditions and a system of command dating back to the reforms of Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst, Count Neidhardt von Gneisenau, Count von Roon, and the elder Helmuth von Moltke. Skilled in directing a war of movement and quick to exploit the advantages of flank attacks, German senior officers, with the exception of Moltke\u2019s namesake nephew, were capable of successfully directing the operations of large formations. The German plan of 1914 was a modification of one drawn up by Alfred von Schlieffen many years previously. It provided for an offensive against France designed to obtain a rapid and decisive victory and a defensive in the east against Russia until the decision had been obtained in the west. The choice of France for the initial offensive was actuated chiefly by the relative slowness of Russian mobilization and by the impossibility of gaining a rapid decision against Russia owing to the great distances. Germany\u2019s problem in the east was then to determine the minimum strength to be left for defensive purposes. This was eventually fixed at nine divisions, active and reserve, with one cavalry division, for the protection of East Prussia. Certain second-line troops were tasked with the defense of the Eastern Front fortresses such as Posen (now Pozna\u0144, Poland), Thorn (now Toru\u0144, Poland), Danzig (now Gda\u0144sk, Poland), and Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) and to watch the Polish frontier. The troops in East Prussia, organized into four corps, formed the Eighth Army under Max von Prittwitz. The chief of the Austro-Hungarian general staff, Franz, Graf Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, had planned an offensive into southeast Poland between the Vistula and Bug rivers, directed at Che\u0142m and Lublin. This was to be carried out by the First and Fourth armies (under Gen. Viktor Dankl and Gen. Moritz von Auffenberg, respectively). To protect their right flank and rear, the Second and Third armies (under Gen. Hermann K\u00f6vess and Gen. Rudolf von Brudermann) deployed east of Halicz and Lemberg. Conrad\u2019s offensive was originally designed as part of a combined Austro-Hungarian\u2013German offensive, in which German forces from East Prussia were simultaneously to attack along the Narew River. German and Austro-Hungarian forces were to meet about Siedlce and thus cut off the whole Polish salient. Conrad had repeatedly urged this plan on Moltke but had failed to induce him to provide sufficient troops to take the offensive from East Prussia, before France had been disposed of. In the absence of German cooperation, it is difficult to see what permanent success Conrad could have hoped for from the proposed Che\u0142m-Lublin offensive, because, as already pointed out, the Russians had neglected the infrastructure in that area expressly to frustrate the operation he had chosen. From the German point of view, however, this Austro-Hungarian offensive fitted in admirably with their strategic plan, because, whatever its outcome, it would keep the Russians fully engaged and thus safeguard the vital industrial areas of Silesia, until the campaign against France had been won. The Russians had accurately gauged the intentions of both their adversaries. Their original plan was to take the offensive against the Austro-Hungarian armies in Galicia and to act defensively in the Polish salient and against the Germans in East Prussia. They were, however, pledged to their French allies to assume the offensive against Germany at the earliest possible date. Six armies were initially deployed along the front line. The First (or Vilna) Army under Gen. Paul von Rennenkampf assembled on the eastern frontier of East Prussia, and\n\nquestion: Who were the main countries involved in the Eastern Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary", "usage": 1109}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

These two armies formed the Northwestern Front, under Gen. Yakov Grigoryevich Zhilinsky. They were intended for action against the German forces in East Prussia. The Southwestern Front, under Gen. Nikolai Ivanov, consisted of four armies, of which the Fourth (under Gen. Anton Salza) and Fifth (under Gen. Paul von Plehwe) were to deploy on the Lublin-Che\u0142m railway to meet the expected Austro-Hungarian offensive; the Third Army (Gen. Nikolai Ruzski) and Eighth Army (Gen. Aleksey Brusilov) were to take the offensive at once from the eastern frontier of Galicia in the direction of Lemberg (now Lviv, Ukraine). The Austro-Hungarian and Russian plans were almost the exact counterpart of each other. Grand Duke Nicholas assumed chief command of the Russian armies as a whole. Though no great strategist, he was shrewd and had a strong personality. His chief of staff, Gen. Nikolai Yanushkevich, was a man of no significant military ability who owed his position to his charisma at court. The Russian war plan was attributed mainly to Gen. Yuri Danilov, head of the operations branch of the general staff. In addition to the front line armies, the Sixth Army was assembled at Petrograd for the protection of the capital and as a general reserve, the Seventh Army at Odessa to guard the Black Sea coast, and an army in the Caucasus to watch Turkey. At the last moment, after mobilization, a momentous change in the Russian dispositions was made. The First and Second armies were ordered to invade East Prussia at once, without waiting to complete their concentration. This change was made solely to assist Russia\u2019s allies in the west. Rennenkampf\u2019s First Army comprised six and a half infantry divisions and five cavalry divisions, and Samsonov\u2019s Second Army was made up of 10 infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions. They had thus in combination an overwhelming superiority over Gen. Max von Prittwitz\u2019s Eighth Army, which was defending East Prussia. Coordination between them was, however, completely lacking and led to their defeat in detail. Zhilinsky, who was responsible for combining the action of the two armies, was a man of some administrative capacity but little aptitude for command. Samsonov\u2019s army had to move before its concentration was completed and was deficient in transport. The arrangements for obtaining and recording intelligence were indifferent in spite of the large masses of cavalry available. So defective were the means of communication that the Russians were frequently forced to issue \u201cin clear\u201d (unencrypted) orders by wireless, with the result that the Germans often had complete information of their enemy\u2019s moves and intentions. With the German declaration of war against Russia on August 1, 1914, all hope had been lost of the conflict between Serbia and Austria-Hungary remaining a localized affair. Armies were already mobilizing along what would become the Eastern Front. Rennenkampf crossed the frontier on August 17, driving back a German force at Stallup\u00f6nen (now Nesterov, Russia). After a hard battle at Gumbinnen (August 19\u201320), Rennenkampf defeated Prittwitz, who had concentrated against him the bulk of his army, leaving only one corps to observe the southern frontier. Meanwhile, Samsonov, moving slowly forward by M\u0142awa, crossed into East Prussia on August 21, causing Prittwitz, in momentary panic, to announce his intention of withdrawing behind the Vistula. Prittwitz was promptly replaced by Paul von Hindenburg, with Erich Ludendorff as chief of staff. Within a week Ludendorff had completely defeated the Second Army at the Battle of Tannenberg (August 26\u201330, 1914), surrounding and capturing the greater portion of it. Receiving a reinforcement of two corps which had been hastily recalled from France, Ludendorff then turned on Rennenkampf, who had remained inactive during the disaster at Tannenberg. From September 1 to September 15 Rennenkampf was attacked and driven out of East Prussia with very heavy casualties at the Battle of Masurian Lakes. In these operations the Russians had suffered a total loss of some 250,000 men, crippling in spite of Russia\u2019s immense reserves. Much war mat\u00e9riel had also been lost, and this could not easily be replaced. On the other hand, this invasion of East Prussia, by causing the recall of two corps from the west at the moment of France\u2019s crisis, had made possible the victory at the Marne. Meanwhile, in Galicia, Austria-Hungary had suffered a serious defeat at the hands of Ivanov\u2019s Southwestern army group.

However, their flank guard of the Second and Third armies was unable to withstand the onslaught of the Russian Third and Eighth armies. On September 2 Lemberg was lost, and the advance of the victorious left wing was consequently stayed. Two corps from the Russian Ninth Army (which had been formed at Warsaw as a central reserve) now reinforced Ivanov\u2019s right wing, and the whole Austro-Hungarian line was gradually pressed back. On September 11 a retirement to the San was ordered by the Austro-Hungarian command; by the end of the month they had withdrawn to within 50 miles (80 km) of Krak\u00f3w, leaving their fortress of Przemy\u015bl to withstand an extended siege. The Austro-Hungarian defeat in Galicia compelled the German Supreme Command to send direct assistance to its reeling ally. This was done by the transfer of five and a half corps, formed into the Ninth Army, from East Prussia to the Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa front. From there the Ninth Army marched on Warsaw in the last days of September in conjunction with a simultaneous advance along the whole Austro-Hungarian front up to the Carpathians. The Russians had halted on the San after the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian forces and were in the process of transferring troops north to form a new front south of Warsaw. This regrouping was carried out in safety behind the Vistula, with only cavalry being left to oppose the German advance west of the river. By the middle of October, the German Ninth Army was near Warsaw, but the Austro-Hungarian advance had been held up on the San. The Russians now counterattacked all along the line. In the south they drove the Austro-Hungarian forces back to the Dunajec River, in the centre they compelled the German Ninth Army to fall back, and in the north the newly constituted Russian Tenth Army crossed the frontiers of East Prussia. The intention of Grand Duke Nicholas, the Russian commander in chief, was now to invade Silesia with his Fifth, Fourth, and Ninth armies, in that order from the north. His right flank was to be protected by the Tenth Army in the east of East Prussia and by the First and Second armies north and west of Warsaw, his left flank by the advance of the Third and Eighth armies in Galicia. The Germans had thoroughly broken up the infrastructure in southwest Poland during their retreat, and the Russian advance was slow and halting. Their more nimble opponents once again used the superior mobility given them by their highly developed network of railways to launch a telling counterstrike. A German Eastern Front Command was constituted under Hindenburg and Ludendorff, and the German Ninth Army, now under Gen. August von Mackensen, was withdrawn from southwest Poland and concentrated between Posen and Torun. It advanced on November 11, with its left flank on the Vistula, against the right flank and rear of the Russian main armies. The Russian First and Second armies were severely mauled, and by November 17 the Second Army was in a critical situation, almost completely surrounded at \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. It was saved by a skillful intervention by Russian Gen. Paul von Plehwe\u2019s Fifth Army, and the Germans were now themselves faced with envelopment and disaster. Thanks to Rennenkampf\u2019s failure to act with due haste, however, they extricated themselves from danger. Four corps from the Western Front were released with the conclusion of the First Battle of Ypres, and these now joined Mackensen. This enabled him again to advance and to capture \u0141owicz and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a by December 12. In the south, heavy fighting had taken place east of Krak\u00f3w with no decisive result.\n\nquestion: Who were the main countries involved in the Eastern Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Austro-Hungary, Germany, and Russia.", "usage": 884}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It ranged from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south, involved most of Eastern Europe, and stretched deep into Central Europe. The term contrasts with the Western Front, which was being fought in Belgium and France. During 1910, Russian General Yuri Danilov developed \"Plan 19\" under which four armies would invade East Prussia. This plan was criticised as Austria-Hungary could be a greater threat than the German Empire. So instead of four armies invading East Prussia, the Russians planned to send two armies to East Prussia, and two armies to defend against Austro-Hungarian forces invading from Galicia. In the opening months of the war, the Imperial Russian Army attempted an invasion of eastern Prussia in the Northwestern theater, only to be beaten back by Germany after some initial success. At the same time, in the south, they successfully invaded Galicia, defeating the Austro-Hungarian forces there. In Russian Poland, the Germans failed to take Warsaw. But by 1915, the German and Austro-Hungarian forces were on the advance, dealing the Russians heavy casualties in Galicia and in Poland, forcing them to retreat. Grand Duke Nicholas was sacked from his position as the commander-in-chief and replaced by Tsar Nicholas himself. Several offensives against the Germans in 1916 failed, including the Lake Naroch Offensive and the Baranovichi Offensive. However, General Aleksei Brusilov oversaw a highly successful operation against Austria-Hungary that became known as the Brusilov offensive, which saw the Russian Army make large gains. Being the largest and most lethal offensive of World War I, the effects of the Brusilov offensive were far reaching. It helped to relieve the German pressure during the Battle of Verdun, while also helping to relieve the Austro-Hungarian pressure on the Italians. As a result, the Austro-Hungarian Armed Forces were fatally weakened, and finally Romania decided to enter the war on the side of the Allies. However, the Russian human and material losses also greatly contributed to the Russian Revolutions. Romania entered the war in August 1916. The Allied Powers promised the region of Transylvania (which was part of Austria-Hungary) in return for Romanian support. The Romanian Army invaded Transylvania and had initial successes, but was forced to stop and was pushed back by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians when Bulgaria attacked them from the south. Meanwhile, a revolution occurred in Russia in March 1917 (one of the causes being the hardships of the war). Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate and a Russian Provisional Government was founded, with Georgy Lvov as its first leader, who was eventually replaced by Alexander Kerensky. The newly formed Russian Republic continued to fight the war alongside Romania and the rest of the Entente in desultory fashion. It was overthrown by the Bolsheviks in November 1917. Following the Armistice of Foc\u0219ani between Romania and the Central Powers, Romania also signed a peace treaty with the Central Powers on 7 May 1918, however it was canceled by Romania on 10 November 1918. The new government established by the Bolsheviks signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers in March 1918, taking it out of the war; leading to a Central Powers victory on the Eastern Front and Russian defeat in World War I. The front in the east was much longer than that in the west. The theater of war was roughly delimited by the Baltic Sea in the west and Minsk in the east, and Saint Petersburg in the north and the Black Sea in the south, a distance of more than 1,600 kilometres (990 mi). This had a drastic effect on the nature of the warfare. While the war on the Western Front developed into trench warfare, the battle lines on the Eastern Front were much more fluid and trenches never truly developed. This was because the greater length of the front ensured that the density of soldiers in the line was lower so the line was easier to break. Once broken, the sparse communication networks made it difficult for the defender to rush reinforcements to the rupture in the line, mounting rapid counteroffensives to seal off any breakthrough. Propaganda was a key component of the culture of World War I. It was often shown through state-controlled media, and helped to bolster nationalism and patriotism within countries. On the Eastern Front, propaganda took many forms such as opera, film, spy fiction, theater\n\nquestion: Who were the main countries involved in the Eastern Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Russia, Romania, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire, and Germany", "usage": 1126}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Across the Eastern Front the amount of propaganda used in each country varied from state to state. Propaganda took many forms within each country and was distributed by many different groups. Most commonly the state produced propaganda, but other groups, such as anti-war organizations, also generated propaganda. Prior to the outbreak of war, German strategy was based almost entirely on the so-called Schlieffen Plan. With the Franco-Russian Agreement in place, Germany knew that war with either of these combatants would result in war with the other, which meant that there would be war in both the west and the east (two-front war). Therefore, the German General Staff, under Alfred von Schlieffen and then Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, planned a quick, all-out ground war on the Western Front to take France and, upon victory, Germany would turn its attention to Russia in the east. Schlieffen believed Russia would not be ready or willing to move against and attack Germany due to the huge losses of military equipment that Russia had suffered in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905, its low population density and lack of railroads. Conversely, the Imperial German Navy believed it could be victorious over Britain with Russian neutrality, something which Moltke knew would not be possible. In the immediate years preceding the First World War, the Kingdom of Romania was involved in the Second Balkan War on the side of Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and the Ottoman Empire against Bulgaria. The Treaty of Bucharest, signed on 10 August 1913, ended the Balkan conflict and added 6,960 square kilometers to Romania's territory. Although militarized, Romania decided upon a policy of neutrality at the start of the First World War, mainly due to having territorial interests in both Austria-Hungary (Transylvania and Bukovina) and in Russia (Bessarabia). Strong cultural influences also affected Romanian leanings, however. King Carol I, as a Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, favoured his Germanic roots, while the Romanian people, influenced by their Orthodox church and Latin-based language, were inclined to join France. Perhaps King Carol's attempts at joining the war on the side of the Central powers would have been fruitful had he not died in 1914, but Romanian disenchantment with Austria-Hungary had already influenced public and political opinion. French endorsement of Romanian action against Bulgaria, and support of the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest was particularly effective at inclining Romania towards the Entente. Furthermore, Russian courting of Romanian sympathies, exemplified by the visit of the Tsar to Constan\u021ba on 14 June 1914, signaled in a new era of positive relations between the two countries. Nevertheless, King Ferdinand I of Romania maintained a policy of neutrality, intending to gain the most for Romania by negotiating between competing powers. The result of the negotiations with the Entente was the Treaty of Bucharest (1916), which stipulated the conditions under which Romania agreed to join the war on the side of the Entente, particularly territorial promises in Austria-Hungary: Transylvania, Cri\u0219ana and Maramure\u0219, the whole Banat and most of Bukovina. According to historian John Keegan, these enticements offered by the Allies were never concrete, for in secret, Russia and France agreed not to honor any conventions when the end of the war came. The immediate reason for Russia's involvement in the First World War was a direct result of the decisions made by the statesmen and generals during July 1914. The July Crisis was the culmination of a series of diplomatic conflicts that took place in the decades prior to 1914, and this is fundamental to an understanding of Russia's position immediately prior to the War. According to D. C. Lieven, Russia was formidable and was able to back up her diplomatic policies with force. One of the most significant factors in bringing Russia to the brink of war was the downfall of her economy. The 20 percent jump in defense expenditure during 1866\u201377 forced them to change their position within Europe and shift the balance of power out of her favour. At the time, Russian infrastructure was backward and the Russian government had to invest far more than its European rivals in structural changes. In addition there were overwhelming burdens of defense, which would ultimately result in an economic downfall for the Russians. This was a major strain on the Russian population, but also served as a direct threat to military expenditure. Thus the only way the Russians could sustain the strains of European war would be to place more emphasis on foreign investment from the French who essentially came to Russia's aid for industrial change. The Franco-Russian Alliance allowed for the Russian defense to grow and aid the European balance of power during the growth of the German Empire's might. Nevertheless, one of the key factors was that of the Russian foreign policy between 1890 and 1914. The Russian army was large, but had poor leadership and poor equipment, and increasingly poor morale until by\n\nquestion: Who were the main countries involved in the Eastern Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Germany, France, Romania, Russia, Austria-Hungary", "usage": 1125}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Their main aim was to help overcome the legend of the \"invincible\" German war machine, in order to boost the morale of civilians and soldiers. Russian propaganda often took the form of showing the Germans as a civilized nation, with barbaric \"inhuman\" traits. Russian propaganda also exploited the image of the Russian POWs who were in the German camps, again in order to boost the morale of their troops, serving as encouragement to defeat the enemy and to get their fellow soldiers out of German POW camps that were perceived as inhumane. An element of the Russian propaganda was the Investigate Commission formed in April 1915. It was led by Aleksei Krivtsov, and the study was tasked with the job of studying the legal violations committed by of the Central Powers and then getting this information to the Russian public. This commission published photographs of letters that were allegedly found on fallen German soldiers. These letters document the German correspondents saying to \"take no prisoners.\" A museum was also set up in Petrograd, which displayed pictures that showed how \"inhumanly\" the Germans were treating prisoners of war. Also, the Russians chose to discard the name Saint Petersburg to remove the German-sounding \"Saint\" and \"-burg\", favouring the more Russian-sounding Petrograd. Austria-Hungary's participation in the outbreak of World War I has been neglected by historians, as emphasis has traditionally been placed on Germany's role as the prime instigator. However, the \"spark\" that ignited the First World War is attributed to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, which took place on 28 June 1914. Approximately a month later, on 28 July 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This act led to a series of events that would quickly expand into the First World War; thus, the Habsburg government in Vienna initiated the pivotal decision that would begin the conflict. The causes of the Great War have generally been defined in diplomatic terms, but certain deep-seated issues in Austria-Hungary undoubtedly contributed to the beginnings of the First World War. The Austro-Hungarian situation in the Balkans pre-1914 is a primary factor in its involvement in the war. The movement towards South Slav unity was a major problem for the Habsburg Empire, which was facing increasing nationalist pressure from its multinational populace. As Europe's third largest state, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was hardly homogeneous; comprising over fifty million people and eleven nationalities, the Empire was a conglomeration of a number of diverse cultures, languages, and peoples. Specifically, the South Slavic people of Austria-Hungary desired to amalgamate with Serbia in an effort to officially solidify their shared cultural heritage. Over seven million South Slavs lived inside the Empire, while three million lived outside it. With the growing emergence of nationalism in the twentieth century, unity of all South Slavs looked promising. This tension is exemplified by Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf's letter to Franz Ferdinand: The unification of the South Slav race is one of the powerful national movements which can neither be ignored nor kept down. The question can only be, whether unification will take place within the boundaries of the Monarchy \u2013 that is at the expense of Serbia's independence \u2013 or under Serbia's leadership at the expense of the Monarchy. The cost to the Monarchy would be the loss of its South Slav provinces and thus of almost its entire coastline. The loss of territory and prestige would relegate the Monarchy to the status of a small power. The annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908 by Austrian foreign minister Baron von Aehrenthal in an effort to assert domination over the Balkans inflamed Slavic nationalism and angered Serbia. Bosnia-Herzegovina became a \"rallying cry\" for South Slavs, with hostilities between Austria-Hungary and Serbia steadily increasing. The situation was ripe for conflict, and when the Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Austrian imperial heir, Franz Ferdinand, these longstanding hostilities culminated into an all-out war. The Allied Powers wholeheartedly supported the Slavs' nationalistic fight. George Macaulay Trevelyan, a British historian, saw Serbia's war against Austria-Hungary as a \"war of liberation\" that would \"free South Slavs from tyranny.\" In his own words: \"If ever there was a battle for freedom, there is such a battle now going on in Southeastern Europe against Austrian and Magyar. If this war ends in the overthrow of the Magyar tyranny, an immense step forward will have been taken toward racial liberty and European peace.\" Prior to 1915, the Russians' lack of success in war and diplomacy in the six decades before 1914 sapped the country's moral strength. The triumphs of Britain and Germany in the martial, diplomatic and economic spheres put these\n\nquestion: Who were the main countries involved in the Eastern Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Russia.", "usage": 1137}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This was a source of national pride, self-confidence and unity. It helped reconcile the worker to the state and the Bavarian or Scotsman to rule from Berlin or London. In the years prior to 1914, Austro-Russian co-operation was both crucial for European peace and difficult to maintain. Old suspicions exacerbated by the Bosnian crisis stood in the way of agreement between the two empires, as did ethnic sensitivities. Russia's historical role as liberator of the Balkans was difficult to square with Austria's determination to control adjacent territories.  In 1913\u20131914 Saint Petersburg was too concerned with its own weakness and what it saw as threats to vital Russian interests, to spare much thought for Vienna's feelings. The Russians were, with some justice, indignant that the concessions they had made after the First Balkan War in the interest of European peace had not been reciprocated by the Central Powers. This was doubly dangerous given the growing evidence flowing into Petersburg about Germany's aggressive intentions. Both Bazarov and the agents of the Russian secret political police in Germany reported the concern aroused in public opinion by the press war against Russia, which raged in the spring of 1914. The Russian military was the largest in the world consisting of 1.4 million men on duty just prior to the war. They could also mobilize up to 5 million men, but only had 4.6 million rifles to give them. It also had poor leadership. The war in the east began with the Russian invasion of East Prussia on 17 August 1914 and the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia. The Russian offensive in the Battle of Stallup\u00f6nen, which was the opening battle of the Eastern Front, quickly turned to a disastrous defeat following the Battle of Tannenberg in August 1914; even though the Russians were successfully defending at Gumbinnen a while before Tannenberg. After the Russian disaster, German troops under the command of Hindenburg inflicted another crushing defeat on the numerically superior Russian army in the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes. A second Russian incursion into Galicia was more successful, with the Russians controlling almost all of that region by the end of 1914, routing four Austrian armies in the process. Under the command of Nikolai Ivanov, Nikolai Ruzsky and Aleksei Brusilov, the Russians won the Battle of Galicia in September and began the Siege of Przemy\u015bl, the next fortress on the road towards Krak\u00f3w. This early Russian success in 1914 on the Austro-Russian border was a reason for concern to the Central Powers and caused considerable German forces to be transferred to the East to take pressure off the Austrians, leading to the creation of the new German Ninth Army. The Austro-Hungarian government accepted the Polish proposal of establishing the Supreme National Committee as the Polish central authority within the Empire, responsible for the formation of the Polish Legions, an auxiliary military formation within the Austro-Hungarian army. At the end of 1914, the main focus of the fighting shifted to central part of Russian Poland, west of the river Vistula. The October Battle of the Vistula River and the November Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a brought little advancement for the Germans, but at least kept the Russians at a safe distance. The Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies continued to clash along the Carpathian Front throughout the winter of 1914\u20131915. Przemysl fortress managed to hold out deep behind enemy lines throughout this period, with the Russians bypassing it in order to attack the Austro-Hungarian troops further to the west. They made some progress, crossing the Carpathian Mountains in February and March 1915, but then the German relief helped the Austrians stop further Russian advances. In the meantime, Przemysl was almost entirely destroyed and the Siege of Przemysl ended in a defeat for the Austrians. In 1915 the Chief of German Great General Staff, General of Infantry Erich von Falkenhayn decided to make its main effort on the Eastern Front, and accordingly transferred considerable forces there. The year began with a successful German offensive in the area of the Masurian lakes. At the same time, a large battle for the city of Przasnysz took place on the Polish front. The city changed hands several times but eventually remained in Russian hands. As a result of the battle, the Germans lost 38 000 soldiers and Russian losses amounted to about 70 000 men. In May 1915, to eliminate the Russian threat the Central Powers began the successful Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive in Galicia. After the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, the German and Austro-Hungarian troops on the Eastern Front functioned under a unified command. The offensive soon turned into a general advance and a corresponding strategic retreat by the Russian Army. The cause of the reverses suffered by the Russian Army, despite a significant numerical superiority over the German enemy\n\nquestion: Who were the main countries involved in the Eastern Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Austria and Russia.", "usage": 1136}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Only by 1916 did the buildup of Russian war industries increase the production of war material and improve the supply situation. By mid-1915, the Russians had been expelled from Russian Poland and hence pushed hundreds of kilometers away from the borders of the Central Powers, removing the threat of Russian invasion of Germany, although there was still slight Russian penetration into Austria-Hungary. At the end of 1915 the German-Austrian advance was stopped on the line Riga\u2013Jakobstadt\u2013D\u00fcnaburg\u2013Baranovichi\u2013Pinsk\u2013Dubno\u2013Tarnopol. The general outline of this front line did not change until the Russian collapse in 1917. During the campaign of 1915, the Russian Empire lost the entire line of western fortresses, and more than 4,000 guns. The causes of heavy defeats and losses of personnel, weapons, and as a result - vast territories (the entire Kingdom of Poland, part of the Baltic states, Grodno, partly Volhynia and Podolia provinces - up to 300,000 square kilometers) were to a large extent systemic shortcomings in the management of the armed forces and the defense industry. The multi-stage placement of military orders, their slow passage in the depths of the War Ministry, the disunity of the front and rear played a negative role. Thus, until the autumn of 1915, the Russian Supreme Commander-in-Chief only coordinated the actions of the commanders-in-chief of the armies of the fronts, distributed reinforcements, requesting them from the War Ministry. The Minister of War was responsible for organizing the production of weapons and ammunition, the implementation of the replenishment of troop personnel, military transportation outside the provinces declared a theater of military operations. The military districts in the theater of operations were subordinate to the commanders-in-chief of the armies of the fronts, but not to the Headquarters. Military production also lagged behind: until the end of autumn, the active army suffered from a shortage of rifles and ammunition, the consumption of which turned out to be incommensurable with the volume of production. Contemporaries also noted the isolation of the Russian commanding staff from the soldiers, the lack of practical warfare skills among the top-level commanders. \"We did have courage to send people to mass slaughter, hiding behind the difficulty of tactical responsibility, to slaughter often without purpose. We sent them, being ourselves far away, not seeing either our own or the enemy, and therefore not conforming to reality. Instead of punishment, we reward such leaders, because as far as the leaders were far away, the same, but still more, the higher leaders kept even more distant. People ceased to be people, but turned into pawns. We went to the fight in a state of some kind of oblivion and stunnedness\", wrote the representative of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Infantry General Fyodor Palitzin, in his diary. Failures in the Russian system of command and control of troops and the organization of hostilities occurred at other levels. Thus, serious shortcomings in reconnaissance led to the absence of any analysis of the enemy's plans and actions. With a general superiority in forces, almost every Central Powers's operation in 1915 was \"unexpected\" for the command from the front to the regimental level. Passion for undercover intelligence in the highest headquarters did not justify itself, and tactical intelligence was still based on barely reliable testimony of prisoners, in the absence of which the command up to the army, inclusive, was simply \"blind\". The separation of artillery from infantry with subordination to the inspectors of the corps and ammunition supply units (park brigades and divisions) created difficulties in the operational replenishment of ammunition and shells in the combat units. At the same time, huge stockpiles of ammunition were created in the fortresses, which were then delivered to the enemy during the retreat or destroyed due to the impossibility of evacuation. Special units were not created for the construction of fortifications in the rear of the troops. Most often, such work was hastily carried out by militia squads and the mobilized local population, sometimes including women, and then brought to the necessary defensive state by the combat units retreating on them, already exhausted by battles and night marches. The country\u2019s geographic expanses and a large population again became the salvation of the Russia from complete military defeat, however, by the end of the 1915 campaign, it became obvious that without a radical restructuring of the war strategy, methods of managing military potential, victory becomes unattainable, and new defeats can cause another collapse of transport (as in the case of mass exodus and the hasty \"evacuation\" of the western provinces), supplies, public administration and, as a result, the aggravation of the struggle for power in the country. Nevertheless, as before, for the military leadership of the Russian Empire, there was only one way to victory - the\n\nquestion: Who were the main countries involved in the Eastern Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Russian Empire and Central Powers", "usage": 1121}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

To some extent, the Russian side in the autumn played along with E. von Falkenhayn, who, not considering the Russian direction to have at least some strategic prospect for achieving victory in the war, made it impossible to develop the offensive of the Eastern Front. After the Battle of Sarikamish, the Russo-Turkish front quickly turned in favor of Russian forces. The Turks were concerned with reorganizing their army and also fighting the massive Allied armada that landed in Galipoli. Meanwhile, Russia was preoccupied with other armies on the Eastern Front. However, the appointment of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich as Viceroy and Commander in the Caucasus in September 1915 revived the situation of the Russo-Turkish front. When the Allies withdrew from Gallipoli in December, the Caucasus Army's Chief of Staff General Nikolai Yudenich believed Turkish forces would take action against his army. This concern was legitimate: Bulgaria's entry into the war as Germany's ally in October caused serious alarm, as a land route from Germany to Turkey was now open and would allow for an unrestricted flow of German weapons to the Turks. A \"window of opportunity\" appeared that would allow the Russians to destroy the Turkish Third Army, as the British required assistance in Mesopotamia (now modern day Iraq). Britain's efforts to besiege Baghdad had been halted at Ctesiphon, and they were forced to retreat. This led to an increasing number of attacks by Turkish forces. The British requested the Russians to attack in an attempt to distract the Turks, and Yudenich agreed. The resulting offensive began on 10 January 1916. This offensive was unanticipated by the Turks, as it was in the middle of winter. The Turkish situation was exacerbated by the absences of Third Army's commander Kamil Pasha and Chief of Staff Major Guse. Coupled with an imbalance of forces \u2013 the Russians had 325,000 troops while the Turks only 78,000 \u2013 the situation appeared grim for the Central Powers. After three months of fighting, the Russians captured the city of Trabzon on 18 April 1916. Allied operations in 1916 were dictated by an urgent need to force Germany to transfer forces from its Western to Eastern fronts, to relieve the pressure on the French at the Battle of Verdun. This was to be accomplished by a series of Russian offensives which would force the Germans to deploy additional forces to counter them. The first such operation was the Lake Naroch Offensive in March\u2013April 1916, which ended in failure. The Italian operations during 1916 had one extraordinary result: Austrian divisions were pulled away from the Russian southern front. This allowed the Russian forces to organize a counter-offensive. The Brusilov offensive was a large tactical assault carried out by Russian forces against Austro-Hungarian forces in Galicia. General Aleksei Brusilov believed victory against the Central Powers was possible if close attention was paid to preparation. Brusilov suggested that the Russians should attack on a wide front, and to position their trenches a mere 75 yards (69 m) away from Austrian trenches. Brusilov's plan worked impeccably. The Russians outnumbered the Austrians 200,000 to 150,000, and held a considerable advantage in guns, with 904 large guns to 600. Most importantly innovative new tactics similar to those independently invented by Erwin Rommel were used to perform quick and effective close-range surprise attacks that allowed a steady advance. The Russian Eighth Army overwhelmed the Austrian Fourth and pushed on to Lutsk, advancing 40 miles (64 km) beyond the starting position. Over a million Austrians were lost, with over 500,000 men killed or taken prisoner by mid-June. Although the Brusilov offensive was initially successful, it slowed down considerably. An inadequate number of troops and poorly maintained supply lines hindered Brusilov's ability to follow up on the initial victories in June. The Brusilov offensive is considered to be the greatest Russian victory of the First World War.: 52 Although it cost the Russians half a million casualties only during the first two months offensive, the offensive successfully diverted substantial forces of the Central Powers from the Western front, and persuaded Romania to join the war, diverting even more Central Powers forces to the East. The development of the Russian armament industry was mainly supported by French investors before the war. The Russian High Command saw the reason for the losses of the war in the lack of munitions. Most of these supplies were lost when advancing German troops occupied the fortifications. The production of munitions in the Tsarist empire was difficult, confidence in private enterprise among army personnel was low, and little capital was invested in the industry until 1916. About fifty percent of Russian ammunition requirements were supplied by Britain and the USA. As the Western companies were also responsible for supplying the needs of the Western Front, only a small proportion of the required quantity could be transported to Russia. In the following year, the Russian armaments industry was able to increase its production figures by a factor of two and a half and, despite the insufficient help of the Allies\n\nquestion: Who were the main countries involved in the Eastern Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Russia, Germany, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Britain.", "usage": 1162}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It is no exaggeration to say that Roumania may be the turning-point of the campaign. If the Germans fail there it will be the greatest disaster inflicted upon them. Afterwards it will only be a question of time. But should Germany succeed I hesitate to think what the effect will be on the fortunes of the campaign. \u2026 and yet no one seems to have thought it his particular duty to prepare a plan... Up until 1916, the Romanians followed the tides of war with interest, while attempting to situate themselves in the most advantageous position. French and Russian diplomats had begun courting the Romanians early on, but persuasion tactics gradually intensified. For King Ferdinand to commit his force of half a million men, he expected the Allies to offer a substantial incentive. Playing on Romanian anti-Hungarian sentiment the Allies promised the Austria-Hungarian territory of Ardeal (Transylvania) to Romania. Transylvanian demographics strongly favoured the Romanians. Romania succumbed to Allied enticement on 18 August 1916. Nine days later, on 27 August, Romanian troops marched into Transylvania. Romania's entry into the war provoked major strategic changes for the Germans. In September 1916, German troops were mobilized to the Eastern Front. Additionally, the German Chief of the General Staff, General Erich Von Falkenhayn was forced to resign from office though his successor appointed him to command the combined Central Powers forces against Romania, along with General August von Mackensen. Kaiser Wilhelm II immediately replaced Falkenhayn with Paul von Hindenburg. Von Hindenburg's deputy, the more adept Erich Ludendorff, was given effective control of the army and ordered to advance on Romania. On 3 September, the first troops of the Central Powers marched into Romanian territory. Simultaneously, the Bulgarian Air Force commenced an incessant bombing of Bucharest. In an attempt to relieve some pressure, French and British forces launched a new offensive known as the Battle of the Somme, while the Brusilov offensive continued in the East. It is certain that so relatively small a state as Rumania had never before been given a role so important, and, indeed, so decisive for the history of the world at so favorable a moment. Never before had two Great Powers like Germany and Austria found themselves so much at the mercy of the military resources of a country which had scarcely one twentieth of the population of the two great states. Judging by the military situation, it was to be expected that Rumania had only to advance where she wished to decide the world war in favor of those Powers which had been hurling themselves at us in vain for years. Thus everything seemed to depend on whether Rumania was ready to make any sort of use of her momentary advantage. The entrance of Romania into the war was disconcerting for von Hindenburg. On 15 September, Paul von Hindenburg issued the following order, stating that: \"The main task of the Armies is now to hold fast all positions on the Western, Eastern, Italian and Macedonian Fronts, and to employ all other available forces against Rumania.\" Fortunately for the Central Powers, the quantity and quality of the Romanian Army was overestimated. Although numbering half a million men, the Romanian Army suffered from poor training and a lack of appropriate equipment. The initial success of the Romanian Army in Austria-Hungarian territory was quickly undermined by the Central Powers. German and Austro-Hungarian troops advanced from the north, while Bulgarian-Turkish-German forces marched into Romania from the south. Although thought to be a tactical blunder by contemporaries, the Romanians opted to mount operations in both directions. By the middle of November the German force passed through the Carpathians, suffering significant casualties due to determined Romanian resistance. By 5 December, Bulgarian troops had crossed the Danube and were approaching the capital, Bucharest. At the same time as the Austro-Hungarian troops moved east, and as the Bulgarians marched north, the Turks had sent in two army divisions by sea to the Dobruja from the east. Eventually, the Romanian forces were pushed back behind the Siret in northern Moldavia. They received help from the Allies, notably from France which sent a military mission of more than a thousand officers, health and support staff. The Act of 5 November 1916 was proclaimed then to the Poles jointly by the Emperors Wilhelm II of Germany and Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary. This act promised the creation of the Kingdom of Poland out of territory of Congress Poland, envisioned by its authors as a puppet state controlled by the Central Powers. The origin of that document was the dire need to draft new recruits from German-occupied Poland for the war with Russia. Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918 ending the World War I, in spite of the previous initial total dependence of the kingdom on its sponsors, it ultimately served against their intentions as the cornerstone proto state of the nascent Second Polish Republic, the latter conposed also of territories never intended by the Central Powers to be c\n\nquestion: Who were the main countries involved in the Eastern Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Germany, Austria-Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, France, Britain, Turkey", "usage": 1150}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

By January 1917, the ranks of the Romanian army had been significantly thinned. Roughly 150,000 Romanian soldiers had been taken prisoner, 200,000 men were dead or wounded, and lost two thirds of their country, including the capital. Importantly, the Ploie\u0219ti oilfields, the only significant source of oil in Europe west of the Black Sea, had been destroyed before they were abandoned to the Central Powers. The Russian February Revolution aimed to topple the Russian monarchy and resulted in the creation of the Provisional Government. The revolution was a turning point in Russian history, and its significance and influence can still be felt in many countries today. Although many Russians wanted a revolution, no one had expected it to happen when it did \u2013 let alone how it did. On International Women's Day, Thursday, 23 February 1917/8 March 1917, as many as 90,000 female workers in the city of Petrograd left their factory jobs and marched through the streets, shouting \"Bread\", \"Down with the autocracy!\" and \"Stop the War!\" These women were tired, hungry, and angry, after working long hours in miserable conditions to feed their families because their menfolk were fighting at the front. They were not alone in demanding change; more than 150,000 men and women took to the streets to protest the next day. By Saturday, 25 February, the city of Petrograd was essentially shut down. No one was allowed to work or wanted to work. Even though there were a few incidents of police and soldiers firing into the crowds, those groups soon mutinied and joined the protesters. Tsar Nicholas II, who was not in Petrograd during the revolution, heard reports of the protests but chose not to take them seriously. By 1 March, it was obvious to everyone except the Tsar himself, that his rule was over. On 2 March it was made official. From this point onwards Russia was administered by the Russian Provisional Government until the October Revolution. In early July 1917, on a relatively small area of the Romanian front, there began one of the largest concentrations of combat forces and means known during the conflagration: nine armies, 80 infantry divisions with 974 battalions, 19 cavalry divisions with 550 squadrons and 923 artillery batteries; in total they numbered some 800,000 men, with about one million in their immediate reserve. Between late July and early September, the Romanian Army fought the battles of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti, M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti and Oituz, managing to stop the German-Austro-Hungarian advance, inflicting heavy losses in the process and winning the most important Allied victories on the Eastern Front in 1917. As a result of these operations, the remaining Romanian territories remained unoccupied, tying down nearly 1,000,000 Central Powers troops and prompting The Times to describe the Romanian front as \"The only point of light in the East\". On 29 June 1917, Alexander Kerensky, the Minister of War in the Russian Provisional Government, launched the Kerensky offensive to end Austria-Hungary once and for all. The Russians made only 6 miles (9.7 km) of progress but the Austrians counterattacked and drove them almost entirely out of Austria-Hungary, and they retreated 150 miles (240 km), losing Tarnopol, Stanislau and Czernowitz. This defeat was accompanied by 60,000 casualties and contributed greatly to the collapse of the Russian Army during the October Revolution. Although the February Revolution had overthrown the Tsar, the Bolsheviks still were not satisfied. In their view, the new Provisional Government was merely a more deceptive continuation of the previous government; they still refused to withdraw from the war despite how badly it was going. The upper class still wielded considerable influence in Russian economics and politics, so by September 1917, Lenin began advocating for a second revolution - one that would allow the workers and peasants to gain total control over the country.  The Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party convened on 10 October, and after much heated debate, agreed that it was time to begin planning for an armed insurrection. Troops who were loyal to the Bolsheviks took control of the telegraph stations, power stations, strategic bridges, post offices, train stations, and state banks. Petrograd was officially in the hands of the Bolsheviks, who greatly increased their organization in factory groups and in many barracks throughout Petrograd. They concentrated on devising a plan for overturning the Provisional Government, with a coup d'\u00e9tat. On 24 October, Lenin emerged from hiding in a suburb, entered the city, set up his headquarters at the Smolny Institute and worked to complete his three-phase plan. With the main bridges and the main railways secured, only the Winter Palace, and with it the Provisional Government, remained to be taken. On the evening of 7 November, the troops that were loyal to the Bolsheviks infiltrated the Winter Palace.

Lenin announced that the new Bolshevik government would immediately be seeking an end to the war, implementing a system of worker\u2019s democracy, and establishing collective ownership of all farms and factories. Lenin's new Bolshevik government tried to end the war, with a ceasefire being declared on 15 December 1917 along lines agreed in November. At the same time, the Bolsheviks launched a full-scale military offensive against its opponents: Ukraine and separatist governments in the Don region. During the peace negotiations between the Soviets and the Central Powers, the Germans demanded enormous concessions, eventually resulting in the failure of the long-drawn-out peace negotiations on 17 February 1918. At the same time, the Central Powers concluded a military treaty with Ukraine which was losing ground in the fight with invading Bolshevik forces.  The Russian Civil War, which started just after November 1917, would tear apart Russia for three years. As a result of the events in 1917, many groups opposed to Lenin's Bolsheviks had formed. With the fall of Nicholas II, many parts of the Russian Empire took the opportunity to declare their independence, one of which was Finland, which did so in December 1917; however, Finland too collapsed into a civil war. Finland declared itself independent on 6 December 1917, and this was accepted by Lenin a month later. The Finnish Parliament elected a German prince as King of Finland. However, the Socialists (The Reds) and the Whites in Finland fell into war with each other in January 1918. The Reds wanted Finland to be a Soviet republic and were aided by Russian forces still in Finland. The Whites of Finland were led by General C.G.E.Mannerheim, a Finnish baron who had been in the Tsar's service since he was 15 years old. The Whites were also offered help by a German Expeditionary Corps led by German General Goltz. Though Mannerheim never accepted the offer, the German corps landed in Finland in April 1918. After the disintegration of the Russian imperial army and navy in 1917, the Council of People's Commissars headed by Leon Trotsky set about creating a new army. By a decree on 28 January 1918, the council created the Workers' and Peoples' Red Army; it began recruitment on a voluntary basis, but on 22 April, the Soviet government made serving in the army compulsory for anyone who did not employ hired labor. Several officers who had served in the Russian Imperial Army defected to the Red Army in support of the Bolshevik cause. Many of them were of an aristocratic background but became disillusioned with imperialism and monarchism, although the Red Army still mostly consisted of ordinary workers and peasants.  With the German Army just 85 miles (137 km) from the Russian capital Petrograd (St. Petersburg) on 3 March 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed and the Eastern Front ceased to be a war zone. While the treaty was practically obsolete before the end of the year, it did provide some relief to the Bolsheviks, who were embroiled in a civil war, and affirmed the independence of Ukraine. However, Estonia and Latvia were intended to become a United Baltic Duchy to be ruled by German princes and German nobility as fiefdoms under the German Kaiser. A rump Polish state was also foreseen on the formerly Russian territories. Finland's sovereignty had already been declared in December 1917, and accepted by most nations, including France and Russia, but not by the United Kingdom and the United States. On 7 May 1918 Romania signed the Treaty of Bucharest with the Central Powers, which recognised Romanian sovereignty over Bessarabia in return for ceding control of passes in the Carpathian Mountains to Austria-Hungary and granting oil concessions to Germany. Although approved by Parliament, Ferdinand I refused to sign the treaty, hoping for an Allied victory; Romania re-entered the war on 10 November 1918 on the side of the Allies and the Treaty of Bucharest was formally annulled by the Armistice of 11 November 1918. Between 1914 and 1918, an estimated 400,000 to 600,000 ethnic Romanians served with the Austro-Hungarian army, of whom up to 150,000 were killed in action; total military and civilian deaths within contemporary Romanian borders are estimated at 748,000. The Germans were able to repair the oil fields around Ploie\u0219ti and by the end of the war had pumped a million tons of oil. They also requisitioned two million tons of grain from Romanian farmers. These materials were vital in keeping Germany in the war to the end of 1918. With the end of major combat on the Eastern Front, the Germans were able to transfer substantial forces to the west in order to mount an offensive in France in the spring of 1918. This offensive on the Western Front failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough, and the arrival of more and more American units in Europe was sufficient to offset the German advantage. Even after the Russian collapse, about a million German soldiers remained tied up in the east until\n\nquestion: Who were the main countries involved in the Eastern Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Russia, Germany, Ukraine, Finland, and Estonia", "usage": 1162}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the end, the Central Powers had to relinquish all of their captured lands on the eastern front, with Germany even being forced to cede territory they held before the war, under various treaties (such as the Treaty of Versailles) signed after the armistice in 1918. Although the Allied Powers' victory led to the Central Powers being forced to cancel the treaty signed with Russia, the victors were at the time intervening in the Russian Civil War, causing bad relations between Russia and the Allied Powers. In comparison to the attention directed to the role played by women on the Western Front during the First World War, the role of women in the east has garnered limited scholarly focus. It is estimated that 20 percent of the Russian industrial working class was conscripted into the army; therefore, women's share of industrial jobs increased dramatically. There were percentage increases in every industry, but the most noticeable increase happened in industrial labour, which increased from 31.4 percent in 1913 to 45 percent in 1918. Women also fought on the Eastern Front. In the later stages of Russia's participation in the war, Russia began forming all-woman combat units, the Women's Battalions, in part to fight plummeting morale among male soldiers by demonstrating Russian women's willingness to fight. In Romania, Ecaterina Teodoroiu actively fought in the Romanian Army and is remembered today as a national hero. British nursing efforts were not limited to the Western Front. Nicknamed the \"Gray partridges\" in reference to their dark gray overcoats, Scottish volunteer nurses arrived in Romania in 1916 under the leadership of Elsie Inglis. In addition to nursing injured personnel, Scottish nurses manned transport vehicles and acted as regimental cooks. The \"Gray Partridges\" were well respected by Romanian, Serbian and Russian troops and as a result, the Romanian press went as far as to characterize them as \"healthy, masculine, and tanned women.\" As a testament to her abilities, Elsie Inglis and her volunteers were entrusted to turn an abandoned building in the city of Gala\u021bi into an operational hospital, which they did in a little more than a day. Yvonne Fitzroy's published journal, \"With the Scottish Nurses in Roumania,\" provides an excellent first hand account of Scottish nursing activities in the Eastern Front. During World War I, approximately 200,000 German soldiers and 2.5 million soldiers from the Austro-Hungarian army entered Russian captivity. During the 1914 Russian campaign the Russians began taking thousands of Austrian prisoners. As a result, the Russian authorities made emergency facilities in Kiev, Penza, Kazan, and later Turkestan to hold the Austrian prisoners of war. As the war continued Russia began to detain soldiers from Germany as well as a growing number from the Austro-Hungarian army. The Tsarist state saw the large population of POWs as a workforce that could benefit the war economy in Russia. Many POWs were employed as farm laborers and miners in Donbas and Krivoi Rog. However, the majority of POWs were employed as laborers constructing canals and building railroads. The living and working environments for these POWs was bleak. There was a shortage of food, clean drinking water and proper medical care. During the summer months malaria was a major problem, and the malnutrition among the POWs led to many cases of scurvy. While working on the Murmansk rail building project over 25,000 POWs died. Information about the bleak conditions of the labor camps reached the German and Austro-Hungarian governments. They began to complain about the treatment of POWs. The Tsarist authorities initially refused to acknowledge the German and Habsburg governments. They rejected their claims because Russian POWs were working on railway construction in Serbia. However, they slowly agreed to stop using prison labor. Life in the camps was extremely rough for the men who resided in them. The Tsarist government could not provide adequate supplies for the men living in their POW camps. The Russian government's inability to supply the POWs in their camps with supplies was due to inadequate resources and bureaucratic rivalries. However, the conditions in the POW camps varied; some were more bearable than others. Disease played a critical role in the loss of life on the Eastern Front. In the East, disease accounted for approximately four times the number of deaths caused by direct combat, in contrast to the three to one ratio in the West. Malaria, cholera, and dysentery contributed to the epidemiological crisis on the Eastern Front; however, typhus fever, transmitted by pathogenic lice and previously unknown to German medical officers before the outbreak of the war, was the most deadly. There was a direct correlation between the environmental conditions of the East and the prevalence of disease. With cities excessively crowded by refugees fleeing their native countries, unsanitary medical conditions created a suitable environment for diseases to spread. Primitive hygienic conditions\n\nquestion: Who were the main countries involved in the Eastern Front?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The main countries involved in the Eastern Front in World War I were Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia.", "usage": 1146}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Ultimately, a large scale sanitation program was put into effect. This program, named Sanitit\u00e4tswesen (Medical Affairs), was responsible for ensuring proper hygienic procedures were being carried out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Quarantine centers were built, and diseased neighbourhoods were isolated from the rest of the population. Delousing stations were prevalent in the countryside and in cities to prevent the spread of typhus fever, with mass numbers of natives being forced to take part in this process at military bathhouses. A \"sanitary police\" was also introduced to confirm the cleanliness of homes, and any home deemed unfit would be boarded up with a warning sign. Dogs and cats were also killed for fear of possible infection. To avoid the spread of disease, prostitution became regulated. Prostitutes were required to register for a permit, and authorities demanded mandatory medical examinations for all prostitutes, estimating that seventy percent of prostitutes carried a venereal disease. Military brothels were introduced to combat disease; the city of Kowno emphasized proper educational use of contraceptives such as condoms, encouraged proper cleansing of the genital area after intercourse, and gave instructions on treatment in the case of infection. The Russian casualties in the First World War are difficult to estimate, due to the poor quality of available statistics. Cornish gives a total of 2,006,000 military dead (700,000 killed in action, 970,000 died of wounds, 155,000 died of disease and 181,000 died while POWs). This measure of Russian losses is similar to that of the British Empire, 5% of the male population in the 15 to 49 age group. He says civilian casualties were five to six hundred thousand in the first two years, and were then not kept, so a total of over 1,500,000 is not unlikely. He has over five million men passing into captivity, the majority during 1915. When Russia withdrew from the war, 2,500,000 Russian POWs were in German and Austrian hands. This by far exceeded the total number of prisoners of war (1,880,000) lost by the armies of Britain, France and Germany combined. Only the Austro-Hungarian Army, with 2,200,000 POWs, came even close. The empire of Austria lost approximately 60% of its territory as a result of the war, and evolved into a smaller state with a small homogeneous population of 6.5 million people. With the loss, Vienna was now an imperial capital without an empire to support it. The states that were formed around Austria feared the return of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and put measures into place to prevent it from re-forming. Czechoslovakia was created through the merging of the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, previously under Austrian rule, united with Slovakia and Ruthenia, which were part of Hungary. Although these groups had many differences between them, they believed that together they would create a stronger state. The new country was a multi-ethnic state. The population consisted of Czechs (51%), Slovaks (16%), Germans (22%), Hungarians (5%) and Rusyns (4%), with other ethnic groups making up 2%. Many of the Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians and Poles and some Slovaks, felt oppressed because the political elite did not generally allow political autonomy for minority ethnic groups. The state proclaimed the official ideology that there are no Czechs and Slovaks, but only one nation of Czechoslovaks (see Czechoslovakism), to the disagreement of Slovaks and other ethnic groups. Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II the conflict between the Czechs and the Slovaks surfaced again. After the war Hungary was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources. The loss of territory was similar to that of Austria after the breaking up the Austria-Hungary territory. They lost the territories of Transylvania, Slovakia, Croatia, Slavonia, Syrmia, and Banat. Italy incorporated the regions of Trieste and South Tyrol from Austria. The creation of a free and Independent Poland was one of Wilson's fourteen points. At the end of the 18th century the state of Poland was broken apart by Prussia, Russia, and Austria. During the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, the Commission on Polish Affairs was created which recommended there be a passageway across West Prussia and Posen, in order to give Poland access to the Baltic through the port of Danzig at the mouth of the Vistula River. The creation of the state of Poland would separate East Prussia from the rest of Germany, as it was before the Partitions of Poland. Poland also received Upper Silesia.

The state of Romania was enlarged greatly after the war. As a result of the Paris peace conference Romania kept the Dobrudja and Transylvania. Between the states of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania an alliance named the Little Entente was formed. They worked together on matters of foreign policy in order to prevent a Habsburg restoration. Initially Yugoslavia began as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. The State secured its territory at the Paris peace talks after the end of the war. The state suffered from many internal problems because of the many diverse cultures and languages within the state.

The Eastern Front of the First World War was roughly delimited by the Baltic Sea in the west; Minsk in the east; Saint Petersburg in the north; and the Black Sea in the south; a distance of more than 1,600 kilometers. The entire frontier had the Russian Empire and Romania on one side; and the Central Powers on the other. The Eastern Front saw the Central Powers defeating the Russian Empire in several major battles. This ultimately led to Russian withdrawal from WW1 through the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Here are the major battles and events of World War I on the Eastern Front including their dates, places and nations involved. Date: August 17, 1914 The Russian military was the largest in the world consisting of 1.4 million men prior to the war. Contrary to their enemy\u2019s expectations, the Russians were able to mobilize enough men within 2 weeks. Two Russian armies were sent to East Prussia in Germany, and four armies were sent to invade the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia. Date: August 23 to September 11, 1914, aka Battle of Lemberg By August 23, 1914, Austro-Hungarian 1st, 3rd and 4th Armies were concentrated in Galicia with the aim of invading Russian Poland. They now faced the Russian 3rd, 4th, 5th and 8th Armies in the major Battle of Galicia. The Austro-Hungarian armies were severely defeated and forced out of Galicia, while the Russians captured Lemberg. As the Austrians retreated, many Slavic soldiers in the Austro-Hungarian Army surrendered and some even offered to fight for the Russians. The Austro Hungarian casualties numbered in excess of 400,000 while that of the Russians were at 225,000. Date: August 26 \u2013 30, 1914 The German Eighth Army launched a surprise attack on the invading Russian 2nd Army and won a decisive battle near Tannenberg. The Russian 1st Army was also routed in subsequent engagements and there were 170,000 Russian casualties with minimal loss to the Germans. Date: September 7 \u2013 14, 1914 In a German offensive, General Paul von Rennenkampf\u2019s Russian First Army was pushed back and eventually out of German territory by the General Hindenburg\u2019s German Eighth Army. A German advance was however halted by the arrival of the Russian Tenth Army. Date: September 16, 1914 \u2013 March 22, 1915 As the Austro-Hungarian forces fell back over 160 kilometers to the Carpathian Mountains after the Battle of Galicia, the fortress of Przemy\u015bl was the only Austrian post to hold out. The Siege of Przemy\u015bl, the longest siege of the First World War, ended in a complete Russian victory a few months later. Date: October 29, 1914 The Ottomans, with the help of the Germans, carried a naval sortie in the Black Sea ports of Russia. The attack was conceived by Ottoman War Minister Enver Pasha and led to the entry of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. They would officially declare war on the 11th of November. Date: February 7 \u2013 22, 1915 The German Eighth and Tenth Armies launched a winter offensive with the intent of advancing beyond the Vistula River. The battle ended in a German victory giving them a toehold in Russian territory. However, the Russian Tenth Army was able to halt any further advance. In the following weeks, the Germans drove the Russians out of their remaining small enclaves in East Prussia. Date: May 2 \u2013 June 22, 1915 The Austro-Hungarians had faced considerable reverses since the beginning of the war. Due to this, they looked for German support on the Eastern Front. A joint offensive under General August von Mackensen was thus planned and launched in the Gorlice Tarnow area, southeast of Krakow. Initially conceived as a minor effort to relieve pressure on the Austro Hungarians, the offensive was a striking success for the Central Forces, who were able to decisively defeat the Russian III Army, recapture Galicia along with Przemy\u015bl and advance for miles within Russian territory. Date: July \u2013 September 1915 Suffering heavy casualties and loss of military equipment, the Imperial Russian Army was ordered to retreat from the Galicia Poland salient by the Russian Stavka, the high command of the armed forces in the Russian Empire. A strategic retreat was therefore conducted to shorten the front lines and avoid the potential encirclement of large Russian forces in the salient. The German advance was halted by Russian counterattacks in late September, and a new frontline was established from the Baltic Sea through Belarusian forests to the Romanian border.

The operation was a total failure for the Russians. Date: June 4 \u2013 September 20, 1916 The southwestern front of the Imperial Russian Army under General Aleksei Brusilov, launched one of their most successful, and the most lethal offensive in World War I. Four Russian armies were round up and the attack began on 4th June with a massive artillery barrage on Austro Hungarian lines. The offensive would end in September when the Russian resources began running out. The Austro Hungarians had by now lost close to 1,000,000 men as casualties and 25,000 sq. km of territory. Due to this, Germany had to aid its ally and send divisions from the Western Front. This, in turn, would ruin German plans on the Western Front. Date: February 18 \u2013 March 3, 1918 The last major action on the Eastern Front began with Operation Faustschlag (\u201cOperation Fist Punch\u201d). This offensive by the Central Powers saw little Russian resistance due to the turmoil of the Russian Revolution and the subsequent Russian Civil War. Huge territories were captured in the Baltics, Belarus and Ukraine, forcing the Bolshevik government of Russia to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which officially ended Russian participation in the First World War.
