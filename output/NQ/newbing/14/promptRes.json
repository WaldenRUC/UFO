Three states\u2014Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire\u2014do not offer early in-person voting, though they may provide options for eligible absentee voters. In referring to early in-person voting, states use different terminology, including early voting, in-person absentee voting and advance voting. NCSL categorizes a state as having early in-person voting if the option is available to all voters. NCSL distinguishes between \u201cearly voting,\u201d which functions similarly to Election Day voting, and \u201cin-person absentee voting,\u201d which is when a voter requests, completes and signs an absentee ballot in a polling place. From the voter\u2019s perspective, however, the experiences of early voting and in-person absentee voting are essentially the same. Additionally, eight states and Washington, D.C., run elections primarily by mail, though all retain some early in-person voting options for voters who need or prefer it. Early in-person voting periods vary by state: Statutes and information about locations, days and hours (if available) are listed below. This information applies primarily to statewide general elections. Early voting periods for municipal or primary elections may be different.

Voters were 372% more likely to vote early in the 2020 general election if they had previously voted early. If you requested an absentee ballot, then you should plan to vote with it. You can drop off your completed absentee ballot at any early voting site while polls are open. However, if you choose to vote in person after requesting an absentee ballot, you will have to vote with an affidavit ballot at your poll site. This ballot will look different. Ask a poll worker for help if you need it. Early voting gives voters more flexibility, reduces wait times on Election Day, and eases the burden on poll workers, creating a more pleasant voting experience for everyone! Early voting was signed into law by the Governor in 2019. It had bipartisan support in the State Senate and Assembly.

Three states\u2014Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire\u2014do not offer early in-person voting, though they may provide options for eligible absentee voters. In referring to early in-person voting, states use different terminology, including early voting, in-person absentee voting and advance voting. NCSL categorizes a state as having early in-person voting if the option is available to all voters. NCSL distinguishes between \u201cearly voting,\u201d which functions similarly to Election Day voting, and \u201cin-person absentee voting,\u201d which is when a voter requests, completes and signs an absentee ballot in a polling place. From the voter\u2019s perspective, however, the experiences of early voting and in-person absentee voting are essentially the same. Additionally, eight states and Washington, D.C., run elections primarily by mail, though all retain some early in-person voting options for voters who need or prefer it. Early in-person voting periods vary by state: Statutes and information about locations, days and hours (if available) are listed below. This information applies primarily to statewide general elections. Early voting periods for municipal or primary elections may be different.

Voters were 372% more likely to vote early in the 2020 general election if they had previously voted early. If you requested an absentee ballot, then you should plan to vote with it. You can drop off your completed absentee ballot at any early voting site while polls are open. However, if you choose to vote in person after requesting an absentee ballot, you will have to vote with an affidavit ballot at your poll site. This ballot will look different. Ask a poll worker for help if you need it. Early voting gives voters more flexibility, reduces wait times on Election Day, and eases the burden on poll workers, creating a more pleasant voting experience for everyone! Early voting was signed into law by the Governor in 2019. It had bipartisan support in the State Senate and Assembly.

Three states\u2014Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire\u2014do not offer early in-person voting, though they may provide options for eligible absentee voters. In referring to early in-person voting, states use different terminology, including early voting, in-person absentee voting and advance voting. NCSL categorizes a state as having early in-person voting if the option is available to all voters. NCSL distinguishes between \u201cearly voting,\u201d which functions similarly to Election Day voting, and \u201cin-person absentee voting,\u201d which is when a voter requests, completes and signs an absentee ballot in a polling place. From the voter\u2019s perspective, however, the experiences of early voting and in-person absentee voting are essentially the same. Additionally, eight states and Washington, D.C., run elections primarily by mail, though all retain some early in-person voting options for voters who need or prefer it. Early in-person voting periods vary by state: Statutes and information about locations, days and hours (if available) are listed below. This information applies primarily to statewide general elections. Early voting periods for municipal or primary elections may be different.

Voters were 372% more likely to vote early in the 2020 general election if they had previously voted early. If you requested an absentee ballot, then you should plan to vote with it. You can drop off your completed absentee ballot at any early voting site while polls are open. However, if you choose to vote in person after requesting an absentee ballot, you will have to vote with an affidavit ballot at your poll site. This ballot will look different. Ask a poll worker for help if you need it. Early voting gives voters more flexibility, reduces wait times on Election Day, and eases the burden on poll workers, creating a more pleasant voting experience for everyone! Early voting was signed into law by the Governor in 2019. It had bipartisan support in the State Senate and Assembly.

Three states\u2014Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire\u2014do not offer early in-person voting, though they may provide options for eligible absentee voters. In referring to early in-person voting, states use different terminology, including early voting, in-person absentee voting and advance voting. NCSL categorizes a state as having early in-person voting if the option is available to all voters. NCSL distinguishes between \u201cearly voting,\u201d which functions similarly to Election Day voting, and \u201cin-person absentee voting,\u201d which is when a voter requests, completes and signs an absentee ballot in a polling place. From the voter\u2019s perspective, however, the experiences of early voting and in-person absentee voting are essentially the same. Additionally, eight states and Washington, D.C., run elections primarily by mail, though all retain some early in-person voting options for voters who need or prefer it. Early in-person voting periods vary by state: Statutes and information about locations, days and hours (if available) are listed below. This information applies primarily to statewide general elections. Early voting periods for municipal or primary elections may be different.

Voters were 372% more likely to vote early in the 2020 general election if they had previously voted early. If you requested an absentee ballot, then you should plan to vote with it. You can drop off your completed absentee ballot at any early voting site while polls are open. However, if you choose to vote in person after requesting an absentee ballot, you will have to vote with an affidavit ballot at your poll site. This ballot will look different. Ask a poll worker for help if you need it. Early voting gives voters more flexibility, reduces wait times on Election Day, and eases the burden on poll workers, creating a more pleasant voting experience for everyone! Early voting was signed into law by the Governor in 2019. It had bipartisan support in the State Senate and Assembly.

Three states\u2014Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire\u2014do not offer early in-person voting, though they may provide options for eligible absentee voters. In referring to early in-person voting, states use different terminology, including early voting, in-person absentee voting and advance voting. NCSL categorizes a state as having early in-person voting if the option is available to all voters. NCSL distinguishes between \u201cearly voting,\u201d which functions similarly to Election Day voting, and \u201cin-person absentee voting,\u201d which is when a voter requests, completes and signs an absentee ballot in a polling place. From the voter\u2019s perspective, however, the experiences of early voting and in-person absentee voting are essentially the same. Additionally, eight states and Washington, D.C., run elections primarily by mail, though all retain some early in-person voting options for voters who need or prefer it. Early in-person voting periods vary by state: Statutes and information about locations, days and hours (if available) are listed below. This information applies primarily to statewide general elections. Early voting periods for municipal or primary elections may be different.

Voters were 372% more likely to vote early in the 2020 general election if they had previously voted early. If you requested an absentee ballot, then you should plan to vote with it. You can drop off your completed absentee ballot at any early voting site while polls are open. However, if you choose to vote in person after requesting an absentee ballot, you will have to vote with an affidavit ballot at your poll site. This ballot will look different. Ask a poll worker for help if you need it. Early voting gives voters more flexibility, reduces wait times on Election Day, and eases the burden on poll workers, creating a more pleasant voting experience for everyone! Early voting was signed into law by the Governor in 2019. It had bipartisan support in the State Senate and Assembly.

Three states\u2014Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire\u2014do not offer early in-person voting, though they may provide options for eligible absentee voters. In referring to early in-person voting, states use different terminology, including early voting, in-person absentee voting and advance voting. NCSL categorizes a state as having early in-person voting if the option is available to all voters. NCSL distinguishes between \u201cearly voting,\u201d which functions similarly to Election Day voting, and \u201cin-person absentee voting,\u201d which is when a voter requests, completes and signs an absentee ballot in a polling place. From the voter\u2019s perspective, however, the experiences of early voting and in-person absentee voting are essentially the same. Additionally, eight states and Washington, D.C., run elections primarily by mail, though all retain some early in-person voting options for voters who need or prefer it. Early in-person voting periods vary by state: Statutes and information about locations, days and hours (if available) are listed below. This information applies primarily to statewide general elections. Early voting periods for municipal or primary elections may be different.
