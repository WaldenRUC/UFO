It plays a key role in the recycling of matter and energy in ecosystems. It helps to control populations of decomposers and other organisms. It can help to stabilize ecosystem processes. It ensures the efficient transfer of energy from dead organic matter to higher trophic levels.", "phrase": "It provides a major source of energy and nutrients, plays a key role in the recycling of matter and energy, helps to control populations of decomposers and other organisms, helps to stabilize ecosystem processes, and ensures the efficient transfer of energy from dead organic matter to higher trophic levels."}, {"question": "What role does detritus play in aquatic ecosystems?", "sentence": "In aquatic ecosystems, for instance, detritus is an important energy source of stream food webs.", "phrase": "It is an important energy source of stream food webs."}, {"question": "What is the detritus food chain vital for?", "sentence": "The detritus food chain is vital for ecosystem stability and productivity.", "phrase": "Ecosystem stability and productivity."}, {"question": "What do detritivorous copepods feed on in the ocean?", "sentence": "In the ocean, detritivorous copepods feed on microbes attached to detritus, which may be a highly favorable strategy for these invertebrates.", "phrase": "Microbes attached to detritus."}, {"question": "What does detritus contribute to in ecosystems?", "sentence": "In summary, detritus is a crucial food source in many ecosystems, contributing to energy flow, nutrient cycling, and population control of various organisms.", "phrase": "Energy flow, nutrient cycling, and population control of various organisms."}]}
