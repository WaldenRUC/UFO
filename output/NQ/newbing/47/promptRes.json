It is based on the 1994 Walt Disney Animation Studios' film of the same name. Directed by Taymor, the musical features actors in animal costumes as well as giant, hollow puppets. The show is produced by Disney Theatrical Productions. The musical debuted on July 8, 1997 in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the Orpheum Theatre and was an instant success before premiering on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theater on October 15, 1997 in many previews with the official opening on November 13, 1997. On June 13, 2006, the Broadway production moved to the Minskoff Theatre to make way for the musical version of Mary Poppins, where it is still running after more than 8,500 performances. It is Broadway's third longest-running show in history and the highest grossing Broadway production of all time, having grossed more than $1.8 billion. The musical debuted on July 8, 1997, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at the Orpheum Theatre and was successful before premiering on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theatre on October 15, 1997, in previews, with the official opening on November 13, 1997. On June 13, 2006, to make way for the Broadway production of Mary Poppins, the show moved to the Minskoff Theatre, where it is still running after more than 10,000 performances. It is Broadway's third longest-running show in history, and has grossed more than $1 billion, making it the highest grossing Broadway production of all time. Over 112 million people worldwide have seen the musical and it has earned numerous awards and honors, including six Tony Awards, one for Best Musical and Best Direction of a Musical, making director Julie Taymor the first woman to earn such an honor. The show opened in the West End's Lyceum Theatre on October 19, 1999, and is still running after more than 7,500 performances. The cast of the West End production were invited to perform at the Royal Variety Performance in 1999 and 2008, in the presence of senior members of the British Royal Family. The theatre flooded on May 11, 2020, while the theatre was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Lion King reopened at the Lyceum in July 2021. In September 2014, The Lion King became the top-earning title in box-office history for both stage works and films, surpassing the record previously held by The Phantom of the Opera. The musical has grossed nearly $8.1 billion as of 2017. As of March 12, 2020, the show suspended production on Broadway due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Lion King resumed Broadway performances on September 14, 2021. During the week ending January 1, 2023, The Lion King achieved the highest weekly gross in Broadway history with $4.3 million. As the sun rises, Rafiki the mandrill calls the animals to Pride Rock. She greets King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi before presenting their cub to the gathered animals (\"Circle of Life\"). Elsewhere, Mufasa's brother, Scar, laments his lost chance at becoming King. Back at her baobab tree, Rafiki paints an image of the cub and asks the spirits to conjure the new prince's name: Simba. Time passes and Simba grows into a lively young cub (\"Grasslands Chant\"). Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands from the top of Pride Rock and explains that everything exists in a delicate balance known as the Circle of Life. Mufasa warns Simba not to stray beyond the boundaries of the Pride Lands, pointing out a shadowy area in the distance. Zazu, a hornbill who acts as Mufasa's advisor, arrives and delivers his daily report on the state of affairs in the King's domain (\"The Morning Report\", now cut from the Broadway production). Simba goes to see his Uncle Scar. The scheming lion piques the cub's curiosity by mentioning the elephant graveyard, where Simba is forbidden to go. Meanwhile, the lionesses go hunting (\"The Lioness Hunt\"). Simba arrives and asks his best friend, a female cub named Nala, to come with him to the elephant graveyard. He lies to the lionesses about where they are going, and Sarafina (Nala's mother) and Sarabi allow the cubs to go, escorted by Zazu. Simba and Nala formulate a plan and manage to lose Zazu, while Simba brags about his future position (\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\"). The cubs go to the graveyard and begin to explore. Zazu catches up, but they are confronted by three hyenas: Shenzi, Banzai and Ed.

Mufasa rescues the cubs and frightens off the hyenas. Mufasa is disappointed and angry at Simba's reckless disobedience, and explains the difference between bravery and bravado. Mufasa tells Simba about the great kings of the past and how they watch over everything from the stars (\"They Live in You\"). Mufasa says that he will always be there for his son. Later he discusses Simba's behavior with Zazu, who reminds Mufasa that he had the same tendency to get into trouble at Simba's age. Back at the elephant graveyard, Scar tells the hyenas of his plan to kill Mufasa and Simba so that he can become king. He raises an army of hyenas, promising that they will never go hungry again if they support him (\"Be Prepared\"). Scar takes Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there. On Scar's signal, the hyenas start a wildebeest stampede into the gorge (\"The Stampede\"). Scar tells Mufasa that Simba is trapped in the gorge. Mufasa leaps into the stampede and manages to save his son, but as he tries to escape, Scar throws him off the cliff back into the stampede, killing him. Scar convinces Simba that his father's death was his fault and tells him to run away, but as he leaves, Scar orders the hyenas to kill him. Simba escapes but the hyenas tell Scar that he is dead. Rafiki and the lionesses mourn the deaths (\"Rafiki Mourns\"). Scar claims the throne and allows the hyenas into the Pride Lands (\"Be Prepared (Reprise)\"). Rafiki returns to her tree and smears the drawing of Simba, while Sarabi and Nala quietly grieve. Out in the desert, Simba collapses from heat exhaustion. Vultures begin to circle, but are scared away by Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog. Simba feels responsible for Mufasa's death, but the duo take the cub to their jungle home and show him their carefree way of life and bug diet (\"Hakuna Matata\"). Simba grows to adulthood in the jungle. The chorus, dressed in colorful clothes with ornate bird puppets and kites, begin the Second Act (\"One by One\"). As the song ends, however, the beautiful birds are replaced by vultures and gazelle skeletons. Under Scar's rule, the Circle of Life is out of balance and a drought has hit the Pride Lands. Zazu, now a prisoner of Scar, listens to the king's woes. The hyenas are complaining about the lack of food, but Scar is only concerned with himself and why he is not loved. He is haunted by visions of Mufasa and rapidly switches between delusional confidence and paranoid despair (\"The Madness of King Scar\"). Nala arrives to confront Scar about the famine and Scar decides she will be his queen and give him cubs. Nala fiercely rebukes him and resolves to leave the Pride Lands to find help. Rafiki and the lionesses bless her for her journey (\"Shadowland\"). Back in the jungle, Timon and Pumbaa want to sleep, but the restless Simba is unable to settle. Annoyed, Simba leaves them, but Timon and Pumbaa lose their courage and follow him. Simba leaps across a fast-moving river and challenges Timon to do the same. Timon falls in and is swept downstream. He grabs a branch over a waterfall and calls for Simba's help, but Simba is paralyzed by a flashback of Mufasa's death. Timon falls from the branch and Simba snaps out of the flashback, rescuing his friend. Simba is ashamed that Timon nearly died because of his recklessness. The three friends settle to sleep and discuss the stars. Simba recalls Mufasa's words, but his friends laugh at the notion of dead kings watching them. Simba leaves, expressing his loneliness and bitterly recalling Mufasa's promise to be there for him (\"Endless Night\"). Rafiki hears the song on the wind, joyfully realizes that Simba is alive, and draws a mane onto her painting of Simba. In the jungle, Pumbaa is hunted and chased by a lioness. Simba confronts her and saves his friend, but recognizes the lioness as Nala. She is amazed to find Simba alive, knowing that he is the rightful king. Timon and Pumbaa are confused, but Simba asks them to leave him and Nala alone. Timon realizes what is happening and laments the end of Simba's Hakuna Matata lifestyle (\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\"). Nala tells Simba about the devastated Pride Lands, but Simba still feels\n\nquestion: When did The Lion King musical first debut?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1098}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

On his own, Simba meets Rafiki, who explains that his father lives on (\"He Lives in You\"). Mufasa's spirit appears in the sky and tells Simba he is the one true king and must take his place in the Circle of Life. Reawakened, Simba finds his courage and heads for home. Meanwhile, Nala wakes Timon and Pumbaa to ask where Simba is, and Rafiki appears to tell them all the news. The three of them catch up with him in the Pride Lands, where he witnesses the ruin of his home. Timon and Pumbaa distract some hyenas by doing the Charleston, allowing Simba and Nala to reach Pride Rock. Scar calls for Sarabi and demands to know why the lionesses are not hunting. Sarabi stands up to him about the lack of anything to hunt, angrily comparing him to Mufasa, and Scar strikes his sister-in-law, saying he's ten times the king Mufasa was. Enraged, Simba reveals himself. Scar forces a confession of murder from Simba and corners him. Believing that he has won, Scar taunts Simba by admitting that he killed Mufasa. Furious, Simba recovers and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the lionesses (\"Simba Confronts Scar\"). Simba's friends fight the hyenas while Simba battles Scar to the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for his life, blaming the hyenas for everything. Simba lets him leave out of mercy, but Scar attacks again. Simba blocks the attack and Scar falls from the cliff. The hyenas, who heard Scar's betrayal and are still starving, tear him to shreds. With the battle won, Simba's friends come forward and acknowledge Simba as the rightful king. Simba ascends Pride Rock and roars out across the kingdom (\"King of Pride Rock\"). The Pride Lands recover and the animals gather in celebration as Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub, continuing the Circle of Life (\"Circle of Life (Reprise)\"). + Cut from the show as of June 27, 2010 The musical incorporates several changes and additions to the storyline as compared to the film. The mandrill Rafiki's gender was changed to a female role because Taymor observed that there was generally no leading female character in the film. Rafiki was portrayed by Tsidii Le Loka in the original Broadway musical, and by Josette Bushell-Mingo in the original London production. Several new scenes are present, including a conversation between Mufasa and Zazu about Mufasa's parenting and a perilous scene in which Timon finds himself nearly drowning in a waterfall while Simba feels powerless to help him. A major narrative addition is the depiction of Nala's departure in the scene \"The Madness of King Scar\", where the mentally deteriorating villain tries to make Nala his mate. Nala refuses and later announces her intention to depart the Pride Lands and find help. She receives the blessings of the lionesses and Rafiki during the new song \"Shadowland\". Like its predecessor, the Beauty and the Beast musical, the show adds more songs to its stage production, including \"Morning Report\", sung by Zazu the hornbill and later added to the film for the Platinum Edition DVD release. \"Shadowland\" originally featured on the CD Rhythm of the Pride Lands with Zulu lyrics as \"Lea Halelela\", was adapted for the musical with new English lyrics. It is sung by Nala, the lionesses, and Rafiki. \"Endless Night\", also from Rhythm of the Pride Lands with Swahili lyrics as \"Lala\", is sung by Simba while reflecting on Mufasa's promise to always be there. \"One by One\", from the Rhythm of the Pride Lands CD, was adapted as the rousing African-styled entre act sung by the chorus at the opening of the second act. Many of the animals portrayed in the production are actors in costume using extra tools to move their costumes. For example, the giraffes are portrayed by actors walking on stilts. For principal characters such as Mufasa and Scar, the costumes feature mechanical headpieces that can be raised and lowered to foster the illusion of a cat \"lunging\" at another. Other characters, such as the hyenas, Zazu, Timon, and Pumbaa, are portrayed by actors in life-sized puppets or costumes. The Timon character is described by Taymor as one of the hardest roles to master because the movement of the puppet's head and arms puts a strain on the actor's arms, back, and neck. A new section of the production, the Lioness Hunt, features a particularly complicated dance sequence for the actresses, and the dance is made even more difficult by the large headpieces worn during the scene.

There's no animation in the musical production of The Lion King. Instead, the Serengeti is conveyed through costume and scenic design. Rafiki is played by a female in the stage show, yet Rafiki is portrayed is a male in the movie. This could be perhaps expected from a musical, but there's additional songs in The Lion King on stage. New songs include \"The Lioness Hunt\" sung by the lionesses. It takes hundreds of puppets to bring the animal kingdom to life in The Lion King. In fact, 232 puppets are used each performance. The name Simba is actually derived from the Swahili word \"simba\" meaning lion. \"Circle of Life\" features a section sung in Zulu. The lyrics translate in English to \"Here comes a lion, father, Oh yes it's a lion.\" The Lion King storyline is inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet.

It is also travelling on both a North American and International Tour. Following a similar story as Disney's hit 1994 blockbuster film of the same name, The Lion King is loosely based on William Shakespeare's Hamlet and tells the story of a young lion cub named Simba, who is next in line to the throne as King of the Pride Lands. But when Simba's evil uncle Scar stages a wildebeest stampede with the help of his hyena minions and lets his brother Mufasa fall to his death, Simba runs for his life, going as far away from the African savannah as possible. He is eventually rescued from dehydration by a meerkat named Timon and a warthog named Pumbaa, a friendly duo of bug eaters who raise Simba and teach him the philosophy of Hakuna Matata. But when the once beautiful Pride Rock decays under King Scar's rule, Simba's old childhood friend Nala goes searching for help. When she encounters Simba again by chance, the pair fall in love. But Nala leaves when she finds out Simba's unwilling to accept his own destiny to become king. Only with the help of the mandrill witch doctor Rafiki does Simba come to his senses. Can he save the animal kingdom before it's too late?

Rafiki presents Simba, the son of Mufasa and Sarabi, to the animals of the Pride Lands As the sun rises, Rafiki the baboon calls the animals to Pride Rock with two antelopes. She greets King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi before presenting their cub to the gathered animals who bow and cheer before their future king (\"Circle of Life\"). Meanwhile, elsewhere, Mufasa's very angry, wicked and evil brother, Scar, laments on his lost chance at becoming king of the Pride Lands. Back at her baobab tree, Rafiki asks the spirits to conjure the new prince's name: Simba. Time passes and Simba grows into a lively young cub (\"Grasslands Chant\"). Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands from the top of Pride Rock and explains that everything exists in a delicate balance known as the Circle of Life. Mufasa warns Simba not to stray beyond the boundaries of the Pride Lands, pointing out a shadowy area in the distance. Mufasa leads Simba through the Pride Lands during the musical sequence \"Grasslands Chant\" Zazu, a hornbill who acts as Mufasa's adviser, arrives and delivers his daily report on the state of affairs in the King's domain, (\"The Morning Report\")* while Simba takes this opportunity to practice his pouncing. Zazu reports that hyenas have been sighted in the Pride Lands and Mufasa leaves to deal with them. Simba goes to see his uncle Scar. The scheming lion piques the cub's curiosity by mentioning the Elephant Graveyard, a place where Simba is forbidden to go. The lionesses go out hunting (\"The Lioness Hunt\"), and Simba arrives and asks his best friend, a lioness cub named Nala, to come with him to the elephant graveyard, although he does not mention their intended location to his mother - he lies that they intend to go to the waterhole. Sarafina (Nala's mother) and Sarabi allow the cubs to go when Zazu accompanies them. Simba and Nala formulate a plan and manage to lose Zazu, while Simba brags about his future position (\"I Just Can't Wait to be King\"). The pride hunts during the musical sequence \"Lioness Hunt\" The cubs journey to the graveyard and begin to explore until Zazu stops them. They are about to leave when they are confronted by Banzai, Shenzi and Ed, three wicked hyenas. The Hyenas intend to have all three of the unfortunates for lunch, and gloat over them eagerly (\"Chow Down\"). Mufasa arrives none to soon to rescue the cubs and frightens off the hyenas. Mufasa is upset and angry that Simba disobeyed him. Simba says that he was only trying to be brave like his father. Mufasa explains that he is only brave when he has to be, and that bravery does not mean recklessly seeking out danger. Simba asks whether he and his father will always be together, causing Mufasa to look up to the night sky and tell Simba about the Great Kings of the Past and how they guide and watch over everything (\"They Live in You\"). Mufasa tells Simba that he will always be there for him. Scar sings \"Be Prepared\", during which he plots to take over the Pride Lands Back at the Elephant Graveyard, Scar tells the hyenas that he will soon be king if the hyenas assist him, and\n\nquestion: When did The Lion King musical first debut?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "July 8, 1997", "usage": 1127}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

At Pride Rock, Zazu apologizes to Mufasa for Simba's bad behavior. Mufasa accepts the apology but admits that he is worried about Simba. Zazu tells Mufasa that Simba resembles the King of the Pride Lands when he was a cub. Later, Scar takes Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there. Scar leaves and signals the hyenas, who start a wildebeest stampede down into the gorge (\"Stampede\"). Scar tells Mufasa that Simba is trapped in the gorge, and Mufasa races to his son's aid. Mufasa leaps into the stampede and manages to save his son, but as he climbs a cliff, Scar betrays him and throws him from the cliff, killing him. Scar convinces Simba that his father's death was his fault, as Mufasa died trying to save him, and that he should flee the Pride Lands and never return. As Simba runs, Scar orders the hyenas to kill Simba. Back at Pride Rock, the lionesses and Rafiki mourn the loss of Mufasa and Simba (\"Rafiki Mourns\"). Scar climbs to the promontory of Pride Rock, claims the throne for himself, and allows the hyenas into the Pride Lands as his executive staff (\"Be Prepared (Reprise)\"). Rafiki returns to her tree and smears the drawing of Simba, while Sarabi and Nala mourn for the ones whom they have loved and lost forever. Simba flees a stampede of wildebeests Out in the desert, Simba collapses from heat exhaustion. Vultures begin to circle, but are scared away by Timon, a meerkat, and Pumbaa, a warthog. The duo take the cub back to their jungle home and show him their relaxed way of life (\"Hakuna Matata\"). They tell Simba that they are outcasts as well and later introduce him to their diet of bugs and insects called grubs. Simba is captivated by the carefree existence, and stays. Simba stays in the jungle with his new friends for a long time- just before the end of Act I, we see the cub transform into an adult lion. Simba sings his solo and Timon and Pumbaa join in while the curtain closes for 15 minute intermission. The \"One by One\" musical sequence The chorus and Lebo M, dressed in colorful clothes with ornate bird puppets and kites, begin the act (\"One by One\"). As the song ends, however, the beautiful birds are replaced by vultures and gazelle skeletons. (In some cities, such as in Pittsburgh, some of the Ensemble would come out, and use the birds on flags, to twirl over the audience.) A drought has hit the Pride Lands under Scar's tyrannical rule. Zazu, now a prisoner of Scar, listens to the king's woes. Zazu attempts to comfort the new king by singing \"It's a Small World\". (Changed to \"Let it Go\" from Frozen in recent productions.) First, Scar has delusions of Mufasa's ghost haunting in every shadow. Then, he laments that he is not loved and arrives on the idea of finding a queen and having cubs so badly. Nala arrives to inform Scar that there is no food and no water, just as the hyenas reported the same thing a few minutes ago; Scar attempts to flirt with her, but Nala escapes (\"The Madness of King Scar\"). Utterly frustrated and upset by the current events, Nala decides to leave the Pride Lands and find help, vowing that she will never forget her pride. The lionesses and Rafiki offer a blessing (\"Shadowland\"). Back in the jungle, Simba leads Timon and Pumbaa to find a resting place while they sing \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight.\" Timon and Pumbaa want to sleep, but the restless Simba is unable to sleep. Scar mourns his unpopularity during the musical sequence \"The Madness of King Scar\" Annoyed by Timon and Pumbaa, Simba disappears into the night. Timon and Pumbaa lose their courage and follow Simba through the dark jungle. Simba leaps across a fast-moving river and challenges Timon to do the same. Timon falls into the water and is swept downstream by the current until he reaches a waterfall, where he grabs onto a branch. Simba wants to save Timon but is sent into a flashback of Mufasa's death. Timon falls from the branch and Simba snaps out of the flashback, rescuing his friend. Simba is ashamed that Timon nearly died because of his recklessness. That night the three friends look up at the stars, wondering what they are.

Simba leaves, looking up at the sky and bitterly remembering his father's promise that he would always be there for Simba (\"Endless Night\"). At Rafiki's Tree, Rafiki hears Simba's endless nightmare on the wind and comes to the joyous conclusion that Simba is alive. She draws a mane onto the drawing of Simba on her tree and she says, \"It Is Time.\" Nala sings \"Shadowland\", during which she resolves to find help elsewhere In the jungle, Pumbaa is being hunted and chased by a lioness. Simba confronts the lioness and saves his friend. The lioness flips Simba, causing Simba to recognize that the lioness is his childhood friend, Nala. Nala is amazed to find Simba alive, knowing that he is the rightful king. Timon and Pumbaa are confused by this, and Simba tells the two to leave so that he and Nala can be alone. Timon realizes what is happening and laments that he and Pumbaa's Hakuna Matata lifestyle has come to an end (\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\"). Nala tells Simba about the state of the devastated Pride Lands, trying to encourage him to return and take his rightful place as king. Simba is still guilty about his father's death and leaves. On his own, Simba meets Rafiki, who explains that his father is still alive (\"He Lives In You (Reprise)\"). As Simba looks toward the sky, his father appears as a heavenly vision. Mufasa reminds Simba that he is the rightful king and must return to the Pride Lands. Simba is persuaded and heads for Pride Rock. Simba and Nala sing \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\", during which they realize their love for each other Meanwhile, Nala wakes Timon and Pumbaa to ask where Simba is. Rafiki appears on the vine and tells them that Simba has returned to the Pride Lands to take his rightful place as king. Simba returns to Pride Rock with Nala, Timon and Pumbaa, where he witnesses the ruin that his home has fallen into. Timon and Pumbaa lure some hyenas out of their path by providing a diversion. Timon dresses in drag and does the Charleston while Pumbaa plays as the stuffed pig. Simba tells Nala to go find his mother while he goes look for Scar. Scar calls for Sarabi and demands to know why the lionesses are not hunting. Sarabi tells him that there is no food or water, the heards have moved on and that they need is to leave Pride Rock to survive. Scar refuses and when Sarabi snaps at him about not being half the king Mufasa was, Scar strikes his sister-in-law, saying that he was ten times the king Mufasa was. At this, an enraged Simba leaps down, startling Scar, who believes his nephew to be dead. Scar forces a confession of murder from Simba and attacks him, forcing him over the edge of Pride Rock. Believing that he has won, Scar whispers to Simba that he was the one who killed Mufasa. Simba, infuriated, leaps up and grabs Scar by the throat, causing Scar to reveal the truth. A fierce battle rages between the lionesses, Timon, Pumbaa, Nala, Zazu, Rafiki and the hyenas (\"Simba Confronts Scar\"). Simba encounters the spirit of his father during the musical sequence \"He Lives In You\" Simba corners Scar on the top of Pride Rock, where Scar begs for his life and blames everything on the hyenas. In a repetition of Scar's words to cub Simba, Simba tells Scar to run away and never return. Scar, with the thought of Simba killing him, appears to follow this request, but turns quickly and attacks Simba again. Simba is able to block the attack, making Scar trip and fall over the cliff where the hyenas are waiting below. They surround their former leader and kill him. The battle having finally come to an end, Simba's friends come forward and acknowledge Simba as the new and rightful king. Rafiki arrives and places the king's mantle on Simba. Simba climbs to the top of Pride Rock, hears Mufasa's voice saying \"Remember!\" and roars throughout the whole kingdom. The herds of animals gather at the call of their new king Simba and celebrate (\"King of Pride Rock\"). Rafiki, Nala and Simba ascend Pride Rock where Rafiki lifts Simba and Nala's newborn cub high into the air, thus continuing the Circle of Life and ushering in a new golden age at the end of Act 2 with the Curtain Call.

The mandrill Rafiki's gender was changed to a female role, as Taymor believed there was generally no leading female character in the film. Rafiki was portrayed by Tsidii Le Loka in the original Broadway musical, and by Josette Bushell-Mingo in the original London production. Several new scenes are present, including a conversation between Mufasa and Zazu about whether Mufasa is raising Simba correctly, and a perilous scene where Timon finds himself nearly drowning in a waterfall while Simba feels powerless to help him. A major narrative addition is the depiction of Nala's departure in the scene \"The Madness of King Scar\", where the mentally deteriorating villain tries to make Nala his mate. Nala refuses, and later announces her intention to depart the Pride Lands and find help. She receives the blessings of the lionesses and Rafiki during the new song \"Shadowland.\" Like its predecessor, the Beauty and the Beast musical, the show adds more songs to its stage production including \"Morning Report\" sung by Zazu the hornbill (a song which was later added to the film for the Platinum Edition DVD release). \"Shadowland\", originally featured on the CD Rhythm of the Pride Lands with Swahili lyrics as \"Lea Halelela\", was adapted for the musical with new English lyrics. It is sung by Nala, the lionesses, and Rafiki. \"One by One\", also from the Rhythm of the Pride Lands CD, was adapted as the rousing African-styled Entre Act sung by the chorus at the opening of the second act. Many of the animals portrayed in the production are actors in costume using extra tools to move their costumes. For example, the giraffes are portrayed by actors carefully walking on stilts. For principal characters such as Mufasa and Scar, the costumes feature mechanical headpieces that can be raised and lowered to foster the illusion of a cat \"lunging\" at another. Other characters, such as the hyenas, Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa are portrayed by actors in life-sized puppets or costumes. The Timon character is described by Taymor as one of the hardest roles to master, as the movement of the puppet's head and arms puts a strain on the actor's arms, back and neck. Composer Lebo M led the original Broadway chorus. The chorus members are usually visible in the production, rather than being hidden in the shadows as with some other musical shows. A new section of the production, the Lioness Hunt, features a particularly complicated dance sequence for the actresses, and the dance is made even more difficult by the large headpieces worn during the scene. During the show's run in China, Chinese elements were included in the musical. One of the songs was adapted to a well-known Chinese pop song, \"Laoshu ai dami\" or \"Mice Love Rice\". The cast even cracked jokes and attempted conversations with the audience in Chinese. The Lion King Original Broadway Cast Recording CD The Lion King Original Broadway Cast Recording is a cast recording soundtrack released in 1997 by The Walt Disney Company, which features a recording of the songs heard in the stage musical sung by the original cast members. Some of the tracks were composed by South African composer Lebo M as they were inspired by the tracks from Rhythm of the Pride Lands CD, which focused primarily on the African influences of the film's original music, with most songs being sung either partially or entirely in various African languages, such as Swahili. Some songs (such as \"Rafiki Mourns\") were partly written and sung by African Singer Tsidii le Loka. Note: The songs \"Grasslands Chant\", \"The Morning Report\", \"The Lioness Hunt\", \"Chow Down\", \"They Live in You\", \"Rafiki Mourns\", \"One by One\" (melody is heard in The Lion King), \"The Madness of King Scar\", \"Shadowland\" (melody is heard in The Lion King), \"Endless Night\", and \"Simba Confronts Scar\" are the new songs and instrumental music heard in the stage musical. The Lion King was nominated for the following Tony Awards in 1998.\n\nquestion: When did The Lion King musical first debut?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "1997", "usage": 968}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

As the sun rises, Rafiki the mandrill calls the animals to Pride Rock. She greets King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi before presenting their cub to the gathered animals (\"Circle of Life\"). Elsewhere, Mufasa's brother, Scar, laments his lost chance at becoming King. Back at her baobab tree, Rafiki paints an image of the cub and asks the spirits to conjure the new prince's name: Simba. Time passes and Simba grows into a lively young cub (\"Grasslands Chant\"). Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands from the top of Pride Rock and explains that everything exists in a delicate balance known as the Circle of Life. Mufasa warns Simba not to stray beyond the boundaries of the Pride Lands, pointing out a shadowy area in the distance. Zazu, a hornbill who acts as Mufasa's advisor, arrives and delivers his daily report on the state of affairs in the King's domain (\"The Morning Report\", now cut from the Broadway production). Simba goes to see his Uncle Scar. The scheming lion piques the cub's curiosity by mentioning the elephant graveyard, where Simba is forbidden to go. Meanwhile, the lionesses go hunting (\"The Lioness Hunt\"). Simba arrives and asks his best friend, a female cub named Nala, to come with him to the elephant graveyard. He lies to the lionesses about where they are going, and Sarafina (Nala's mother) and Sarabi allow the cubs to go, escorted by Zazu. Simba and Nala formulate a plan and manage to lose Zazu, while Simba brags about his future position (\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\"). The cubs go to the graveyard and begin to explore. Zazu catches up, but they are confronted by three hyenas: Shenzi, Banzai and Ed.

Mufasa rescues the cubs and frightens off the hyenas. Mufasa is disappointed and angry at Simba's reckless disobedience, and explains the difference between bravery and bravado. Mufasa tells Simba about the great kings of the past and how they watch over everything from the stars (\"They Live in You\"). Mufasa says that he will always be there for his son. Later he discusses Simba's behavior with Zazu, who reminds Mufasa that he had the same tendency to get into trouble at Simba's age. Back at the elephant graveyard, Scar tells the hyenas of his plan to kill Mufasa and Simba so that he can become king. He raises an army of hyenas, promising that they will never go hungry again if they support him (\"Be Prepared\"). Scar takes Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there. On Scar's signal, the hyenas start a wildebeest stampede into the gorge (\"The Stampede\"). Scar tells Mufasa that Simba is trapped in the gorge. Mufasa leaps into the stampede and manages to save his son, but as he tries to escape, Scar throws him off the cliff back into the stampede, killing him. Scar convinces Simba that his father's death was his fault and tells him to run away, but as he leaves, Scar orders the hyenas to kill him. Simba escapes but the hyenas tell Scar that he is dead. Rafiki and the lionesses mourn the deaths (\"Rafiki Mourns\"). Scar claims the throne and allows the hyenas into the Pride Lands (\"Be Prepared (Reprise)\"). Rafiki returns to her tree and smears the drawing of Simba, while Sarabi and Nala quietly grieve. Out in the desert, Simba collapses from heat exhaustion. Vultures begin to circle, but are scared away by Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog. Simba feels responsible for Mufasa's death, but the duo take the cub to their jungle home and show him their carefree way of life and bug diet (\"Hakuna Matata\"). Simba grows to adulthood in the jungle. The chorus, dressed in colorful clothes with ornate bird puppets and kites, begin the Second Act (\"One by One\"). As the song ends, however, the beautiful birds are replaced by vultures and gazelle skeletons. Under Scar's rule, the Circle of Life is out of balance and a drought has hit the Pride Lands. Zazu, now a prisoner of Scar, listens to the king's woes. The hyenas are complaining about the lack of food, but Scar is only concerned with himself and why he is not loved. He is haunted by visions of Mufasa and rapidly switches between delusional confidence and paranoid despair (\"The Madness of King Scar\"). Nala arrives to confront Scar about the famine and Scar decides she will be his queen and give him cubs. Nala fiercely rebukes him and resolves to leave the Pride Lands to find help. Rafiki and the lionesses bless her for her journey (\"Shadowland\"). Back in the jungle, Timon and Pumbaa want to sleep, but the restless Simba is unable to settle. Annoyed, Simba leaves them, but Timon and Pumbaa lose their courage and follow him. Simba leaps across a fast-moving river and challenges Timon to do the same. Timon falls in and is swept downstream. He grabs a branch over a waterfall and calls for Simba's help, but Simba is paralyzed by a flashback of Mufasa's death. Timon falls from the branch and Simba snaps out of the flashback, rescuing his friend. Simba is ashamed that Timon nearly died because of his recklessness. The three friends settle to sleep and discuss the stars. Simba recalls Mufasa's words, but his friends laugh at the notion of dead kings watching them. Simba leaves, expressing his loneliness and bitterly recalling Mufasa's promise to be there for him (\"Endless Night\"). Rafiki hears the song on the wind, joyfully realizes that Simba is alive, and draws a mane onto her painting of Simba. In the jungle, Pumbaa is hunted and chased by a lioness. Simba confronts her and saves his friend, but recognizes the lioness as Nala. She is amazed to find Simba alive, knowing that he is the rightful king. Timon and Pumbaa are confused, but Simba asks them to leave him and Nala alone. Timon realizes what is happening and laments the end of Simba's Hakuna Matata lifestyle (\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\").

On his own, Simba meets Rafiki, who explains that his father lives on (\"He Lives in You\"). Mufasa's spirit appears in the sky and tells Simba he is the one true king and must take his place in the Circle of Life. Reawakened, Simba finds his courage and heads for home. Meanwhile, Nala wakes Timon and Pumbaa to ask where Simba is, and Rafiki appears to tell them all the news. The three of them catch up with him in the Pride Lands, where he witnesses the ruin of his home. Timon and Pumbaa distract some hyenas by doing the Charleston, allowing Simba and Nala to reach Pride Rock. Scar calls for Sarabi and demands to know why the lionesses are not hunting. Sarabi stands up to him about the lack of anything to hunt, angrily comparing him to Mufasa, and Scar strikes his sister-in-law, saying he's ten times the king Mufasa was. Enraged, Simba reveals himself. Scar forces a confession of murder from Simba and corners him. Believing that he has won, Scar taunts Simba by admitting that he killed Mufasa. Furious, Simba recovers and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the lionesses (\"Simba Confronts Scar\"). Simba's friends fight the hyenas while Simba battles Scar to the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for his life, blaming the hyenas for everything. Simba lets him leave out of mercy, but Scar attacks again. Simba blocks the attack and Scar falls from the cliff. The hyenas, who heard Scar's betrayal and are still starving, tear him to shreds. With the battle won, Simba's friends come forward and acknowledge Simba as the rightful king. Simba ascends Pride Rock and roars out across the kingdom (\"King of Pride Rock\").

The album was certified platinum by the RIAA on January 17, 2007. Rafiki's chants in \"Rafiki Mourns\" were written by Tsidii Le Loka, who originated the role on Broadway. Robert Elhai, David Metzger and Bruce Fowler orchestrated the original Broadway production for 23 players, including: 1 wood flute soloist/flute/piccolo, 1 concertmistress, 2 violin, 1 violin/viola, 2 celli, 1 flute/clarinet/bass clarinet, 3 French horns, 1 trombone, 1 bass trombone/tuba, 1 bass player (playing both contrabass and electric bass), 1 drum player, 1 guitar, 2 mallets/percussion players, 2 percussion players (both of them at the sides of the stage) and 3 keyboard synthesizers. David Metzger reduced the orchestration to 17 players for the West End premiere of the show; integrating 2 of the French Horns, a cello, a violin, the clarinets, and one of the mallet players into the keyboard parts. Most of the current productions employ a smaller ensemble of 10 musicians (flutes, French horn, 2 keyboards, bass, guitar, drums, marimba, 2 percussionists), and fill out the rest with the electronic music system KeyComp.\n\nquestion: Where did The Lion King musical premiere after its instant success?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 791}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

There's no animation in the musical production of The Lion King. Instead, the Serengeti is conveyed through costume and scenic design. Rafiki is played by a female in the stage show, yet Rafiki is portrayed is a male in the movie. This could be perhaps expected from a musical, but there's additional songs in The Lion King on stage. New songs include \"The Lioness Hunt\" sung by the lionesses. It takes hundreds of puppets to bring the animal kingdom to life in The Lion King. In fact, 232 puppets are used each performance. The name Simba is actually derived from the Swahili word \"simba\" meaning lion. \"Circle of Life\" features a section sung in Zulu. The lyrics translate in English to \"Here comes a lion, father, Oh yes it's a lion.\" The Lion King storyline is inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet.

In case you have not yet seen this theatrical gem, then there's no better time than now to start planning for your next London theatre experience. At the very least, you'll have something to look forward to once \"this\" is all over. Here's everything you need to know about The Lion King in London's West End: The Lion King Broadway show transferred to the United Kingdom on 19 October 1999 and has been showing at the Lyceum Theatre in London's West End ever since.

It is also travelling on both a North American and International Tour. Following a similar story as Disney's hit 1994 blockbuster film of the same name, The Lion King is loosely based on William Shakespeare's Hamlet and tells the story of a young lion cub named Simba, who is next in line to the throne as King of the Pride Lands. But when Simba's evil uncle Scar stages a wildebeest stampede with the help of his hyena minions and lets his brother Mufasa fall to his death, Simba runs for his life, going as far away from the African savannah as possible. He is eventually rescued from dehydration by a meerkat named Timon and a warthog named Pumbaa, a friendly duo of bug eaters who raise Simba and teach him the philosophy of Hakuna Matata. But when the once beautiful Pride Rock decays under King Scar's rule, Simba's old childhood friend Nala goes searching for help. When she encounters Simba again by chance, the pair fall in love. But Nala leaves when she finds out Simba's unwilling to accept his own destiny to become king. Only with the help of the mandrill witch doctor Rafiki does Simba come to his senses. Can he save the animal kingdom before it's too late?

Directed by Julie Taymor, the musical features actors in animal costumes as well as giant, hollow puppets. The musical debuted on July 8, 1997, in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the Orpheum Theatre, and was an instant success before premiering on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theater on October 15, 1997 in previews with the official opening on November 13, 1997. On June 13, 2006, the Broadway production moved to the Minskoff Theatre to make way for the Walt Disney's Mary Poppins, where it is still running.

Rafiki presents Simba, the son of Mufasa and Sarabi, to the animals of the Pride Lands As the sun rises, Rafiki the baboon calls the animals to Pride Rock with two antelopes. She greets King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi before presenting their cub to the gathered animals who bow and cheer before their future king (\"Circle of Life\"). Meanwhile, elsewhere, Mufasa's very angry, wicked and evil brother, Scar, laments on his lost chance at becoming king of the Pride Lands. Back at her baobab tree, Rafiki asks the spirits to conjure the new prince's name: Simba. Time passes and Simba grows into a lively young cub (\"Grasslands Chant\"). Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands from the top of Pride Rock and explains that everything exists in a delicate balance known as the Circle of Life. Mufasa warns Simba not to stray beyond the boundaries of the Pride Lands, pointing out a shadowy area in the distance. Mufasa leads Simba through the Pride Lands during the musical sequence \"Grasslands Chant\" Zazu, a hornbill who acts as Mufasa's adviser, arrives and delivers his daily report on the state of affairs in the King's domain, (\"The Morning Report\")* while Simba takes this opportunity to practice his pouncing. Zazu reports that hyenas have been sighted in the Pride Lands and Mufasa leaves to deal with them. Simba goes to see his uncle Scar. The scheming lion piques the cub's curiosity by mentioning the Elephant Graveyard, a place where Simba is forbidden to go. The lionesses go out hunting (\"The Lioness Hunt\"), and Simba arrives and asks his best friend, a lioness cub named Nala, to come with him to the elephant graveyard, although he does not mention their intended location to his mother - he lies that they intend to go to the waterhole. Sarafina (Nala's mother) and Sarabi allow the cubs to go when Zazu accompanies them. Simba and Nala formulate a plan and manage to lose Zazu, while Simba brags about his future position (\"I Just Can't Wait to be King\"). The pride hunts during the musical sequence \"Lioness Hunt\" The cubs journey to the graveyard and begin to explore until Zazu stops them. They are about to leave when they are confronted by Banzai, Shenzi and Ed, three wicked hyenas. The Hyenas intend to have all three of the unfortunates for lunch, and gloat over them eagerly (\"Chow Down\"). Mufasa arrives none to soon to rescue the cubs and frightens off the hyenas. Mufasa is upset and angry that Simba disobeyed him. Simba says that he was only trying to be brave like his father. Mufasa explains that he is only brave when he has to be, and that bravery does not mean recklessly seeking out danger. Simba asks whether he and his father will always be together, causing Mufasa to look up to the night sky and tell Simba about the Great Kings of the Past and how they guide and watch over everything (\"They Live in You\"). Mufasa tells Simba that he will always be there for him. Scar sings \"Be Prepared\", during which he plots to take over the Pride Lands Back at the Elephant Graveyard, Scar tells the hyenas that he will soon be king if the hyenas assist him, and\n\nquestion: Where did The Lion King musical premiere after its instant success?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1125}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

At Pride Rock, Zazu apologizes to Mufasa for Simba's bad behavior. Mufasa accepts the apology but admits that he is worried about Simba. Zazu tells Mufasa that Simba resembles the King of the Pride Lands when he was a cub. Later, Scar takes Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there. Scar leaves and signals the hyenas, who start a wildebeest stampede down into the gorge (\"Stampede\"). Scar tells Mufasa that Simba is trapped in the gorge, and Mufasa races to his son's aid. Mufasa leaps into the stampede and manages to save his son, but as he climbs a cliff, Scar betrays him and throws him from the cliff, killing him. Scar convinces Simba that his father's death was his fault, as Mufasa died trying to save him, and that he should flee the Pride Lands and never return. As Simba runs, Scar orders the hyenas to kill Simba. Back at Pride Rock, the lionesses and Rafiki mourn the loss of Mufasa and Simba (\"Rafiki Mourns\"). Scar climbs to the promontory of Pride Rock, claims the throne for himself, and allows the hyenas into the Pride Lands as his executive staff (\"Be Prepared (Reprise)\"). Rafiki returns to her tree and smears the drawing of Simba, while Sarabi and Nala mourn for the ones whom they have loved and lost forever. Simba flees a stampede of wildebeests Out in the desert, Simba collapses from heat exhaustion. Vultures begin to circle, but are scared away by Timon, a meerkat, and Pumbaa, a warthog. The duo take the cub back to their jungle home and show him their relaxed way of life (\"Hakuna Matata\"). They tell Simba that they are outcasts as well and later introduce him to their diet of bugs and insects called grubs. Simba is captivated by the carefree existence, and stays. Simba stays in the jungle with his new friends for a long time- just before the end of Act I, we see the cub transform into an adult lion. Simba sings his solo and Timon and Pumbaa join in while the curtain closes for 15 minute intermission. The \"One by One\" musical sequence The chorus and Lebo M, dressed in colorful clothes with ornate bird puppets and kites, begin the act (\"One by One\"). As the song ends, however, the beautiful birds are replaced by vultures and gazelle skeletons. (In some cities, such as in Pittsburgh, some of the Ensemble would come out, and use the birds on flags, to twirl over the audience.) A drought has hit the Pride Lands under Scar's tyrannical rule. Zazu, now a prisoner of Scar, listens to the king's woes. Zazu attempts to comfort the new king by singing \"It's a Small World\". (Changed to \"Let it Go\" from Frozen in recent productions.) First, Scar has delusions of Mufasa's ghost haunting in every shadow. Then, he laments that he is not loved and arrives on the idea of finding a queen and having cubs so badly. Nala arrives to inform Scar that there is no food and no water, just as the hyenas reported the same thing a few minutes ago; Scar attempts to flirt with her, but Nala escapes (\"The Madness of King Scar\"). Utterly frustrated and upset by the current events, Nala decides to leave the Pride Lands and find help, vowing that she will never forget her pride. The lionesses and Rafiki offer a blessing (\"Shadowland\"). Back in the jungle, Simba leads Timon and Pumbaa to find a resting place while they sing \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight.\" Timon and Pumbaa want to sleep, but the restless Simba is unable to sleep. Scar mourns his unpopularity during the musical sequence \"The Madness of King Scar\" Annoyed by Timon and Pumbaa, Simba disappears into the night. Timon and Pumbaa lose their courage and follow Simba through the dark jungle. Simba leaps across a fast-moving river and challenges Timon to do the same. Timon falls into the water and is swept downstream by the current until he reaches a waterfall, where he grabs onto a branch. Simba wants to save Timon but is sent into a flashback of Mufasa's death. Timon falls from the branch and Simba snaps out of the flashback, rescuing his friend. Simba is ashamed that Timon nearly died because of his recklessness. That night the three friends look up at the stars, wondering what they are.

Simba leaves, looking up at the sky and bitterly remembering his father's promise that he would always be there for Simba (\"Endless Night\"). At Rafiki's Tree, Rafiki hears Simba's endless nightmare on the wind and comes to the joyous conclusion that Simba is alive. She draws a mane onto the drawing of Simba on her tree and she says, \"It Is Time.\" Nala sings \"Shadowland\", during which she resolves to find help elsewhere In the jungle, Pumbaa is being hunted and chased by a lioness. Simba confronts the lioness and saves his friend. The lioness flips Simba, causing Simba to recognize that the lioness is his childhood friend, Nala. Nala is amazed to find Simba alive, knowing that he is the rightful king. Timon and Pumbaa are confused by this, and Simba tells the two to leave so that he and Nala can be alone. Timon realizes what is happening and laments that he and Pumbaa's Hakuna Matata lifestyle has come to an end (\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\"). Nala tells Simba about the state of the devastated Pride Lands, trying to encourage him to return and take his rightful place as king. Simba is still guilty about his father's death and leaves. On his own, Simba meets Rafiki, who explains that his father is still alive (\"He Lives In You (Reprise)\"). As Simba looks toward the sky, his father appears as a heavenly vision. Mufasa reminds Simba that he is the rightful king and must return to the Pride Lands. Simba is persuaded and heads for Pride Rock. Simba and Nala sing \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\", during which they realize their love for each other Meanwhile, Nala wakes Timon and Pumbaa to ask where Simba is. Rafiki appears on the vine and tells them that Simba has returned to the Pride Lands to take his rightful place as king. Simba returns to Pride Rock with Nala, Timon and Pumbaa, where he witnesses the ruin that his home has fallen into. Timon and Pumbaa lure some hyenas out of their path by providing a diversion. Timon dresses in drag and does the Charleston while Pumbaa plays as the stuffed pig. Simba tells Nala to go find his mother while he goes look for Scar. Scar calls for Sarabi and demands to know why the lionesses are not hunting. Sarabi tells him that there is no food or water, the heards have moved on and that they need is to leave Pride Rock to survive. Scar refuses and when Sarabi snaps at him about not being half the king Mufasa was, Scar strikes his sister-in-law, saying that he was ten times the king Mufasa was. At this, an enraged Simba leaps down, startling Scar, who believes his nephew to be dead. Scar forces a confession of murder from Simba and attacks him, forcing him over the edge of Pride Rock. Believing that he has won, Scar whispers to Simba that he was the one who killed Mufasa. Simba, infuriated, leaps up and grabs Scar by the throat, causing Scar to reveal the truth. A fierce battle rages between the lionesses, Timon, Pumbaa, Nala, Zazu, Rafiki and the hyenas (\"Simba Confronts Scar\"). Simba encounters the spirit of his father during the musical sequence \"He Lives In You\" Simba corners Scar on the top of Pride Rock, where Scar begs for his life and blames everything on the hyenas. In a repetition of Scar's words to cub Simba, Simba tells Scar to run away and never return. Scar, with the thought of Simba killing him, appears to follow this request, but turns quickly and attacks Simba again. Simba is able to block the attack, making Scar trip and fall over the cliff where the hyenas are waiting below. They surround their former leader and kill him.

The mandrill Rafiki's gender was changed to a female role, as Taymor believed there was generally no leading female character in the film. Rafiki was portrayed by Tsidii Le Loka in the original Broadway musical, and by Josette Bushell-Mingo in the original London production. Several new scenes are present, including a conversation between Mufasa and Zazu about whether Mufasa is raising Simba correctly, and a perilous scene where Timon finds himself nearly drowning in a waterfall while Simba feels powerless to help him. A major narrative addition is the depiction of Nala's departure in the scene \"The Madness of King Scar\", where the mentally deteriorating villain tries to make Nala his mate. Nala refuses, and later announces her intention to depart the Pride Lands and find help. She receives the blessings of the lionesses and Rafiki during the new song \"Shadowland.\" Like its predecessor, the Beauty and the Beast musical, the show adds more songs to its stage production including \"Morning Report\" sung by Zazu the hornbill (a song which was later added to the film for the Platinum Edition DVD release). \"Shadowland\", originally featured on the CD Rhythm of the Pride Lands with Swahili lyrics as \"Lea Halelela\", was adapted for the musical with new English lyrics. It is sung by Nala, the lionesses, and Rafiki. \"One by One\", also from the Rhythm of the Pride Lands CD, was adapted as the rousing African-styled Entre Act sung by the chorus at the opening of the second act. Many of the animals portrayed in the production are actors in costume using extra tools to move their costumes. For example, the giraffes are portrayed by actors carefully walking on stilts. For principal characters such as Mufasa and Scar, the costumes feature mechanical headpieces that can be raised and lowered to foster the illusion of a cat \"lunging\" at another. Other characters, such as the hyenas, Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa are portrayed by actors in life-sized puppets or costumes. The Timon character is described by Taymor as one of the hardest roles to master, as the movement of the puppet's head and arms puts a strain on the actor's arms, back and neck. Composer Lebo M led the original Broadway chorus. The chorus members are usually visible in the production, rather than being hidden in the shadows as with some other musical shows. A new section of the production, the Lioness Hunt, features a particularly complicated dance sequence for the actresses, and the dance is made even more difficult by the large headpieces worn during the scene. During the show's run in China, Chinese elements were included in the musical. One of the songs was adapted to a well-known Chinese pop song, \"Laoshu ai dami\" or \"Mice Love Rice\". The cast even cracked jokes and attempted conversations with the audience in Chinese. The Lion King Original Broadway Cast Recording CD The Lion King Original Broadway Cast Recording is a cast recording soundtrack released in 1997 by The Walt Disney Company, which features a recording of the songs heard in the stage musical sung by the original cast members. Some of the tracks were composed by South African composer Lebo M as they were inspired by the tracks from Rhythm of the Pride Lands CD, which focused primarily on the African influences of the film's original music, with most songs being sung either partially or entirely in various African languages, such as Swahili. Some songs (such as \"Rafiki Mourns\") were partly written and sung by African Singer Tsidii le Loka. Note: The songs \"Grasslands Chant\", \"The Morning Report\", \"The Lioness Hunt\", \"Chow Down\", \"They Live in You\", \"Rafiki Mourns\", \"One by One\" (melody is heard in The Lion King), \"The Madness of King Scar\", \"Shadowland\" (melody is heard in The Lion King), \"Endless Night\", and \"Simba Confronts Scar\" are the new songs and instrumental music heard in the stage musical. The Lion King was nominated for the following Tony Awards in 1998.\n\nquestion: Where did The Lion King musical premiere after its instant success?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Broadway.", "usage": 972}, "Your task is to judge whether the following two answers are factually consistent.
