The Reconstruction era was the period after the American Civil War from 1865 to 1877, during which the United States grappled with the challenges of reintegrating into the Union the states that had seceded and determining the legal status of African Americans. Presidential Reconstruction, from 1865 to 1867, required little of the former Confederate states and leaders. Radical Reconstruction attempted to give African Americans full equality. The Reconstruction era redefined U.S. citizenship and expanded the franchise, changed the relationship between the federal government and the governments of the states, and highlighted the differences between political and economic democracy. While U.S. Pres. Andrew Johnson attempted to return the Southern states to essentially the condition they were in before the American Civil War, Republicans in Congress passed laws and amendments that affirmed the \u201cequality of all men before the law\u201d and prohibited racial discrimination, that made African Americans full U.S. citizens, and that forbade laws to prevent African Americans from voting. During a brief period in the Reconstruction era, African Americans voted in large numbers and held public office at almost every level, including in both houses of Congress. However, this provoked a violent backlash from whites who did not want to relinquish supremacy. The backlash succeeded, and the promises of Reconstruction were mostly unfulfilled. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were unenforced but remained on the books, forming the basis of the mid-20th-century civil rights movement. Reconstruction, in U.S. history, the period (1865\u201377) that followed the American Civil War and during which attempts were made to redress the inequities of slavery and its political, social, and economic legacy and to solve the problems arising from the readmission to the Union of the 11 states that had seceded at or before the outbreak of war. Long portrayed by many historians as a time when vindictive Radical Republicans fastened Black supremacy upon the defeated Confederacy, Reconstruction has since the late 20th century been viewed more sympathetically as a laudable experiment in interracial democracy. Reconstruction witnessed far-reaching changes in America\u2019s political life. At the national level, new laws and constitutional amendments permanently altered the federal system and the definition of American citizenship. In the South, a politically mobilized Black community joined with white allies to bring the Republican Party to power, and with it a redefinition of the responsibilities of government. The national debate over Reconstruction began during the Civil War. In December 1863, less than a year after he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Pres. Abraham Lincoln announced the first comprehensive program for Reconstruction, the Ten Percent Plan. Under it, when one-tenth of a state\u2019s prewar voters took an oath of loyalty, they could establish a new state government. To Lincoln, the plan was an attempt to weaken the Confederacy rather than a blueprint for the postwar South. It was put into operation in parts of the Union-occupied Confederacy, but none of the new governments achieved broad local support. In 1864 Congress enacted (and Lincoln pocket vetoed) the Wade-Davis Bill, which proposed to delay the formation of new Southern governments until a majority of voters had taken a loyalty oath. Some Republicans were already convinced that equal rights for the former slaves had to accompany the South\u2019s readmission to the Union. In his last speech, on April 11, 1865, Lincoln, referring to Reconstruction in Louisiana, expressed the view that some Blacks\u2014the \u201cvery intelligent\u201d and those who had served in the Union army\u2014ought to enjoy the right to vote. Following Lincoln\u2019s assassination in April 1865, Andrew Johnson became president and inaugurated the period of Presidential Reconstruction (1865\u201367). Johnson offered a pardon to all Southern whites except Confederate leaders and wealthy planters (although most of these subsequently received individual pardons), restoring their political rights and all property except slaves. He also outlined how new state governments would be created. Apart from the requirement that they abolish slavery, repudiate secession, and abrogate the Confederate debt, these governments were granted a free hand in managing their affairs. They responded by enacting the Black codes, laws that required African Americans to sign yearly labour contracts and in other ways sought to limit the freedmen\u2019s economic options and reestablish plantation discipline. African Americans strongly resisted the implementation of these measures, and they seriously undermined Northern support for Johnson\u2019s policies. When Congress assembled in December 1865, Radical Republicans such as Rep. Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania and Sen. Charles Sumner from Massachusetts called for the establishment of new Southern governments based on equality before the law and universal male suffrage. But the more numerous moderate Republicans hoped to work with Johnson while modifying his program. Congress refused to seat the representatives and senators elected from the Southern states and in early 1866 passed the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau and Civil Rights Bills.

The second defined all persons born in the United States as national citizens, who were to enjoy equality before the law. A combination of personal stubbornness, fervent belief in states\u2019 rights, and racist convictions led Johnson to reject these bills, causing a permanent rupture between himself and Congress. The Civil Rights Act became the first significant legislation in American history to become law over a president\u2019s veto. Shortly thereafter, Congress approved the Fourteenth Amendment, which put the principle of birthright citizenship into the Constitution and forbade states to deprive any citizen of the \u201cequal protection\u201d of the laws. Arguably the most important addition to the Constitution other than the Bill of Rights, the amendment constituted a profound change in federal-state relations. Traditionally, citizens\u2019 rights had been delineated and protected by the states. Thereafter, the federal government would guarantee all Americans\u2019 equality before the law against state violation. In the fall 1866 congressional elections, Northern voters overwhelmingly repudiated Johnson\u2019s policies. Congress decided to begin Reconstruction anew. The Reconstruction Acts of 1867 divided the South into five military districts and outlined how new governments, based on manhood suffrage without regard to race, were to be established. Thus began the period of Radical or Congressional Reconstruction, which lasted until the end of the last Southern Republican governments in 1877. By 1870 all the former Confederate states had been readmitted to the Union, and nearly all were controlled by the Republican Party. Three groups made up Southern Republicanism. Carpetbaggers, or recent arrivals from the North, were former Union soldiers, teachers, Freedmen\u2019s Bureau agents, and businessmen. The second large group, scalawags, or native-born white Republicans, included some businessmen and planters, but most were nonslaveholding small farmers from the Southern up-country. Loyal to the Union during the Civil War, they saw the Republican Party as a means of keeping Confederates from regaining power in the South. In every state, African Americans formed the overwhelming majority of Southern Republican voters. From the beginning of Reconstruction, Black conventions and newspapers throughout the South had called for the extension of full civil and political rights to African Americans. Composed of those who had been free before the Civil War plus slave ministers, artisans, and Civil War veterans, the Black political leadership pressed for the elimination of the racial caste system and the economic uplifting of the former slaves. Sixteen African Americans served in Congress during Reconstruction\u2014including Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce in the U.S. Senate\u2014more than 600 in state legislatures, and hundreds more in local offices from sheriff to justice of the peace scattered across the South. So-called \u201cBlack supremacy\u201d never existed, but the advent of African Americans in positions of political power marked a dramatic break with the country\u2019s traditions and aroused bitter hostility from Reconstruction\u2019s opponents. Serving an expanded citizenry, Reconstruction governments established the South\u2019s first state-funded public school systems, sought to strengthen the bargaining power of plantation labourers, made taxation more equitable, and outlawed racial discrimination in public transportation and accommodations. They also offered lavish aid to railroads and other enterprises in the hope of creating a \u201cNew South\u201d whose economic expansion would benefit Blacks and whites alike. But the economic program spawned corruption and rising taxes, alienating increasing numbers of white voters. Meanwhile, the social and economic transformation of the South proceeded apace. To Blacks, freedom meant independence from white control. Reconstruction provided the opportunity for African Americans to solidify their family ties and to create independent religious institutions, which became centres of community life that survived long after Reconstruction ended. The former slaves also demanded economic independence. Blacks\u2019 hopes that the federal government would provide them with land had been raised by Gen. William T. Sherman\u2019s Field Order No. 15 of January 1865, which set aside a large swath of land along the coast of South Carolina and Georgia for the exclusive settlement of Black families, and by the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act of March, which authorized the bureau to rent or sell land in its possession to former slaves. But President Johnson in the summer of 1865 ordered land in federal hands to be returned to its former owners. The dream of \u201c40 acres and a mule\u201d was stillborn. Lacking land, most former slaves had little economic alternative other than resuming work on plantations owned by whites. Some worked for wages, others as sharecroppers, who divided the crop with the owner at the end of the year. Neither status offered much hope for economic mobility. For decades, most Southern Blacks remained propertyless and poor. Nonetheless, the political revolution of Reconstruction spawned increasingly violent opposition from white Southerners. White supremacist organizations that committed terrorist acts, such as the Ku Klux Klan, targeted local Republican leaders for beatings or assassination.

Radical Reconstruction, process and period of Reconstruction during which the Radical Republicans in the U.S. Congress seized control of Reconstruction from Pres. Andrew Johnson and passed the Reconstruction Acts of 1867\u201368, which sent federal troops to the South to oversee the establishment of state governments that were more democratic. Congress also enacted legislation and amended the Constitution to guarantee the civil rights of freedmen and African Americans in general. In the 1866 mid-term congressional elections, voters in the North resoundingly rejected Johnson\u2019s Presidential Reconstruction policies, and Congress, dominated by Radical Republicans, decided to restart Reconstruction. The Reconstruction Acts of 1867 split the states of the former Confederacy into five military districts and specified how new governments\u2014based on manhood suffrage without regard to race\u2014were to be constituted. Thus began Radical Reconstruction, which lasted until the demise of the last Republican-led Southern governments in 1877. All of the former Confederate states had been readmitted to the Union by 1870. The Republican Party controlled the governments of almost all of them. Southern Republicanism was made up of three groups: (1) so-called carpetbaggers, recent arrivals from the North who generally were Freedmen\u2019s Bureau agents, former Union soldiers, businessmen, or teachers; so-called (2) scalawags, native-born white Republicans, who predominantly were non-slaveholding small farmers from the Southern up-country who had been loyal to the Union during the Civil War; and (3) African Americans, who formed the overwhelming majority of voters in every Southern state. African American political leaders (including individuals who had been free before the Civil War, artisans, Civil War veterans, and formerly enslaved ministers) advocated for the elimination of the racial caste system and the economic uplift of the formerly enslaved individuals. Throughout the South, more than 600 African Americans served in state legislatures, and hundreds more held local offices from sheriff to justice of the peace. Moreover, 16 African Americans served in Congress during Reconstruction, including two U.S. senators, Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce. Although the ascension of African Americans to positions of political power marked a dramatic break with the country\u2019s traditions and aroused deep-seated hostility from the opponents of Reconstruction, so-called \u201cblack supremacy\u201d never existed. Reconstruction governments served the expanding citizenry by establishing the South\u2019s first state-funded public school systems, seeking to strengthen the bargaining power of plantation labourers, making taxation more equitable, and outlawing racial discrimination in public transportation and accommodations. In the hope of creating a \u201cNew South\u201d whose economic growth would benefit both blacks and whites, the governments also made available considerable funding for railroads and other enterprises. However, those economic programs spawned corruption and rising taxes, which alienated more and more white voters. In the meantime, the South underwent a period of significant social and economic transformation. Free from white control, African Americans were able to solidify their family ties and to create independent religious institutions that would become centres of community life that survived long after the end of Reconstruction. The formerly enslaved individuals also demanded economic independence. However, in summer 1865 President Johnson had dashed African Americans\u2019 hopes that the federal government would provide them with land when he ordered that land in federal hands be returned to its former owners. Johnson\u2019s dictate invalidated Gen. William T. Sherman\u2019s Field Order No. 15 of January 1865, which had set aside land along the coast of South Carolina and Georgia for the exclusive settlement of black families. Without land, most former slaves were left with little economic alternative but to resume working on white-owned plantations. Some worked for wages, while others became sharecroppers and divided their harvest with the owner at the end of the year. Because neither pursuit offered much hope for economic mobility, for decades, most African Americans in the South remained propertyless and poor. Nonetheless, violent opposition to Reconstruction by white Southerners increased. White supremacist organizations that committed terrorist acts, such as the Ku Klux Klan, targeted local Republican leaders for beatings or assassination. African Americans who asserted their rights in dealings with whites also became targets. In 1873, scores of black militiamen were killed in Colfax, Louisiana, after surrendering to armed whites intent on seizing control of the local government. Increasingly, the new Southern governments looked to Washington, D.C., for assistance. With Republican Ulysses S. Grant having been elected president in fall 1868, by the next year the Republican Party was firmly in control of all three branches of the federal government.

They were led by Thaddeus Stevens in the House of Representatives and Charles Sumner in the Senate. The Radicals were known for their opposition to slavery, their efforts to ensure emancipation and civil rights for Blacks, and their strong opinions on post-war Reconstruction. They were also critical towards many policies of both President Abraham Lincoln and his successor, Andrew Johnson. Throughout the lifespan of the Radical Republican faction, they made enemies with Democrats, many former slave owners, the Ku Klux Klan, and often even found opposition from the moderate Republicans. During the Civil War, the Radical Republicans created a Joint Committee on the Conduct of War, with which they sought to investigate President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s wartime decisions and monitor the progress of the Union. The Committee worked to keep the Executive powers in check. The chairman of the Committee was Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio, who would later co-author the Radicals' plan for Reconstruction, the Wade-Davis Bill. Throughout the war, the group often criticized President Lincoln and pressured him to support their legislation. While President Lincoln wanted to fight the war largely for the preservation of the Union, the Radical Republicans believed the primary reason for fighting was for the abolition of slavery. Most of their critiques towards Lincoln were targeted at his lack of aggression in his policies, especially regarding rights for Blacks. As the end of the war drew near, the Radicals strongly disagreed with President Lincoln\u2019s proposed post-war Reconstruction plans. Whereas Lincoln wanted to peacefully recreate coexistence between the Union and the Confederate States, the Radical Republicans felt that the rebel states needed a strong hand of justice and the administration of harsh punishments for their actions. Two Radical Republicans, Senator Benjamin Wade and Representative Henry Winter Davis penned the Wade-Davis Bill in 1864, an alternative to Lincoln\u2019s Reconstruction plans. The Wade-Davis Bill called for strict conditions and punishments for the Confederate states prior to their reentry into the Union. The Radicals felt strongly that the Confederates needed to be punished for their pro-slavery views and should only be readmitted to the Union after they had abolished slavery among other conditions. They believed that government intervention in states was necessary to ensure abolition and civil rights for Blacks. However, President Lincoln vetoed their Bill, which created more hostility towards him from the Radicals. Following the end of the Civil War, the Radical Republicans took a stance against Lincoln\u2019s successor, President Andrew Johnson. They saw no effort in this new President's policies to create rights for Blacks. President Johnson would prove to be an opponent to the Radicals as they realized that he cared little about Black rights. In 1866, the tide turned in favor of the Radicals as they gained the majority of power in Congress. With this majority power, they were able to effectively push their own legislation through Congress during the era of Reconstruction. Throughout this post-war period, they fought for the eradication of slavery and civil rights for Blacks. President Johnson tried to stand as an obstacle to the goals of the Radicals and often vetoed the bills that Congress would pass. Overall, Johnson vetoed 21 bills passed by Congress, including many that were geared toward establishing rights for Blacks.

The Reconstruction Acts were a renewed effort by the Radical Republicans to take control of reintegrating the previous Confederate states through harsher measures. Their previous attempt to control Reconstruction by means of the Wade-Davis Bill was vetoed by President Lincoln two years prior, but because they now had control of Congress, the Radicals pushed their agenda once more. These new Reconstruction Acts were passed and called for each rebel state to draft a new constitution as well as ratify the new Fourteenth Amendment. Congress, meaning primarily Radical Republicans, would then have to approve these new state constitutions before readmitting the rebel state back into the Union. The Reconstruction Acts also disenfranchised previous Confederate leaders and established that the new Southern leaders would only be those who supported the Union during the Civil War. Furthermore, they deployed military troops to the South to maintain order and to protect the rights of Black citizens. In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was passed, granting Blacks the right to vote.

The Reconstruction era was the period after the American Civil War from 1865 to 1877, during which the United States grappled with the challenges of reintegrating into the Union the states that had seceded and determining the legal status of African Americans. Presidential Reconstruction, from 1865 to 1867, required little of the former Confederate states and leaders. Radical Reconstruction attempted to give African Americans full equality. The Reconstruction era redefined U.S. citizenship and expanded the franchise, changed the relationship between the federal government and the governments of the states, and highlighted the differences between political and economic democracy. While U.S. Pres. Andrew Johnson attempted to return the Southern states to essentially the condition they were in before the American Civil War, Republicans in Congress passed laws and amendments that affirmed the \u201cequality of all men before the law\u201d and prohibited racial discrimination, that made African Americans full U.S. citizens, and that forbade laws to prevent African Americans from voting. During a brief period in the Reconstruction era, African Americans voted in large numbers and held public office at almost every level, including in both houses of Congress. However, this provoked a violent backlash from whites who did not want to relinquish supremacy. The backlash succeeded, and the promises of Reconstruction were mostly unfulfilled. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were unenforced but remained on the books, forming the basis of the mid-20th-century civil rights movement. Reconstruction, in U.S. history, the period (1865\u201377) that followed the American Civil War and during which attempts were made to redress the inequities of slavery and its political, social, and economic legacy and to solve the problems arising from the readmission to the Union of the 11 states that had seceded at or before the outbreak of war. Long portrayed by many historians as a time when vindictive Radical Republicans fastened Black supremacy upon the defeated Confederacy, Reconstruction has since the late 20th century been viewed more sympathetically as a laudable experiment in interracial democracy. Reconstruction witnessed far-reaching changes in America\u2019s political life. At the national level, new laws and constitutional amendments permanently altered the federal system and the definition of American citizenship. In the South, a politically mobilized Black community joined with white allies to bring the Republican Party to power, and with it a redefinition of the responsibilities of government. The national debate over Reconstruction began during the Civil War. In December 1863, less than a year after he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Pres. Abraham Lincoln announced the first comprehensive program for Reconstruction, the Ten Percent Plan. Under it, when one-tenth of a state\u2019s prewar voters took an oath of loyalty, they could establish a new state government. To Lincoln, the plan was an attempt to weaken the Confederacy rather than a blueprint for the postwar South. It was put into operation in parts of the Union-occupied Confederacy, but none of the new governments achieved broad local support. In 1864 Congress enacted (and Lincoln pocket vetoed) the Wade-Davis Bill, which proposed to delay the formation of new Southern governments until a majority of voters had taken a loyalty oath. Some Republicans were already convinced that equal rights for the former slaves had to accompany the South\u2019s readmission to the Union. In his last speech, on April 11, 1865, Lincoln, referring to Reconstruction in Louisiana, expressed the view that some Blacks\u2014the \u201cvery intelligent\u201d and those who had served in the Union army\u2014ought to enjoy the right to vote. Following Lincoln\u2019s assassination in April 1865, Andrew Johnson became president and inaugurated the period of Presidential Reconstruction (1865\u201367). Johnson offered a pardon to all Southern whites except Confederate leaders and wealthy planters (although most of these subsequently received individual pardons), restoring their political rights and all property except slaves. He also outlined how new state governments would be created. Apart from the requirement that they abolish slavery, repudiate secession, and abrogate the Confederate debt, these governments were granted a free hand in managing their affairs. They responded by enacting the Black codes, laws that required African Americans to sign yearly labour contracts and in other ways sought to limit the freedmen\u2019s economic options and reestablish plantation discipline. African Americans strongly resisted the implementation of these measures, and they seriously undermined Northern support for Johnson\u2019s policies. When Congress assembled in December 1865, Radical Republicans such as Rep. Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania and Sen. Charles Sumner from Massachusetts called for the establishment of new Southern governments based on equality before the law and universal male suffrage. But the more numerous moderate Republicans hoped to work with Johnson while modifying his program. Congress refused to seat the representatives and senators elected from the Southern states and in early 1866 passed the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau and Civil Rights Bills.

The second defined all persons born in the United States as national citizens, who were to enjoy equality before the law. A combination of personal stubbornness, fervent belief in states\u2019 rights, and racist convictions led Johnson to reject these bills, causing a permanent rupture between himself and Congress. The Civil Rights Act became the first significant legislation in American history to become law over a president\u2019s veto. Shortly thereafter, Congress approved the Fourteenth Amendment, which put the principle of birthright citizenship into the Constitution and forbade states to deprive any citizen of the \u201cequal protection\u201d of the laws. Arguably the most important addition to the Constitution other than the Bill of Rights, the amendment constituted a profound change in federal-state relations. Traditionally, citizens\u2019 rights had been delineated and protected by the states. Thereafter, the federal government would guarantee all Americans\u2019 equality before the law against state violation. In the fall 1866 congressional elections, Northern voters overwhelmingly repudiated Johnson\u2019s policies. Congress decided to begin Reconstruction anew. The Reconstruction Acts of 1867 divided the South into five military districts and outlined how new governments, based on manhood suffrage without regard to race, were to be established. Thus began the period of Radical or Congressional Reconstruction, which lasted until the end of the last Southern Republican governments in 1877. By 1870 all the former Confederate states had been readmitted to the Union, and nearly all were controlled by the Republican Party. Three groups made up Southern Republicanism. Carpetbaggers, or recent arrivals from the North, were former Union soldiers, teachers, Freedmen\u2019s Bureau agents, and businessmen. The second large group, scalawags, or native-born white Republicans, included some businessmen and planters, but most were nonslaveholding small farmers from the Southern up-country. Loyal to the Union during the Civil War, they saw the Republican Party as a means of keeping Confederates from regaining power in the South. In every state, African Americans formed the overwhelming majority of Southern Republican voters. From the beginning of Reconstruction, Black conventions and newspapers throughout the South had called for the extension of full civil and political rights to African Americans. Composed of those who had been free before the Civil War plus slave ministers, artisans, and Civil War veterans, the Black political leadership pressed for the elimination of the racial caste system and the economic uplifting of the former slaves. Sixteen African Americans served in Congress during Reconstruction\u2014including Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce in the U.S. Senate\u2014more than 600 in state legislatures, and hundreds more in local offices from sheriff to justice of the peace scattered across the South. So-called \u201cBlack supremacy\u201d never existed, but the advent of African Americans in positions of political power marked a dramatic break with the country\u2019s traditions and aroused bitter hostility from Reconstruction\u2019s opponents. Serving an expanded citizenry, Reconstruction governments established the South\u2019s first state-funded public school systems, sought to strengthen the bargaining power of plantation labourers, made taxation more equitable, and outlawed racial discrimination in public transportation and accommodations. They also offered lavish aid to railroads and other enterprises in the hope of creating a \u201cNew South\u201d whose economic expansion would benefit Blacks and whites alike. But the economic program spawned corruption and rising taxes, alienating increasing numbers of white voters. Meanwhile, the social and economic transformation of the South proceeded apace. To Blacks, freedom meant independence from white control. Reconstruction provided the opportunity for African Americans to solidify their family ties and to create independent religious institutions, which became centres of community life that survived long after Reconstruction ended. The former slaves also demanded economic independence. Blacks\u2019 hopes that the federal government would provide them with land had been raised by Gen. William T. Sherman\u2019s Field Order No. 15 of January 1865, which set aside a large swath of land along the coast of South Carolina and Georgia for the exclusive settlement of Black families, and by the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act of March, which authorized the bureau to rent or sell land in its possession to former slaves. But President Johnson in the summer of 1865 ordered land in federal hands to be returned to its former owners. The dream of \u201c40 acres and a mule\u201d was stillborn. Lacking land, most former slaves had little economic alternative other than resuming work on plantations owned by whites. Some worked for wages, others as sharecroppers, who divided the crop with the owner at the end of the year. Neither status offered much hope for economic mobility. For decades, most Southern Blacks remained propertyless and poor. Nonetheless, the political revolution of Reconstruction spawned increasingly violent opposition from white Southerners. White supremacist organizations that committed terrorist acts, such as the Ku Klux Klan, targeted local Republican leaders for beatings or assassination.

At Colfax, Louisiana, in 1873, scores of Black militiamen were killed after surrendering to armed whites intent on seizing control of local government.

Although the Senate, by a single vote, failed to remove him from office, Johnson\u2019s power to obstruct the course of Reconstruction was gone. Republican Ulysses S. Grant was elected president that fall (see United States presidential election of 1868). Soon afterward, Congress approved the Fifteenth Amendment, prohibiting states from restricting the right to vote because of race. Then it enacted a series of Enforcement Acts authorizing national action to suppress political violence. In 1871 the administration launched a legal and military offensive that destroyed the Klan.

Radical Reconstruction, process and period of Reconstruction during which the Radical Republicans in the U.S. Congress seized control of Reconstruction from Pres. Andrew Johnson and passed the Reconstruction Acts of 1867\u201368, which sent federal troops to the South to oversee the establishment of state governments that were more democratic. Congress also enacted legislation and amended the Constitution to guarantee the civil rights of freedmen and African Americans in general. In the 1866 mid-term congressional elections, voters in the North resoundingly rejected Johnson\u2019s Presidential Reconstruction policies, and Congress, dominated by Radical Republicans, decided to restart Reconstruction. The Reconstruction Acts of 1867 split the states of the former Confederacy into five military districts and specified how new governments\u2014based on manhood suffrage without regard to race\u2014were to be constituted. Thus began Radical Reconstruction, which lasted until the demise of the last Republican-led Southern governments in 1877. All of the former Confederate states had been readmitted to the Union by 1870. The Republican Party controlled the governments of almost all of them. Southern Republicanism was made up of three groups: (1) so-called carpetbaggers, recent arrivals from the North who generally were Freedmen\u2019s Bureau agents, former Union soldiers, businessmen, or teachers; so-called (2) scalawags, native-born white Republicans, who predominantly were non-slaveholding small farmers from the Southern up-country who had been loyal to the Union during the Civil War; and (3) African Americans, who formed the overwhelming majority of voters in every Southern state. African American political leaders (including individuals who had been free before the Civil War, artisans, Civil War veterans, and formerly enslaved ministers) advocated for the elimination of the racial caste system and the economic uplift of the formerly enslaved individuals. Throughout the South, more than 600 African Americans served in state legislatures, and hundreds more held local offices from sheriff to justice of the peace. Moreover, 16 African Americans served in Congress during Reconstruction, including two U.S. senators, Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce. Although the ascension of African Americans to positions of political power marked a dramatic break with the country\u2019s traditions and aroused deep-seated hostility from the opponents of Reconstruction, so-called \u201cblack supremacy\u201d never existed. Reconstruction governments served the expanding citizenry by establishing the South\u2019s first state-funded public school systems, seeking to strengthen the bargaining power of plantation labourers, making taxation more equitable, and outlawing racial discrimination in public transportation and accommodations. In the hope of creating a \u201cNew South\u201d whose economic growth would benefit both blacks and whites, the governments also made available considerable funding for railroads and other enterprises. However, those economic programs spawned corruption and rising taxes, which alienated more and more white voters. In the meantime, the South underwent a period of significant social and economic transformation. Free from white control, African Americans were able to solidify their family ties and to create independent religious institutions that would become centres of community life that survived long after the end of Reconstruction. The formerly enslaved individuals also demanded economic independence. However, in summer 1865 President Johnson had dashed African Americans\u2019 hopes that the federal government would provide them with land when he ordered that land in federal hands be returned to its former owners. Johnson\u2019s dictate invalidated Gen. William T. Sherman\u2019s Field Order No. 15 of January 1865, which had set aside land along the coast of South Carolina and Georgia for the exclusive settlement of black families. Without land, most former slaves were left with little economic alternative but to resume working on white-owned plantations. Some worked for wages, while others became sharecroppers and divided their harvest with the owner at the end of the year. Because neither pursuit offered much hope for economic mobility, for decades, most African Americans in the South remained propertyless and poor. Nonetheless, violent opposition to Reconstruction by white Southerners increased. White supremacist organizations that committed terrorist acts, such as the Ku Klux Klan, targeted local Republican leaders for beatings or assassination. African Americans who asserted their rights in dealings with whites also became targets. In 1873, scores of black militiamen were killed in Colfax, Louisiana, after surrendering to armed whites intent on seizing control of the local government.

They were led by Thaddeus Stevens in the House of Representatives and Charles Sumner in the Senate. The Radicals were known for their opposition to slavery, their efforts to ensure emancipation and civil rights for Blacks, and their strong opinions on post-war Reconstruction. They were also critical towards many policies of both President Abraham Lincoln and his successor, Andrew Johnson. Throughout the lifespan of the Radical Republican faction, they made enemies with Democrats, many former slave owners, the Ku Klux Klan, and often even found opposition from the moderate Republicans. During the Civil War, the Radical Republicans created a Joint Committee on the Conduct of War, with which they sought to investigate President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s wartime decisions and monitor the progress of the Union. The Committee worked to keep the Executive powers in check. The chairman of the Committee was Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio, who would later co-author the Radicals' plan for Reconstruction, the Wade-Davis Bill. Throughout the war, the group often criticized President Lincoln and pressured him to support their legislation. While President Lincoln wanted to fight the war largely for the preservation of the Union, the Radical Republicans believed the primary reason for fighting was for the abolition of slavery. Most of their critiques towards Lincoln were targeted at his lack of aggression in his policies, especially regarding rights for Blacks. As the end of the war drew near, the Radicals strongly disagreed with President Lincoln\u2019s proposed post-war Reconstruction plans. Whereas Lincoln wanted to peacefully recreate coexistence between the Union and the Confederate States, the Radical Republicans felt that the rebel states needed a strong hand of justice and the administration of harsh punishments for their actions. Two Radical Republicans, Senator Benjamin Wade and Representative Henry Winter Davis penned the Wade-Davis Bill in 1864, an alternative to Lincoln\u2019s Reconstruction plans. The Wade-Davis Bill called for strict conditions and punishments for the Confederate states prior to their reentry into the Union. The Radicals felt strongly that the Confederates needed to be punished for their pro-slavery views and should only be readmitted to the Union after they had abolished slavery among other conditions. They believed that government intervention in states was necessary to ensure abolition and civil rights for Blacks. However, President Lincoln vetoed their Bill, which created more hostility towards him from the Radicals. Following the end of the Civil War, the Radical Republicans took a stance against Lincoln\u2019s successor, President Andrew Johnson. They saw no effort in this new President's policies to create rights for Blacks. President Johnson would prove to be an opponent to the Radicals as they realized that he cared little about Black rights. In 1866, the tide turned in favor of the Radicals as they gained the majority of power in Congress. With this majority power, they were able to effectively push their own legislation through Congress during the era of Reconstruction. Throughout this post-war period, they fought for the eradication of slavery and civil rights for Blacks. President Johnson tried to stand as an obstacle to the goals of the Radicals and often vetoed the bills that Congress would pass. Overall, Johnson vetoed 21 bills passed by Congress, including many that were geared toward establishing rights for Blacks. However, because the Radicals controlled Congress, they successfully overruled 15 of Johnson\u2019s vetoes, including the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Reconstruction Acts of 1867. Eventually, the Radicals in the House of Representatives were successful in impeaching President Johnson, but he was acquitted in the Senate by 1 vote. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was an effort by the Radical Republicans to reinforce to the Thirteenth Amendment that abolished slavery and had been passed the year prior.

Some Republicans were already convinced that equal rights for the former slaves had to accompany the South\u2019s readmission to the Union. In his last speech, on April 11, 1865, Lincoln, referring to Reconstruction in Louisiana, expressed the view that some Blacks\u2014the \u201cvery intelligent\u201d and those who had served in the Union army\u2014ought to enjoy the right to vote. Following Lincoln\u2019s assassination in April 1865, Andrew Johnson became president and inaugurated the period of Presidential Reconstruction (1865\u201367). Johnson offered a pardon to all Southern whites except Confederate leaders and wealthy planters (although most of these subsequently received individual pardons), restoring their political rights and all property except slaves. He also outlined how new state governments would be created. Apart from the requirement that they abolish slavery, repudiate secession, and abrogate the Confederate debt, these governments were granted a free hand in managing their affairs. They responded by enacting the Black codes, laws that required African Americans to sign yearly labour contracts and in other ways sought to limit the freedmen\u2019s economic options and reestablish plantation discipline. African Americans strongly resisted the implementation of these measures, and they seriously undermined Northern support for Johnson\u2019s policies. When Congress assembled in December 1865, Radical Republicans such as Rep. Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania and Sen. Charles Sumner from Massachusetts called for the establishment of new Southern governments based on equality before the law and universal male suffrage. But the more numerous moderate Republicans hoped to work with Johnson while modifying his program. Congress refused to seat the representatives and senators elected from the Southern states and in early 1866 passed the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau and Civil Rights Bills.

The second defined all persons born in the United States as national citizens, who were to enjoy equality before the law. A combination of personal stubbornness, fervent belief in states\u2019 rights, and racist convictions led Johnson to reject these bills, causing a permanent rupture between himself and Congress. The Civil Rights Act became the first significant legislation in American history to become law over a president\u2019s veto. Shortly thereafter, Congress approved the Fourteenth Amendment, which put the principle of birthright citizenship into the Constitution and forbade states to deprive any citizen of the \u201cequal protection\u201d of the laws. Arguably the most important addition to the Constitution other than the Bill of Rights, the amendment constituted a profound change in federal-state relations. Traditionally, citizens\u2019 rights had been delineated and protected by the states. Thereafter, the federal government would guarantee all Americans\u2019 equality before the law against state violation. In the fall 1866 congressional elections, Northern voters overwhelmingly repudiated Johnson\u2019s policies. Congress decided to begin Reconstruction anew. The Reconstruction Acts of 1867 divided the South into five military districts and outlined how new governments, based on manhood suffrage without regard to race, were to be established. Thus began the period of Radical or Congressional Reconstruction, which lasted until the end of the last Southern Republican governments in 1877. By 1870 all the former Confederate states had been readmitted to the Union, and nearly all were controlled by the Republican Party. Three groups made up Southern Republicanism. Carpetbaggers, or recent arrivals from the North, were former Union soldiers, teachers, Freedmen\u2019s Bureau agents, and businessmen. The second large group, scalawags, or native-born white Republicans, included some businessmen and planters, but most were nonslaveholding small farmers from the Southern up-country. Loyal to the Union during the Civil War, they saw the Republican Party as a means of keeping Confederates from regaining power in the South. In every state, African Americans formed the overwhelming majority of Southern Republican voters. From the beginning of Reconstruction, Black conventions and newspapers throughout the South had called for the extension of full civil and political rights to African Americans. Composed of those who had been free before the Civil War plus slave ministers, artisans, and Civil War veterans, the Black political leadership pressed for the elimination of the racial caste system and the economic uplifting of the former slaves. Sixteen African Americans served in Congress during Reconstruction\u2014including Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce in the U.S. Senate\u2014more than 600 in state legislatures, and hundreds more in local offices from sheriff to justice of the peace scattered across the South. So-called \u201cBlack supremacy\u201d never existed, but the advent of African Americans in positions of political power marked a dramatic break with the country\u2019s traditions and aroused bitter hostility from Reconstruction\u2019s opponents. Serving an expanded citizenry, Reconstruction governments established the South\u2019s first state-funded public school systems, sought to strengthen the bargaining power of plantation labourers, made taxation more equitable, and outlawed racial discrimination in public transportation and accommodations. They also offered lavish aid to railroads and other enterprises in the hope of creating a \u201cNew South\u201d whose economic expansion would benefit Blacks and whites alike. But the economic program spawned corruption and rising taxes, alienating increasing numbers of white voters. Meanwhile, the social and economic transformation of the South proceeded apace. To Blacks, freedom meant independence from white control. Reconstruction provided the opportunity for African Americans to solidify their family ties and to create independent religious institutions, which became centres of community life that survived long after Reconstruction ended. The former slaves also demanded economic independence. Blacks\u2019 hopes that the federal government would provide them with land had been raised by Gen. William T. Sherman\u2019s Field Order No. 15 of January 1865, which set aside a large swath of land along the coast of South Carolina and Georgia for the exclusive settlement of Black families, and by the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act of March, which authorized the bureau to rent or sell land in its possession to former slaves. But President Johnson in the summer of 1865 ordered land in federal hands to be returned to its former owners. The dream of \u201c40 acres and a mule\u201d was stillborn. Lacking land, most former slaves had little economic alternative other than resuming work on plantations owned by whites. Some worked for wages, others as sharecroppers, who divided the crop with the owner at the end of the year. Neither status offered much hope for economic mobility. For decades, most Southern Blacks remained propertyless and poor. Nonetheless, the political revolution of Reconstruction spawned increasingly violent opposition from white Southerners.

Radical Reconstruction, process and period of Reconstruction during which the Radical Republicans in the U.S. Congress seized control of Reconstruction from Pres. Andrew Johnson and passed the Reconstruction Acts of 1867\u201368, which sent federal troops to the South to oversee the establishment of state governments that were more democratic. Congress also enacted legislation and amended the Constitution to guarantee the civil rights of freedmen and African Americans in general. In the 1866 mid-term congressional elections, voters in the North resoundingly rejected Johnson\u2019s Presidential Reconstruction policies, and Congress, dominated by Radical Republicans, decided to restart Reconstruction. The Reconstruction Acts of 1867 split the states of the former Confederacy into five military districts and specified how new governments\u2014based on manhood suffrage without regard to race\u2014were to be constituted. Thus began Radical Reconstruction, which lasted until the demise of the last Republican-led Southern governments in 1877. All of the former Confederate states had been readmitted to the Union by 1870. The Republican Party controlled the governments of almost all of them. Southern Republicanism was made up of three groups: (1) so-called carpetbaggers, recent arrivals from the North who generally were Freedmen\u2019s Bureau agents, former Union soldiers, businessmen, or teachers; so-called (2) scalawags, native-born white Republicans, who predominantly were non-slaveholding small farmers from the Southern up-country who had been loyal to the Union during the Civil War; and (3) African Americans, who formed the overwhelming majority of voters in every Southern state. African American political leaders (including individuals who had been free before the Civil War, artisans, Civil War veterans, and formerly enslaved ministers) advocated for the elimination of the racial caste system and the economic uplift of the formerly enslaved individuals. Throughout the South, more than 600 African Americans served in state legislatures, and hundreds more held local offices from sheriff to justice of the peace. Moreover, 16 African Americans served in Congress during Reconstruction, including two U.S. senators, Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce. Although the ascension of African Americans to positions of political power marked a dramatic break with the country\u2019s traditions and aroused deep-seated hostility from the opponents of Reconstruction, so-called \u201cblack supremacy\u201d never existed. Reconstruction governments served the expanding citizenry by establishing the South\u2019s first state-funded public school systems, seeking to strengthen the bargaining power of plantation labourers, making taxation more equitable, and outlawing racial discrimination in public transportation and accommodations. In the hope of creating a \u201cNew South\u201d whose economic growth would benefit both blacks and whites, the governments also made available considerable funding for railroads and other enterprises. However, those economic programs spawned corruption and rising taxes, which alienated more and more white voters. In the meantime, the South underwent a period of significant social and economic transformation. Free from white control, African Americans were able to solidify their family ties and to create independent religious institutions that would become centres of community life that survived long after the end of Reconstruction. The formerly enslaved individuals also demanded economic independence. However, in summer 1865 President Johnson had dashed African Americans\u2019 hopes that the federal government would provide them with land when he ordered that land in federal hands be returned to its former owners. Johnson\u2019s dictate invalidated Gen. William T. Sherman\u2019s Field Order No. 15 of January 1865, which had set aside land along the coast of South Carolina and Georgia for the exclusive settlement of black families. Without land, most former slaves were left with little economic alternative but to resume working on white-owned plantations. Some worked for wages, while others became sharecroppers and divided their harvest with the owner at the end of the year. Because neither pursuit offered much hope for economic mobility, for decades, most African Americans in the South remained propertyless and poor. Nonetheless, violent opposition to Reconstruction by white Southerners increased. White supremacist organizations that committed terrorist acts, such as the Ku Klux Klan, targeted local Republican leaders for beatings or assassination. African Americans who asserted their rights in dealings with whites also became targets. In 1873, scores of black militiamen were killed in Colfax, Louisiana, after surrendering to armed whites intent on seizing control of the local government.

They were led by Thaddeus Stevens in the House of Representatives and Charles Sumner in the Senate. The Radicals were known for their opposition to slavery, their efforts to ensure emancipation and civil rights for Blacks, and their strong opinions on post-war Reconstruction. They were also critical towards many policies of both President Abraham Lincoln and his successor, Andrew Johnson. Throughout the lifespan of the Radical Republican faction, they made enemies with Democrats, many former slave owners, the Ku Klux Klan, and often even found opposition from the moderate Republicans. During the Civil War, the Radical Republicans created a Joint Committee on the Conduct of War, with which they sought to investigate President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s wartime decisions and monitor the progress of the Union. The Committee worked to keep the Executive powers in check. The chairman of the Committee was Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio, who would later co-author the Radicals' plan for Reconstruction, the Wade-Davis Bill. Throughout the war, the group often criticized President Lincoln and pressured him to support their legislation. While President Lincoln wanted to fight the war largely for the preservation of the Union, the Radical Republicans believed the primary reason for fighting was for the abolition of slavery. Most of their critiques towards Lincoln were targeted at his lack of aggression in his policies, especially regarding rights for Blacks. As the end of the war drew near, the Radicals strongly disagreed with President Lincoln\u2019s proposed post-war Reconstruction plans. Whereas Lincoln wanted to peacefully recreate coexistence between the Union and the Confederate States, the Radical Republicans felt that the rebel states needed a strong hand of justice and the administration of harsh punishments for their actions. Two Radical Republicans, Senator Benjamin Wade and Representative Henry Winter Davis penned the Wade-Davis Bill in 1864, an alternative to Lincoln\u2019s Reconstruction plans. The Wade-Davis Bill called for strict conditions and punishments for the Confederate states prior to their reentry into the Union. The Radicals felt strongly that the Confederates needed to be punished for their pro-slavery views and should only be readmitted to the Union after they had abolished slavery among other conditions. They believed that government intervention in states was necessary to ensure abolition and civil rights for Blacks. However, President Lincoln vetoed their Bill, which created more hostility towards him from the Radicals. Following the end of the Civil War, the Radical Republicans took a stance against Lincoln\u2019s successor, President Andrew Johnson. They saw no effort in this new President's policies to create rights for Blacks. President Johnson would prove to be an opponent to the Radicals as they realized that he cared little about Black rights. In 1866, the tide turned in favor of the Radicals as they gained the majority of power in Congress. With this majority power, they were able to effectively push their own legislation through Congress during the era of Reconstruction. Throughout this post-war period, they fought for the eradication of slavery and civil rights for Blacks. President Johnson tried to stand as an obstacle to the goals of the Radicals and often vetoed the bills that Congress would pass. Overall, Johnson vetoed 21 bills passed by Congress, including many that were geared toward establishing rights for Blacks. However, because the Radicals controlled Congress, they successfully overruled 15 of Johnson\u2019s vetoes, including the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Reconstruction Acts of 1867. Eventually, the Radicals in the House of Representatives were successful in impeaching President Johnson, but he was acquitted in the Senate by 1 vote. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was an effort by the Radical Republicans to reinforce to the Thirteenth Amendment that abolished slavery and had been passed the year prior. With this Civil Rights Act, the radicals were also taking steps towards establishing citizenship for Blacks by defending their civil rights and granting them equal protection under the law. In 1867, they were successful in passing the Fourteenth Amendment, which granted citizenship to Blacks. The Reconstruction Acts were a renewed effort by the Radical Republicans to take control of reintegrating the previous Confederate states through harsher measures. Their previous attempt to control Reconstruction by means of the Wade-Davis Bill was vetoed by President Lincoln two years prior, but because they now had control of Congress, the Radicals pushed their agenda once more. These new Reconstruction Acts were passed and called for each rebel state to draft a new constitution as well as ratify the new Fourteenth Amendment. Congress, meaning primarily Radical Republicans, would then have to approve these new state constitutions before readmitting the rebel state back into the Union. The Reconstruction Acts also disenfranchised previous Confederate leaders and established that the new Southern leaders would only be those who supported the Union during the Civil War. Furthermore, they deployed military troops to the South to maintain order and to protect the rights of Black citizens. In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was passed, granting Blacks the right to vote. While the Radical Republicans dominated the late 1860s, their power began to dwindle\n\nquestion: What did the Reconstruction Acts of 1867 do?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Reconstruction Acts of 1867 called for each rebel state to draft a new constitution and ratify the new Fourteenth Amendment, with approval required from Congress before readmittance into the Union.", "usage": 1158}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

At that point, many political leaders believed that the era of Reconstruction was successfully completed and no longer needed Radical supervision. Some Radicals, including Charles Sumner, agreed with this idea, believing they had succeeded in their goals, and left the Radical Republican faction to join the moderates. The opposition to the Radicals became overwhelming as Democrats and moderate Republicans alike accused the Radicals of corruption and accepting bribes during the new Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. These opponents sought to undo some of the efforts made by the Radical Republicans over the past decades, including granting pardons to the disenfranchised ex-Confederates. In 1874, as their opposition grew stronger, and members deserted, the Radical Republican faction weakened and lost power in Congress. The remaining members of the faction were left to join other Republican groups, such as the Stalwarts. In the years to come, many of the Radical Republican efforts would be undone. In the corrupt election of 1876, President Rutherford B. Hayes came to power. As part of the corrupt election, Hayes agreed to remove the assigned military troops from the South and thereby end Reconstruction. The removal of the military gave white supremacists the opportunity to regain control of the South. Thus, the period of Reconstruction ended as white Democrats began instituting the Jim Crow Laws and depriving Blacks of their rights, virtually erasing significant progress that had been made by the Radical Republicans.

The Reconstruction era was the period after the American Civil War from 1865 to 1877, during which the United States grappled with the challenges of reintegrating into the Union the states that had seceded and determining the legal status of African Americans. Presidential Reconstruction, from 1865 to 1867, required little of the former Confederate states and leaders. Radical Reconstruction attempted to give African Americans full equality. The Reconstruction era redefined U.S. citizenship and expanded the franchise, changed the relationship between the federal government and the governments of the states, and highlighted the differences between political and economic democracy. While U.S. Pres. Andrew Johnson attempted to return the Southern states to essentially the condition they were in before the American Civil War, Republicans in Congress passed laws and amendments that affirmed the \u201cequality of all men before the law\u201d and prohibited racial discrimination, that made African Americans full U.S. citizens, and that forbade laws to prevent African Americans from voting. During a brief period in the Reconstruction era, African Americans voted in large numbers and held public office at almost every level, including in both houses of Congress. However, this provoked a violent backlash from whites who did not want to relinquish supremacy. The backlash succeeded, and the promises of Reconstruction were mostly unfulfilled. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were unenforced but remained on the books, forming the basis of the mid-20th-century civil rights movement. Reconstruction, in U.S. history, the period (1865\u201377) that followed the American Civil War and during which attempts were made to redress the inequities of slavery and its political, social, and economic legacy and to solve the problems arising from the readmission to the Union of the 11 states that had seceded at or before the outbreak of war. Long portrayed by many historians as a time when vindictive Radical Republicans fastened Black supremacy upon the defeated Confederacy, Reconstruction has since the late 20th century been viewed more sympathetically as a laudable experiment in interracial democracy. Reconstruction witnessed far-reaching changes in America\u2019s political life. At the national level, new laws and constitutional amendments permanently altered the federal system and the definition of American citizenship. In the South, a politically mobilized Black community joined with white allies to bring the Republican Party to power, and with it a redefinition of the responsibilities of government. The national debate over Reconstruction began during the Civil War. In December 1863, less than a year after he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Pres. Abraham Lincoln announced the first comprehensive program for Reconstruction, the Ten Percent Plan. Under it, when one-tenth of a state\u2019s prewar voters took an oath of loyalty, they could establish a new state government. To Lincoln, the plan was an attempt to weaken the Confederacy rather than a blueprint for the postwar South. It was put into operation in parts of the Union-occupied Confederacy, but none of the new governments achieved broad local support. In 1864 Congress enacted (and Lincoln pocket vetoed) the Wade-Davis Bill, which proposed to delay the formation of new Southern governments until a majority of voters had taken a loyalty oath. Some Republicans were already convinced that equal rights for the former slaves had to accompany the South\u2019s readmission to the Union. In his last speech, on April 11, 1865, Lincoln, referring to Reconstruction in Louisiana, expressed the view that some Blacks\u2014the \u201cvery intelligent\u201d and those who had served in the Union army\u2014ought to enjoy the right to vote. Following Lincoln\u2019s assassination in April 1865, Andrew Johnson became president and inaugurated the period of Presidential Reconstruction (1865\u201367). Johnson offered a pardon to all Southern whites except Confederate leaders and wealthy planters (although most of these subsequently received individual pardons), restoring their political rights and all property except slaves. He also outlined how new state governments would be created. Apart from the requirement that they abolish slavery, repudiate secession, and abrogate the Confederate debt, these governments were granted a free hand in managing their affairs.

But President Johnson in the summer of 1865 ordered land in federal hands to be returned to its former owners. The dream of \u201c40 acres and a mule\u201d was stillborn. Lacking land, most former slaves had little economic alternative other than resuming work on plantations owned by whites. Some worked for wages, others as sharecroppers, who divided the crop with the owner at the end of the year. Neither status offered much hope for economic mobility. For decades, most Southern Blacks remained propertyless and poor. Nonetheless, the political revolution of Reconstruction spawned increasingly violent opposition from white Southerners.

Radical Reconstruction, process and period of Reconstruction during which the Radical Republicans in the U.S. Congress seized control of Reconstruction from Pres. Andrew Johnson and passed the Reconstruction Acts of 1867\u201368, which sent federal troops to the South to oversee the establishment of state governments that were more democratic. Congress also enacted legislation and amended the Constitution to guarantee the civil rights of freedmen and African Americans in general. In the 1866 mid-term congressional elections, voters in the North resoundingly rejected Johnson\u2019s Presidential Reconstruction policies, and Congress, dominated by Radical Republicans, decided to restart Reconstruction. The Reconstruction Acts of 1867 split the states of the former Confederacy into five military districts and specified how new governments\u2014based on manhood suffrage without regard to race\u2014were to be constituted. Thus began Radical Reconstruction, which lasted until the demise of the last Republican-led Southern governments in 1877. All of the former Confederate states had been readmitted to the Union by 1870. The Republican Party controlled the governments of almost all of them. Southern Republicanism was made up of three groups: (1) so-called carpetbaggers, recent arrivals from the North who generally were Freedmen\u2019s Bureau agents, former Union soldiers, businessmen, or teachers; so-called (2) scalawags, native-born white Republicans, who predominantly were non-slaveholding small farmers from the Southern up-country who had been loyal to the Union during the Civil War; and (3) African Americans, who formed the overwhelming majority of voters in every Southern state. African American political leaders (including individuals who had been free before the Civil War, artisans, Civil War veterans, and formerly enslaved ministers) advocated for the elimination of the racial caste system and the economic uplift of the formerly enslaved individuals. Throughout the South, more than 600 African Americans served in state legislatures, and hundreds more held local offices from sheriff to justice of the peace. Moreover, 16 African Americans served in Congress during Reconstruction, including two U.S. senators, Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce. Although the ascension of African Americans to positions of political power marked a dramatic break with the country\u2019s traditions and aroused deep-seated hostility from the opponents of Reconstruction, so-called \u201cblack supremacy\u201d never existed. Reconstruction governments served the expanding citizenry by establishing the South\u2019s first state-funded public school systems, seeking to strengthen the bargaining power of plantation labourers, making taxation more equitable, and outlawing racial discrimination in public transportation and accommodations. In the hope of creating a \u201cNew South\u201d whose economic growth would benefit both blacks and whites, the governments also made available considerable funding for railroads and other enterprises. However, those economic programs spawned corruption and rising taxes, which alienated more and more white voters. In the meantime, the South underwent a period of significant social and economic transformation. Free from white control, African Americans were able to solidify their family ties and to create independent religious institutions that would become centres of community life that survived long after the end of Reconstruction. The formerly enslaved individuals also demanded economic independence. However, in summer 1865 President Johnson had dashed African Americans\u2019 hopes that the federal government would provide them with land when he ordered that land in federal hands be returned to its former owners. Johnson\u2019s dictate invalidated Gen. William T. Sherman\u2019s Field Order No. 15 of January 1865, which had set aside land along the coast of South Carolina and Georgia for the exclusive settlement of black families. Without land, most former slaves were left with little economic alternative but to resume working on white-owned plantations. Some worked for wages, while others became sharecroppers and divided their harvest with the owner at the end of the year. Because neither pursuit offered much hope for economic mobility, for decades, most African Americans in the South remained propertyless and poor. Nonetheless, violent opposition to Reconstruction by white Southerners increased. White supremacist organizations that committed terrorist acts, such as the Ku Klux Klan, targeted local Republican leaders for beatings or assassination. African Americans who asserted their rights in dealings with whites also became targets. In 1873, scores of black militiamen were killed in Colfax, Louisiana, after surrendering to armed whites intent on seizing control of the local government. Increasingly, the new Southern governments looked to Washington, D.C., for assistance. With Republican Ulysses S. Grant having been elected president in fall 1868, by the next year the Republican Party was firmly in control of all three branches of the federal government.

They were led by Thaddeus Stevens in the House of Representatives and Charles Sumner in the Senate. The Radicals were known for their opposition to slavery, their efforts to ensure emancipation and civil rights for Blacks, and their strong opinions on post-war Reconstruction. They were also critical towards many policies of both President Abraham Lincoln and his successor, Andrew Johnson. Throughout the lifespan of the Radical Republican faction, they made enemies with Democrats, many former slave owners, the Ku Klux Klan, and often even found opposition from the moderate Republicans. During the Civil War, the Radical Republicans created a Joint Committee on the Conduct of War, with which they sought to investigate President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s wartime decisions and monitor the progress of the Union. The Committee worked to keep the Executive powers in check. The chairman of the Committee was Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio, who would later co-author the Radicals' plan for Reconstruction, the Wade-Davis Bill. Throughout the war, the group often criticized President Lincoln and pressured him to support their legislation. While President Lincoln wanted to fight the war largely for the preservation of the Union, the Radical Republicans believed the primary reason for fighting was for the abolition of slavery. Most of their critiques towards Lincoln were targeted at his lack of aggression in his policies, especially regarding rights for Blacks. As the end of the war drew near, the Radicals strongly disagreed with President Lincoln\u2019s proposed post-war Reconstruction plans. Whereas Lincoln wanted to peacefully recreate coexistence between the Union and the Confederate States, the Radical Republicans felt that the rebel states needed a strong hand of justice and the administration of harsh punishments for their actions. Two Radical Republicans, Senator Benjamin Wade and Representative Henry Winter Davis penned the Wade-Davis Bill in 1864, an alternative to Lincoln\u2019s Reconstruction plans. The Wade-Davis Bill called for strict conditions and punishments for the Confederate states prior to their reentry into the Union. The Radicals felt strongly that the Confederates needed to be punished for their pro-slavery views and should only be readmitted to the Union after they had abolished slavery among other conditions. They believed that government intervention in states was necessary to ensure abolition and civil rights for Blacks. However, President Lincoln vetoed their Bill, which created more hostility towards him from the Radicals. Following the end of the Civil War, the Radical Republicans took a stance against Lincoln\u2019s successor, President Andrew Johnson. They saw no effort in this new President's policies to create rights for Blacks. President Johnson would prove to be an opponent to the Radicals as they realized that he cared little about Black rights. In 1866, the tide turned in favor of the Radicals as they gained the majority of power in Congress. With this majority power, they were able to effectively push their own legislation through Congress during the era of Reconstruction. Throughout this post-war period, they fought for the eradication of slavery and civil rights for Blacks. President Johnson tried to stand as an obstacle to the goals of the Radicals and often vetoed the bills that Congress would pass. Overall, Johnson vetoed 21 bills passed by Congress, including many that were geared toward establishing rights for Blacks. However, because the Radicals controlled Congress, they successfully overruled 15 of Johnson\u2019s vetoes, including the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Reconstruction Acts of 1867. Eventually, the Radicals in the House of Representatives were successful in impeaching President Johnson, but he was acquitted in the Senate by 1 vote. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was an effort by the Radical Republicans to reinforce to the Thirteenth Amendment that abolished slavery and had been passed the year prior. With this Civil Rights Act, the radicals were also taking steps towards establishing citizenship for Blacks by defending their civil rights and granting them equal protection under the law. In 1867, they were successful in passing the Fourteenth Amendment, which granted citizenship to Blacks. The Reconstruction Acts were a renewed effort by the Radical Republicans to take control of reintegrating the previous Confederate states through harsher measures. Their previous attempt to control Reconstruction by means of the Wade-Davis Bill was vetoed by President Lincoln two years prior, but because they now had control of Congress, the Radicals pushed their agenda once more. These new Reconstruction Acts were passed and called for each rebel state to draft a new constitution as well as ratify the new Fourteenth Amendment. Congress, meaning primarily Radical Republicans, would then have to approve these new state constitutions before readmitting the rebel state back into the Union. The Reconstruction Acts also disenfranchised previous Confederate leaders and established that the new Southern leaders would only be those who supported the Union during the Civil War. Furthermore, they deployed military troops to the South to maintain order and to protect the rights of Black citizens. In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was passed, granting Blacks the right to vote. While the Radical Republicans dominated the late 1860s, their power began to dwindle\n\nquestion: What did Northern voters do in the 1866 mid-term congressional elections?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "They voted in favor of Radical Republicans who dominated the late 1860s.", "usage": 1139}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

At that point, many political leaders believed that the era of Reconstruction was successfully completed and no longer needed Radical supervision. Some Radicals, including Charles Sumner, agreed with this idea, believing they had succeeded in their goals, and left the Radical Republican faction to join the moderates. The opposition to the Radicals became overwhelming as Democrats and moderate Republicans alike accused the Radicals of corruption and accepting bribes during the new Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. These opponents sought to undo some of the efforts made by the Radical Republicans over the past decades, including granting pardons to the disenfranchised ex-Confederates. In 1874, as their opposition grew stronger, and members deserted, the Radical Republican faction weakened and lost power in Congress. The remaining members of the faction were left to join other Republican groups, such as the Stalwarts. In the years to come, many of the Radical Republican efforts would be undone. In the corrupt election of 1876, President Rutherford B. Hayes came to power. As part of the corrupt election, Hayes agreed to remove the assigned military troops from the South and thereby end Reconstruction. The removal of the military gave white supremacists the opportunity to regain control of the South. Thus, the period of Reconstruction ended as white Democrats began instituting the Jim Crow Laws and depriving Blacks of their rights, virtually erasing significant progress that had been made by the Radical Republicans.
