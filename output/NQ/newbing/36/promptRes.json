Halep, who had lost her three previous major finals, went a set and a break down at Roland Garros. But the 26-year-old Romanian battled back to take a see-saw second set against the US Open champion. She then raced away with the third to win 3-6 6-4 6-1. \"I did everything I could. It is amazing what is happening now,\" Halep said. \"I have been dreaming for this moment since I started playing tennis.\" Halep clinched victory with her first match point, Stephens unable to return a powerful first serve. The top seed dropped her racquet in celebration, covering her face with both hands before Stephens walked around the net to warmly hug the champion. Given a standing ovation by the Court Philippe Chatrier crowd, a tearful Halep climbed into the stand behind the baseline to celebrate with her family and coaching team. Halep had lost in two previous French Open finals - to Maria Sharapova in 2014 and Jelena Ostapenko in 2017 - and against Caroline Wozniacki in this year's Australian Open showpiece. The world number one said in the build-up to this match that she felt relaxed and would not be fazed by the pressure of winning her first Slam. And so it proved as she delivered in front of an expectant crowd. Halep was the favourite to finally land her first major title against an opponent who is better known for her success on hard courts rather than clay. But she was beaten by Stephens' brilliance, not herself, in the opening set. After that Halep took control, winning four games in a row early in the second as momentum turned. An early break in the third set, with Stephens appearing to tire, put the Romanian in command. Backed by plenty of noisy Romanian support, Halep broke again for 4-0 after an astonishing point in which she wore Stephens down with her relentless returning. She raced through a hold to love and, after taking Stephens to deuce, served out to win her first Grand Slam at the 33rd attempt. Stephens' run to her second Grand Slam final came as a surprise to many, given she had never previously made it past the fourth round at Roland Garros. The 25-year-old American had won all but one of her six Tour titles - including last year's US Open victory - on a hard court. But her performances here are further proof she is ready to challenge regularly for more honours. She will now rise to fourth in the world rankings after dropping to 957th just six weeks before her Flushing Meadows victory, following a foot injury which kept her out for almost a year. Stephens breezed through the French Open draw, dropping only one set, though she did not face anybody seeded higher until she met Halep. Many experts predicted a baseline battle in the final - and that is how it turned out. In the opening set, Stephens' sharp movement across the baseline enabled her to return everything Halep threw at her, while forcing the Romanian into errors and hitting some wonderful winners herself. However, she could not replicate the same intensity in the second. Stephens coughed up the first double fault of the match for 0-30 in the fourth game, in the middle of that momentum shift towards Halep, and from there the signs were ominous. \"It's not the trophy I wanted but it is still beautiful,\" Stephens said. \"Congratulations to Simona. There is no-one else I'd rather lose to than the number one in the world.\" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Stephens played a first set of staggering quality, and not even the world number one, on her favourite court, could find the answers. There was no warning of the change of momentum two games into the second set, but Halep started serving more consistently and after edging a tight second set, built up an unstoppable head of steam. The Romanian says she is more relaxed, and more fatalistic, this year - and it certainly showed on court. Halep refused to panic, and slowly and surely Stephens started to lose heart. Three narrow misses in Grand Slam finals - and her response to the setbacks - have endeared Halep to fans all around the world. In victory she has emulated Chris Evert, who also lost her first three Grand Slam finals before breaking her duck here at Roland Garros. These comments are now closed.

They were contrasting victories for the players who share much in common. Wozniacki won her first grand slam title Saturday when she beat Simona Halep 7-6 (7-2) 3-6 6-4 in an eventful, absorbing Australian Open final that lasted nearly three hours in the draining Melbourne heat. Indeed the heat rule was implemented for the first time during the fortnight despite higher temperatures in week one. Both players took medical timeouts and a pair of games lasted longer than 10 minutes as the athleticism of the world\u2019s two highest-ranked players was on show at Rod Laver Arena. Billed as a blockbuster battle in the buildup, no one would dare say it disappointed. The Dane admitted she was a \u201cnervous wreck\u201d hours before the encounter but now she will be forever labeled a grand slam winner instead of a player who held down the top ranking without landing the big one. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the most positive things about all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m never going to get that question again. I\u2019m just waiting for the question, \u2018When are you going to win the second one?\u2019 \u201cRight now I\u2019m just happy I have this one, and I\u2019m going to really enjoy this moment.\u201d She will enjoy replacing Halep as the world No. 1, too, when the rankings are released Monday, six years after she was last atop the summit. Wozniacki flung her racket into the air and sank to the court when Halep sent a backhand into the net and there were tears from the 27-year-old as she walked to the net to shake hands with the unfortunate Halep. She is her country\u2019s first grand slam singles champion. She soon thanked those in her box, including new fiance David Lee \u2013 a former NBA all-star \u2013 and dad Piotr, who has been an ever present on tour with his daughter. \u201cMy voice is shaking,\u201d said Wozniacki as she hoisted the winners\u2019 trophy. \u201cI never cry but this is an emotional moment. \u201cI was a nervous wreck this morning because I wanted to win so bad. \u201cI dreamed of this moment for so many years and to be here today is a dream come true,\u201d added Wozniacki, who passed $30 million in prize money in her career. \"I've dreamed of this moment for so many years. Today is a dream come true. I'm shaking right now. I'm going to cry.\"-@CaroWozniacki \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude2d#AusOpen pic.twitter.com/jOwGbSaEzt One of her good pals, tennis legend Serena Williams, was quick to congratulate her. I got too nervous to watch but woke up to @CaroWozniacki new number one and aussie open champ. So awesome. So happy. Are those tears? Yup they are. \ud83d\ude2d from a year ago to today I'm so proud my friend so proud. Literally can't even sleep now Like Wozniacki, Halep contested a third grand slam final and desperately hoped to become Romania\u2019s second female grand slam winner following her manager, Virginia Ruzici. But her wait continues. When she led by a break at 4-3 in the third, she was almost there. But having led for the first time in the contest, the dynamic suddenly changed. Now the front runner, Halep waned ever so slightly and it was all Wozniacki needed. The exertions of Halep\u2019s long fortnight had taken a toll. All three of Halep\u2019s defeats in grand slam finals have come in three agonizing sets. \u201cI can still smile,\u201d Halep told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I cried, but now I\u2019m smiling. Is just a tennis match in the end. But I\u2019m really sad I couldn\u2019t win it. I was close again but the gas was over in the end. \u201cShe was better. She was fresher. She had actually more energy in the end.\u201d One could argue that both players had destiny on their side in Melbourne, since they saved match points en route to the final. Wozniacki was the first, fending off two against unseeded Croatian Jana Fett in the second round when she trailed 5-1 in a third set.\n\nquestion: Who won their first Grand Slam title at the French Open in 2018?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1072}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

READ: Halep saves match points again In the end, the tennis gods sided with Wozniacki. She was flawless at the start, clean yet also aggressive, building a 5-2 lead. Serving for the set at 5-3 proved a pressure moment and Wozniacki made a pair of key unforced errors, missing a backhand volley and forehand long. She recovered in the tiebreak in brilliant fashion, striking two winners and forcing Halep into four errors. Halep took her medical timeout at 3-2 in the second set, having her blood pressure checked after feeling dizzy. This after rolling her left ankle in the first round. It did little to stop her, though, as she became even more aggressive. Cramps to her left leg were setting in and Halep later said she would need MRIs to both feet. Overall Halep registered 40 winners and 47 unforced errors, while Wozniacki struck 25 winners and 28 unforced errors. They were fine numbers for the duo considering the heat and their brilliant movement. Halep forced a decider and the 10-minute break between the second and third sets through the heat rule \u2013 the final began in temperatures of around 32 degrees Celsius \u2013 was a boost for the 26-year-old though one could argue her momentum was halted. Wozniacki led 3-1 in the third set, only to lose the next three games as the breaks piled up. That\u2019s when Wozniacki called her medical timeout for a left knee issue. Wozniacki held for 5-4 \u2013 it was a rare, quick hold \u2013 to put enormous pressure on Halep and at 30-15, the world No. 1 contributed a double fault. It was her only one of the match. Congratulations to both @CaroWozniacki and @Simona_Halep for gutsy performances tonight and welcome to the Major Winner Club,Caro:), and #1 again!!! https://t.co/LiGWkHNgzA If she donated that point to Wozniacki, it wasn\u2019t the case on the next one. Wozniacki ripped a backhand cross-court from outside the tram lines to bring up match point. \u201cThat was a crazy point,\u201d said Wozniacki. You\u2019d be hard pressed to decide who has the better backhand. They are both stellar. But on the final point Halep\u2019s sailed into the net as Wozniacki got every ball back. \u201cI was really tired,\u201d said Halep. \u201cI had so many problems at my feet, pain everywhere. But I think I did pretty well with all the things that were going on. After the first set, I just was out. I don\u2019t know what happened. No energy, no power. But then I just said that I have to hit all the balls, and then I could take the second set. \u201cI came back in the third set, but when I had to serve for 5-3, the gas was gone.\u201d Who will the men\u2019s final at the Australian Open?

They were contrasting victories for the players who share much in common. Wozniacki won her first grand slam title Saturday when she beat Simona Halep 7-6 (7-2) 3-6 6-4 in an eventful, absorbing Australian Open final that lasted nearly three hours in the draining Melbourne heat. Indeed the heat rule was implemented for the first time during the fortnight despite higher temperatures in week one. Both players took medical timeouts and a pair of games lasted longer than 10 minutes as the athleticism of the world\u2019s two highest-ranked players was on show at Rod Laver Arena. Billed as a blockbuster battle in the buildup, no one would dare say it disappointed. The Dane admitted she was a \u201cnervous wreck\u201d hours before the encounter but now she will be forever labeled a grand slam winner instead of a player who held down the top ranking without landing the big one. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the most positive things about all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m never going to get that question again. I\u2019m just waiting for the question, \u2018When are you going to win the second one?\u2019 \u201cRight now I\u2019m just happy I have this one, and I\u2019m going to really enjoy this moment.\u201d She will enjoy replacing Halep as the world No. 1, too, when the rankings are released Monday, six years after she was last atop the summit. Wozniacki flung her racket into the air and sank to the court when Halep sent a backhand into the net and there were tears from the 27-year-old as she walked to the net to shake hands with the unfortunate Halep. She is her country\u2019s first grand slam singles champion. She soon thanked those in her box, including new fiance David Lee \u2013 a former NBA all-star \u2013 and dad Piotr, who has been an ever present on tour with his daughter. \u201cMy voice is shaking,\u201d said Wozniacki as she hoisted the winners\u2019 trophy. \u201cI never cry but this is an emotional moment. \u201cI was a nervous wreck this morning because I wanted to win so bad. \u201cI dreamed of this moment for so many years and to be here today is a dream come true,\u201d added Wozniacki, who passed $30 million in prize money in her career. \"I've dreamed of this moment for so many years.

Yup they are. \ud83d\ude2d from a year ago to today I'm so proud my friend so proud. Literally can't even sleep now Like Wozniacki, Halep contested a third grand slam final and desperately hoped to become Romania\u2019s second female grand slam winner following her manager, Virginia Ruzici. But her wait continues. When she led by a break at 4-3 in the third, she was almost there. But having led for the first time in the contest, the dynamic suddenly changed. Now the front runner, Halep waned ever so slightly and it was all Wozniacki needed. The exertions of Halep\u2019s long fortnight had taken a toll. All three of Halep\u2019s defeats in grand slam finals have come in three agonizing sets. \u201cI can still smile,\u201d Halep told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I cried, but now I\u2019m smiling. Is just a tennis match in the end. But I\u2019m really sad I couldn\u2019t win it. I was close again but the gas was over in the end. \u201cShe was better. She was fresher. She had actually more energy in the end.\u201d One could argue that both players had destiny on their side in Melbourne, since they saved match points en route to the final. Wozniacki was the first, fending off two against unseeded Croatian Jana Fett in the second round when she trailed 5-1 in a third set.\n\nquestion: Who did Simona Halep have a comeback victory over at the French Open?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1072}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

READ: Halep saves match points again In the end, the tennis gods sided with Wozniacki. She was flawless at the start, clean yet also aggressive, building a 5-2 lead. Serving for the set at 5-3 proved a pressure moment and Wozniacki made a pair of key unforced errors, missing a backhand volley and forehand long. She recovered in the tiebreak in brilliant fashion, striking two winners and forcing Halep into four errors. Halep took her medical timeout at 3-2 in the second set, having her blood pressure checked after feeling dizzy. This after rolling her left ankle in the first round. It did little to stop her, though, as she became even more aggressive. Cramps to her left leg were setting in and Halep later said she would need MRIs to both feet. Overall Halep registered 40 winners and 47 unforced errors, while Wozniacki struck 25 winners and 28 unforced errors. They were fine numbers for the duo considering the heat and their brilliant movement. Halep forced a decider and the 10-minute break between the second and third sets through the heat rule \u2013 the final began in temperatures of around 32 degrees Celsius \u2013 was a boost for the 26-year-old though one could argue her momentum was halted. Wozniacki led 3-1 in the third set, only to lose the next three games as the breaks piled up. That\u2019s when Wozniacki called her medical timeout for a left knee issue. Wozniacki held for 5-4 \u2013 it was a rare, quick hold \u2013 to put enormous pressure on Halep and at 30-15, the world No. 1 contributed a double fault. It was her only one of the match.

But on the final point Halep\u2019s sailed into the net as Wozniacki got every ball back. \u201cI was really tired,\u201d said Halep. \u201cI had so many problems at my feet, pain everywhere. But I think I did pretty well with all the things that were going on. After the first set, I just was out. I don\u2019t know what happened. No energy, no power.

Halep, who had lost her three previous major finals, went a set and a break down at Roland Garros. But the 26-year-old Romanian battled back to take a see-saw second set against the US Open champion. She then raced away with the third to win 3-6 6-4 6-1. \"I did everything I could. It is amazing what is happening now,\" Halep said. \"I have been dreaming for this moment since I started playing tennis.\" Halep clinched victory with her first match point, Stephens unable to return a powerful first serve. The top seed dropped her racquet in celebration, covering her face with both hands before Stephens walked around the net to warmly hug the champion. Given a standing ovation by the Court Philippe Chatrier crowd, a tearful Halep climbed into the stand behind the baseline to celebrate with her family and coaching team. Halep had lost in two previous French Open finals - to Maria Sharapova in 2014 and Jelena Ostapenko in 2017 - and against Caroline Wozniacki in this year's Australian Open showpiece. The world number one said in the build-up to this match that she felt relaxed and would not be fazed by the pressure of winning her first Slam. And so it proved as she delivered in front of an expectant crowd. Halep was the favourite to finally land her first major title against an opponent who is better known for her success on hard courts rather than clay. But she was beaten by Stephens' brilliance, not herself, in the opening set. After that Halep took control, winning four games in a row early in the second as momentum turned. An early break in the third set, with Stephens appearing to tire, put the Romanian in command. Backed by plenty of noisy Romanian support, Halep broke again for 4-0 after an astonishing point in which she wore Stephens down with her relentless returning. She raced through a hold to love and, after taking Stephens to deuce, served out to win her first Grand Slam at the 33rd attempt. Stephens' run to her second Grand Slam final came as a surprise to many, given she had never previously made it past the fourth round at Roland Garros. The 25-year-old American had won all but one of her six Tour titles - including last year's US Open victory - on a hard court. But her performances here are further proof she is ready to challenge regularly for more honours. She will now rise to fourth in the world rankings after dropping to 957th just six weeks before her Flushing Meadows victory, following a foot injury which kept her out for almost a year. Stephens breezed through the French Open draw, dropping only one set, though she did not face anybody seeded higher until she met Halep. Many experts predicted a baseline battle in the final - and that is how it turned out. In the opening set, Stephens' sharp movement across the baseline enabled her to return everything Halep threw at her, while forcing the Romanian into errors and hitting some wonderful winners herself. However, she could not replicate the same intensity in the second. Stephens coughed up the first double fault of the match for 0-30 in the fourth game, in the middle of that momentum shift towards Halep, and from there the signs were ominous. \"It's not the trophy I wanted but it is still beautiful,\" Stephens said. \"Congratulations to Simona. There is no-one else I'd rather lose to than the number one in the world.\" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Stephens played a first set of staggering quality, and not even the world number one, on her favourite court, could find the answers. There was no warning of the change of momentum two games into the second set, but Halep started serving more consistently and after edging a tight second set, built up an unstoppable head of steam. The Romanian says she is more relaxed, and more fatalistic, this year - and it certainly showed on court. Halep refused to panic, and slowly and surely Stephens started to lose heart. Three narrow misses in Grand Slam finals - and her response to the setbacks - have endeared Halep to fans all around the world. In victory she has emulated Chris Evert, who also lost her first three Grand Slam finals before breaking her duck here at Roland Garros. These comments are now closed.

Stephens coughed up the first double fault of the match for 0-30 in the fourth game, in the middle of that momentum shift towards Halep, and from there the signs were ominous. \"It's not the trophy I wanted but it is still beautiful,\" Stephens said. \"Congratulations to Simona. There is no-one else I'd rather lose to than the number one in the world.\" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Stephens played a first set of staggering quality, and not even the world number one, on her favourite court, could find the answers. There was no warning of the change of momentum two games into the second set, but Halep started serving more consistently and after edging a tight second set, built up an unstoppable head of steam. The Romanian says she is more relaxed, and more fatalistic, this year - and it certainly showed on court. Halep refused to panic, and slowly and surely Stephens started to lose heart. Three narrow misses in Grand Slam finals - and her response to the setbacks - have endeared Halep to fans all around the world. In victory she has emulated Chris Evert, who also lost her first three Grand Slam finals before breaking her duck here at Roland Garros. These comments are now closed.

They were contrasting victories for the players who share much in common. Wozniacki won her first grand slam title Saturday when she beat Simona Halep 7-6 (7-2) 3-6 6-4 in an eventful, absorbing Australian Open final that lasted nearly three hours in the draining Melbourne heat. Indeed the heat rule was implemented for the first time during the fortnight despite higher temperatures in week one. Both players took medical timeouts and a pair of games lasted longer than 10 minutes as the athleticism of the world\u2019s two highest-ranked players was on show at Rod Laver Arena. Billed as a blockbuster battle in the buildup, no one would dare say it disappointed. The Dane admitted she was a \u201cnervous wreck\u201d hours before the encounter but now she will be forever labeled a grand slam winner instead of a player who held down the top ranking without landing the big one. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the most positive things about all of this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m never going to get that question again. I\u2019m just waiting for the question, \u2018When are you going to win the second one?\u2019 \u201cRight now I\u2019m just happy I have this one, and I\u2019m going to really enjoy this moment.\u201d She will enjoy replacing Halep as the world No. 1, too, when the rankings are released Monday, six years after she was last atop the summit. Wozniacki flung her racket into the air and sank to the court when Halep sent a backhand into the net and there were tears from the 27-year-old as she walked to the net to shake hands with the unfortunate Halep. She is her country\u2019s first grand slam singles champion. She soon thanked those in her box, including new fiance David Lee \u2013 a former NBA all-star \u2013 and dad Piotr, who has been an ever present on tour with his daughter. \u201cMy voice is shaking,\u201d said Wozniacki as she hoisted the winners\u2019 trophy. \u201cI never cry but this is an emotional moment. \u201cI was a nervous wreck this morning because I wanted to win so bad. \u201cI dreamed of this moment for so many years and to be here today is a dream come true,\u201d added Wozniacki, who passed $30 million in prize money in her career. \"I've dreamed of this moment for so many years. Today is a dream come true. I'm shaking right now. I'm going to cry.\"-@CaroWozniacki \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude2d#AusOpen pic.twitter.com/jOwGbSaEzt One of her good pals, tennis legend Serena Williams, was quick to congratulate her. I got too nervous to watch but woke up to @CaroWozniacki new number one and aussie open champ. So awesome. So happy. Are those tears? Yup they are. \ud83d\ude2d from a year ago to today I'm so proud my friend so proud. Literally can't even sleep now Like Wozniacki, Halep contested a third grand slam final and desperately hoped to become Romania\u2019s second female grand slam winner following her manager, Virginia Ruzici. But her wait continues. When she led by a break at 4-3 in the third, she was almost there. But having led for the first time in the contest, the dynamic suddenly changed. Now the front runner, Halep waned ever so slightly and it was all Wozniacki needed. The exertions of Halep\u2019s long fortnight had taken a toll. All three of Halep\u2019s defeats in grand slam finals have come in three agonizing sets. \u201cI can still smile,\u201d Halep told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I cried, but now I\u2019m smiling. Is just a tennis match in the end. But I\u2019m really sad I couldn\u2019t win it. I was close again but the gas was over in the end. \u201cShe was better. She was fresher. She had actually more energy in the end.\u201d One could argue that both players had destiny on their side in Melbourne, since they saved match points en route to the final. Wozniacki was the first, fending off two against unseeded Croatian Jana Fett in the second round when she trailed 5-1 in a third set.\n\nquestion: Who did Caroline Wozniacki beat to win her first Grand Slam title in 2018?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Simona Halep", "usage": 1079}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

READ: Halep saves match points again In the end, the tennis gods sided with Wozniacki. She was flawless at the start, clean yet also aggressive, building a 5-2 lead. Serving for the set at 5-3 proved a pressure moment and Wozniacki made a pair of key unforced errors, missing a backhand volley and forehand long. She recovered in the tiebreak in brilliant fashion, striking two winners and forcing Halep into four errors. Halep took her medical timeout at 3-2 in the second set, having her blood pressure checked after feeling dizzy. This after rolling her left ankle in the first round. It did little to stop her, though, as she became even more aggressive. Cramps to her left leg were setting in and Halep later said she would need MRIs to both feet. Overall Halep registered 40 winners and 47 unforced errors, while Wozniacki struck 25 winners and 28 unforced errors. They were fine numbers for the duo considering the heat and their brilliant movement. Halep forced a decider and the 10-minute break between the second and third sets through the heat rule \u2013 the final began in temperatures of around 32 degrees Celsius \u2013 was a boost for the 26-year-old though one could argue her momentum was halted. Wozniacki led 3-1 in the third set, only to lose the next three games as the breaks piled up. That\u2019s when Wozniacki called her medical timeout for a left knee issue. Wozniacki held for 5-4 \u2013 it was a rare, quick hold \u2013 to put enormous pressure on Halep and at 30-15, the world No. 1 contributed a double fault. It was her only one of the match. Congratulations to both @CaroWozniacki and @Simona_Halep for gutsy performances tonight and welcome to the Major Winner Club,Caro:), and #1 again!!! https://t.co/LiGWkHNgzA If she donated that point to Wozniacki, it wasn\u2019t the case on the next one. Wozniacki ripped a backhand cross-court from outside the tram lines to bring up match point. \u201cThat was a crazy point,\u201d said Wozniacki. You\u2019d be hard pressed to decide who has the better backhand. They are both stellar. But on the final point Halep\u2019s sailed into the net as Wozniacki got every ball back. \u201cI was really tired,\u201d said Halep. \u201cI had so many problems at my feet, pain everywhere. But I think I did pretty well with all the things that were going on. After the first set, I just was out. I don\u2019t know what happened. No energy, no power. But then I just said that I have to hit all the balls, and then I could take the second set. \u201cI came back in the third set, but when I had to serve for 5-3, the gas was gone.\u201d Who will the men\u2019s final at the Australian Open?
