It was written in 1975, the same year that Deacon married his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff, and accordingly, it is dedicated to her. It is also interesting to note that as of now, over 4 decades years later, John and Veronica are still married. And as evident from this song, his love for her was very much present from the start. For instance, he defines her as being the personification of all the world has to offer to him. In fact she is the one who actually gives him life. And even when he wanders astray, he has to come back to her, not only for the joy he experiences in her company but also because she is the one who has stood with him through thick and thin. In fact when life seems unfavorable to John, Veronica is the first one to show her support. Another notable characteristic that the subject of this song possesses is her ability to make the world in general seem like a better place to the singer. And all of this ultimately boils down to him coming to the conclusion that she is his \u201cbest friend\u201d and in fact has become an invaluable part of his earthly existence. This is the fourth song on the first side of Queen\u2019s 1975 album \u201cA Night at the Opera\u201d, which was their fourth studio album overall. Additional Queen albums this song is featured on are: Live Killers (1979) and Greatest Hits (1981). Furthermore, the song was also featured Queen\u2019s 2009 compilation album titled Absolute Greatest (2009). In 2014, it once again was featured in another compilation album by the band titled Queen Forever. Beautiful song. I love that Queen got all light and poppy for this one. So sweet that Deacy found true love with Veronica, wrote the song and learned to play electric piano to record the song Your email address will not be published.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"You're My Best Friend\": A Song Dedicated to Love and Admiration\n\nevidence: One of the most-played tracks on American radio, \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 was penned by John Deacon and remains one of Queen\u2019s most emotional songs. Published on By Picking a follow-up to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d which quickly became one of the best-selling singles of all time after its release, on October 31, 1975, would have been a challenge for any band. Queen, however, had the answer: a catchy love song written by their bass player, John Deacon, and which was given the name \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend.\u201d Deacon penned just the one song for A Night At The Opera, Queen\u2019s fourth studio album. \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d was written about his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff, a former trainee teacher from Sheffield, and turned out to be an enduring hit. The song expressed his devotion in heartfelt lyrics: \u201cYou\u2019re my sunshine and I want you to know/That my feelings are true/I really love you/Oh, you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d Singer Freddie Mercury said he always liked \u201cthe almost Tamla Motown style of Deacon\u2019s songs.\u201d The band\u2019s bassist wrote the song at home. \u201cFreddie didn\u2019t like the electric piano, so I took it home and I started to learn on the electric piano and basically that\u2019s the song that came out when I was learning to play piano,\u201d said Deacon. \u201cIt was written on that instrument and it sounds best on that.\u201d Watch this video on YouTube The song, featuring clever arrangements which displayed the brilliant harmonizing of the band, was recorded in August 1975 in London. Roger Taylor\u2019s deft drumming, with bass, snare, and hi-hat, combined well with Deacon\u2019s Fender bass. Deacon also played the Wurlitzer EP-200 electric piano on the track, while Brian May worked his usual magic with five different guitar tracks on his famous Red Special. \u201cJohn didn\u2019t write that many songs but when he did \u2013 as with \u2018Another One Bites the Dust\u2019 and \u2018I Want To Break Free\u2019 \u2013 they were big, big hits,\u201d said May. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 became one of the most-played tracks on American radio. John was a dark horse, generally the quiet guy in Queen. We would ask him sometimes, \u2018Have you got anything, John?\u2019 and he was very self-effacing about what he had written. \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 was about his lovely lady wife.\u201d The success of the \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d video persuaded the band to use that promotional tool again. The clip for \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d \u2013 which shows the band in a huge ballroom, with a glittering chandelier, surrounded by more than a thousand candles \u2013 was directed by Bruce Gowers. It was shot at Elstree Studios in London during an unseasonably warm spring day. There was no air conditioning and the heat from the candles and lights made for an uncomfortable session. For the video, Deacon played a grand piano, the same instrument Mercury used when the song was performed in concert. \u201cI refused to play that damn thing,\u201d Mercury said of the electric piano. \u201cIt\u2019s tiny and horrible and I don\u2019t like them. Why play those when you have a lovely superb piano?\u201d The three-minute single was released on June 10, 1976, in the United States, and frequent radio plays helped it become a hit. \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d began an eight-week run in the UK singles charts on July 3, reaching a peak position of No.7. It also reached No.16 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was later certified platinum in America, with more than one million copies sold. Coincidentally, country singer Don Williams had a hit with his own song titled \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d later that year. Queen\u2019s song has featured in numerous films and television shows, including The Simpsons, Family Guy, and EastEnders. Deacon\u2019s sweet ballad, which also played at the end of the zombie-movie parody Shaun Of The Dead, has also been covered by other artists, including The Supernaturals (1997) and Stevie Ann (2014). When Queen released their album Live Killers in 1979, comprising performances of songs from concerts around Europe, they included a neat two-minute version of \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend.\u201d Decades on from the chart success of \u201cYou\u2019\n\nquestion: Who wrote the song 'You're My Best Friend'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "John Deacon", "usage": 1018}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The song brought Williams his second No. 1 hit, as it ranked atop Billboard\u2019s Hot Country Songs chart and marked Williams\u2019 true beginning as a commercial juggernaut, as the song topped Canadian RPM Country Tracks. It even cracked the U.K. Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 35. It has since become one of his signature tunes and paved the way for several songs by Don Williams to enter the country charts. Written by songwriter Wayland Holyfield, \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d is a simple, genuine sentiment of love and friendship to a long-term romantic partner. \u201cYou\u2019re my bread when I\u2019m hungry. You\u2019re my shelter from troubled winds. You\u2019re my anchor in life\u2019s ocean. But most of all, you\u2019re my best friend,\u201d the song goes. Holyfield was actually just new in the songwriting business when he penned this song about his wife, but he knew it would resonate with every person who is in that type of special relationship. Indeed, it was! The moment Don Williams began singing the romantic ballad in his shows, he noticed how the audiences had already picked up all the lyrics. It then quickly grew into a major sing-along segment of his live shows. The song also marked a long and fruitful partnership between Williams and Holyfield. \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d was actually Holyfield\u2019s first No. 1 hit on the U.S. charts in a career that would see him writing songs for some of the most notable country artists \u2013 from Charley Pride to George Strait.

Queen, however, had the answer: a catchy love song written by their bass player, John Deacon, and which was given the name \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019. Deacon penned just the one song for A Night At The Opera, Queen\u2019s fourth studio album. \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 was written about his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff, a former trainee teacher from Sheffield, and turned out to be an enduring hit. The song expressed his devotion in heartfelt lyrics: \u201cYou\u2019re my sunshine and I want you to know/That my feelings are true/I really love you/Oh, you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d Singer Freddie Mercury said he always liked \u201cthe almost Tamla Motown style of Deacon\u2019s songs\u201d. The band\u2019s bassist wrote the song at home. \u201cFreddie didn\u2019t like the electric piano, so I took it home and I started to learn on the electric piano and basically that\u2019s the song that came out when I was learning to play piano,\u201d said Deacon. \u201cIt was written on that instrument and it sounds best on that.\u201d The song, featuring clever arrangements which displayed the brilliant harmonising of the band, was recorded in August 1975 in London. Roger Taylor\u2019s deft drumming, with bass, snare and hi-hat, combined well with Deacon\u2019s Fender bass. Deacon also played the Wurlitzer EP-200 electric piano on the track, while Brian May worked his usual magic with five different guitar tracks on his famous Red Special. \u201cJohn didn\u2019t write that many songs but when he did \u2013 as with \u2018Another One Bites the Dust\u2019 and \u2018I Want To Break Free\u2019 \u2013 they were big, big hits,\u201d said May. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 became one of the most-played tracks on American radio. John was a dark horse, generally the quiet guy in Queen. We would ask him sometimes, \u2018Have you got anything, John?\u2019 and he was very self-effacing about what he had written. \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 was about his lovely lady wife.\u201d The success of the \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019 video persuaded the band to use that promotional tool again. The clip for \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 \u2013 which shows the band in a huge ballroom, with a glittering chandelier, surrounded by more than a thousand candles \u2013 was directed by Bruce Gowers. It was shot at Elstree Studios in London during an unseasonably warm spring day. There was no air conditioning and the heat from the candles and lights made for an uncomfortable session. For the video, Deacon played a grand piano, the same instrument Mercury used when the song was performed in concert. \u201cI refused to play that damn thing,\u201d Mercury said of the electric piano. \u201cIt\u2019s tiny and horrible and I don\u2019t like them. Why play those when you have a lovely superb piano?\u201d The three-minute single was released on 18 May 1976 and frequent radio plays helped it become a hit. \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 began an eight-week run in the UK singles charts on 3 July, reaching a peak position of No.7. It also reached No.16 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was later certified platinum in America, with more than one million copies sold. Coincidentally, country singer Don Williams had a hit with his own song titled \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 later that year. Queen\u2019s song has featured in numerous films and television shows, including The Simpsons, Family Guy and EastEnders. Deacon\u2019s sweet ballad, which also played at the end of the zombie-movie parody Shaun Of The Dead, has also been covered by other artists, including The Supernaturals (1997) and Stevie Ann (2014). When Queen released their album Live Killers in 1979, comprising performances of songs from concerts around Europe, they included a neat two-minute version of \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019. Four decades on from the chart success of \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019, Deacon lives quietly in London, away from the music business, and is still married to Veronica, the love of his life, with whom he raised six children. \u201c\n\nquestion: Who wrote the song 'You're My Best Friend'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "John Deacon", "usage": 1022}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It was written in 1975, the same year that Deacon married his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff, and accordingly, it is dedicated to her. It is also interesting to note that as of now, over 4 decades years later, John and Veronica are still married. And as evident from this song, his love for her was very much present from the start. For instance, he defines her as being the personification of all the world has to offer to him. In fact she is the one who actually gives him life. And even when he wanders astray, he has to come back to her, not only for the joy he experiences in her company but also because she is the one who has stood with him through thick and thin. In fact when life seems unfavorable to John, Veronica is the first one to show her support. Another notable characteristic that the subject of this song possesses is her ability to make the world in general seem like a better place to the singer. And all of this ultimately boils down to him coming to the conclusion that she is his \u201cbest friend\u201d and in fact has become an invaluable part of his earthly existence. This is the fourth song on the first side of Queen\u2019s 1975 album \u201cA Night at the Opera\u201d, which was their fourth studio album overall. Additional Queen albums this song is featured on are: Live Killers (1979) and Greatest Hits (1981). Furthermore, the song was also featured Queen\u2019s 2009 compilation album titled Absolute Greatest (2009). In 2014, it once again was featured in another compilation album by the band titled Queen Forever. Beautiful song. I love that Queen got all light and poppy for this one.

This is the fourth song on the first side of Queen\u2019s 1975 album \u201cA Night at the Opera\u201d, which was their fourth studio album overall. Additional Queen albums this song is featured on are: Live Killers (1979) and Greatest Hits (1981). Furthermore, the song was also featured Queen\u2019s 2009 compilation album titled Absolute Greatest (2009). In 2014, it once again was featured in another compilation album by the band titled Queen Forever. Beautiful song. I love that Queen got all light and poppy for this one.

Queen, however, had the answer: a catchy love song written by their bass player, John Deacon, and which was given the name \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend.\u201d Deacon penned just the one song for A Night At The Opera, Queen\u2019s fourth studio album. \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d was written about his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff, a former trainee teacher from Sheffield, and turned out to be an enduring hit. The song expressed his devotion in heartfelt lyrics: \u201cYou\u2019re my sunshine and I want you to know/That my feelings are true/I really love you/Oh, you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d Singer Freddie Mercury said he always liked \u201cthe almost Tamla Motown style of Deacon\u2019s songs.\u201d The band\u2019s bassist wrote the song at home. \u201cFreddie didn\u2019t like the electric piano, so I took it home and I started to learn on the electric piano and basically that\u2019s the song that came out when I was learning to play piano,\u201d said Deacon. \u201cIt was written on that instrument and it sounds best on that.\u201d Watch this video on YouTube The song, featuring clever arrangements which displayed the brilliant harmonizing of the band, was recorded in August 1975 in London. Roger Taylor\u2019s deft drumming, with bass, snare, and hi-hat, combined well with Deacon\u2019s Fender bass. Deacon also played the Wurlitzer EP-200 electric piano on the track, while Brian May worked his usual magic with five different guitar tracks on his famous Red Special. \u201cJohn didn\u2019t write that many songs but when he did \u2013 as with \u2018Another One Bites the Dust\u2019 and \u2018I Want To Break Free\u2019 \u2013 they were big, big hits,\u201d said May. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 became one of the most-played tracks on American radio.

It was shot at Elstree Studios in London during an unseasonably warm spring day. There was no air conditioning and the heat from the candles and lights made for an uncomfortable session. For the video, Deacon played a grand piano, the same instrument Mercury used when the song was performed in concert. \u201cI refused to play that damn thing,\u201d Mercury said of the electric piano. \u201cIt\u2019s tiny and horrible and I don\u2019t like them. Why play those when you have a lovely superb piano?\u201d The three-minute single was released on June 10, 1976, in the United States, and frequent radio plays helped it become a hit. \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d began an eight-week run in the UK singles charts on July 3, reaching a peak position of No.7. It also reached No.16 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was later certified platinum in America, with more than one million copies sold.

The song brought Williams his second No. 1 hit, as it ranked atop Billboard\u2019s Hot Country Songs chart and marked Williams\u2019 true beginning as a commercial juggernaut, as the song topped Canadian RPM Country Tracks. It even cracked the U.K. Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 35. It has since become one of his signature tunes and paved the way for several songs by Don Williams to enter the country charts. Written by songwriter Wayland Holyfield, \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d is a simple, genuine sentiment of love and friendship to a long-term romantic partner. \u201cYou\u2019re my bread when I\u2019m hungry. You\u2019re my shelter from troubled winds. You\u2019re my anchor in life\u2019s ocean. But most of all, you\u2019re my best friend,\u201d the song goes. Holyfield was actually just new in the songwriting business when he penned this song about his wife, but he knew it would resonate with every person who is in that type of special relationship. Indeed, it was! The moment Don Williams began singing the romantic ballad in his shows, he noticed how the audiences had already picked up all the lyrics. It then quickly grew into a major sing-along segment of his live shows. The song also marked a long and fruitful partnership between Williams and Holyfield. \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d was actually Holyfield\u2019s first No. 1 hit on the U.S. charts in a career that would see him writing songs for some of the most notable country artists \u2013 from Charley Pride to George Strait.

It was written in 1975, the same year that Deacon married his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff, and accordingly, it is dedicated to her. It is also interesting to note that as of now, over 4 decades years later, John and Veronica are still married. And as evident from this song, his love for her was very much present from the start. For instance, he defines her as being the personification of all the world has to offer to him. In fact she is the one who actually gives him life. And even when he wanders astray, he has to come back to her, not only for the joy he experiences in her company but also because she is the one who has stood with him through thick and thin. In fact when life seems unfavorable to John, Veronica is the first one to show her support. Another notable characteristic that the subject of this song possesses is her ability to make the world in general seem like a better place to the singer. And all of this ultimately boils down to him coming to the conclusion that she is his \u201cbest friend\u201d and in fact has become an invaluable part of his earthly existence.

The song brought Williams his second No. 1 hit, as it ranked atop Billboard\u2019s Hot Country Songs chart and marked Williams\u2019 true beginning as a commercial juggernaut, as the song topped Canadian RPM Country Tracks. It even cracked the U.K. Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 35. It has since become one of his signature tunes and paved the way for several songs by Don Williams to enter the country charts. Written by songwriter Wayland Holyfield, \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d is a simple, genuine sentiment of love and friendship to a long-term romantic partner. \u201cYou\u2019re my bread when I\u2019m hungry. You\u2019re my shelter from troubled winds. You\u2019re my anchor in life\u2019s ocean. But most of all, you\u2019re my best friend,\u201d the song goes. Holyfield was actually just new in the songwriting business when he penned this song about his wife, but he knew it would resonate with every person who is in that type of special relationship. Indeed, it was! The moment Don Williams began singing the romantic ballad in his shows, he noticed how the audiences had already picked up all the lyrics. It then quickly grew into a major sing-along segment of his live shows. The song also marked a long and fruitful partnership between Williams and Holyfield. \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d was actually Holyfield\u2019s first No. 1 hit on the U.S. charts in a career that would see him writing songs for some of the most notable country artists \u2013 from Charley Pride to George Strait.

Queen, however, had the answer: a catchy love song written by their bass player, John Deacon, and which was given the name \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019. Deacon penned just the one song for A Night At The Opera, Queen\u2019s fourth studio album. \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 was written about his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff, a former trainee teacher from Sheffield, and turned out to be an enduring hit. The song expressed his devotion in heartfelt lyrics: \u201cYou\u2019re my sunshine and I want you to know/That my feelings are true/I really love you/Oh, you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d Singer Freddie Mercury said he always liked \u201cthe almost Tamla Motown style of Deacon\u2019s songs\u201d. The band\u2019s bassist wrote the song at home. \u201cFreddie didn\u2019t like the electric piano, so I took it home and I started to learn on the electric piano and basically that\u2019s the song that came out when I was learning to play piano,\u201d said Deacon. \u201cIt was written on that instrument and it sounds best on that.\u201d The song, featuring clever arrangements which displayed the brilliant harmonising of the band, was recorded in August 1975 in London. Roger Taylor\u2019s deft drumming, with bass, snare and hi-hat, combined well with Deacon\u2019s Fender bass. Deacon also played the Wurlitzer EP-200 electric piano on the track, while Brian May worked his usual magic with five different guitar tracks on his famous Red Special. \u201cJohn didn\u2019t write that many songs but when he did \u2013 as with \u2018Another One Bites the Dust\u2019 and \u2018I Want To Break Free\u2019 \u2013 they were big, big hits,\u201d said May. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 became one of the most-played tracks on American radio. John was a dark horse, generally the quiet guy in Queen. We would ask him sometimes, \u2018Have you got anything, John?\u2019 and he was very self-effacing about what he had written. \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 was about his lovely lady wife.\u201d The success of the \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019 video persuaded the band to use that promotional tool again. The clip for \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 \u2013 which shows the band in a huge ballroom, with a glittering chandelier, surrounded by more than a thousand candles \u2013 was directed by Bruce Gowers. It was shot at Elstree Studios in London during an unseasonably warm spring day. There was no air conditioning and the heat from the candles and lights made for an uncomfortable session. For the video, Deacon played a grand piano, the same instrument Mercury used when the song was performed in concert. \u201cI refused to play that damn thing,\u201d Mercury said of the electric piano. \u201cIt\u2019s tiny and horrible and I don\u2019t like them. Why play those when you have a lovely superb piano?\u201d The three-minute single was released on 18 May 1976 and frequent radio plays helped it become a hit. \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 began an eight-week run in the UK singles charts on 3 July, reaching a peak position of No.7. It also reached No.16 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was later certified platinum in America, with more than one million copies sold. Coincidentally, country singer Don Williams had a hit with his own song titled \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 later that year. Queen\u2019s song has featured in numerous films and television shows, including The Simpsons, Family Guy and EastEnders. Deacon\u2019s sweet ballad, which also played at the end of the zombie-movie parody Shaun Of The Dead, has also been covered by other artists, including The Supernaturals (1997) and Stevie Ann (2014). When Queen released their album Live Killers in 1979, comprising performances of songs from concerts around Europe, they included a neat two-minute version of \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019. Four decades on from the chart success of \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019, Deacon lives quietly in London, away from the music business, and is still married to Veronica, the love of his life, with whom he raised six children. \u201c\n\nquestion: How does Deacon define his wife in the song?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Deacon defines his wife as \"my sunshine\" and \"my best friend.\"", "usage": 1034}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It was written in 1975, the same year that Deacon married his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff, and accordingly, it is dedicated to her. It is also interesting to note that as of now, over 4 decades years later, John and Veronica are still married. And as evident from this song, his love for her was very much present from the start. For instance, he defines her as being the personification of all the world has to offer to him. In fact she is the one who actually gives him life. And even when he wanders astray, he has to come back to her, not only for the joy he experiences in her company but also because she is the one who has stood with him through thick and thin. In fact when life seems unfavorable to John, Veronica is the first one to show her support. Another notable characteristic that the subject of this song possesses is her ability to make the world in general seem like a better place to the singer. And all of this ultimately boils down to him coming to the conclusion that she is his \u201cbest friend\u201d and in fact has become an invaluable part of his earthly existence. This is the fourth song on the first side of Queen\u2019s 1975 album \u201cA Night at the Opera\u201d, which was their fourth studio album overall. Additional Queen albums this song is featured on are: Live Killers (1979) and Greatest Hits (1981). Furthermore, the song was also featured Queen\u2019s 2009 compilation album titled Absolute Greatest (2009). In 2014, it once again was featured in another compilation album by the band titled Queen Forever. Beautiful song. I love that Queen got all light and poppy for this one. So sweet that Deacy found true love with Veronica, wrote the song and learned to play electric piano to record the song Your email address will not be published.

It was written in 1975, the same year that Deacon married his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff, and accordingly, it is dedicated to her. It is also interesting to note that as of now, over 4 decades years later, John and Veronica are still married. And as evident from this song, his love for her was very much present from the start. For instance, he defines her as being the personification of all the world has to offer to him. In fact she is the one who actually gives him life. And even when he wanders astray, he has to come back to her, not only for the joy he experiences in her company but also because she is the one who has stood with him through thick and thin. In fact when life seems unfavorable to John, Veronica is the first one to show her support. Another notable characteristic that the subject of this song possesses is her ability to make the world in general seem like a better place to the singer. And all of this ultimately boils down to him coming to the conclusion that she is his \u201cbest friend\u201d and in fact has become an invaluable part of his earthly existence. This is the fourth song on the first side of Queen\u2019s 1975 album \u201cA Night at the Opera\u201d, which was their fourth studio album overall. Additional Queen albums this song is featured on are: Live Killers (1979) and Greatest Hits (1981). Furthermore, the song was also featured Queen\u2019s 2009 compilation album titled Absolute Greatest (2009). In 2014, it once again was featured in another compilation album by the band titled Queen Forever. Beautiful song. I love that Queen got all light and poppy for this one. So sweet that Deacy found true love with Veronica, wrote the song and learned to play electric piano to record the song Your email address will not be published.

Published on By Picking a follow-up to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d which quickly became one of the best-selling singles of all time after its release, on October 31, 1975, would have been a challenge for any band. Queen, however, had the answer: a catchy love song written by their bass player, John Deacon, and which was given the name \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend.\u201d Deacon penned just the one song for A Night At The Opera, Queen\u2019s fourth studio album. \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d was written about his wife, Veronica Tetzlaff, a former trainee teacher from Sheffield, and turned out to be an enduring hit. The song expressed his devotion in heartfelt lyrics: \u201cYou\u2019re my sunshine and I want you to know/That my feelings are true/I really love you/Oh, you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d Singer Freddie Mercury said he always liked \u201cthe almost Tamla Motown style of Deacon\u2019s songs.\u201d The band\u2019s bassist wrote the song at home. \u201cFreddie didn\u2019t like the electric piano, so I took it home and I started to learn on the electric piano and basically that\u2019s the song that came out when I was learning to play piano,\u201d said Deacon. \u201cIt was written on that instrument and it sounds best on that.\u201d Watch this video on YouTube The song, featuring clever arrangements which displayed the brilliant harmonizing of the band, was recorded in August 1975 in London. Roger Taylor\u2019s deft drumming, with bass, snare, and hi-hat, combined well with Deacon\u2019s Fender bass. Deacon also played the Wurlitzer EP-200 electric piano on the track, while Brian May worked his usual magic with five different guitar tracks on his famous Red Special. \u201cJohn didn\u2019t write that many songs but when he did \u2013 as with \u2018Another One Bites the Dust\u2019 and \u2018I Want To Break Free\u2019 \u2013 they were big, big hits,\u201d said May. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 became one of the most-played tracks on American radio. John was a dark horse, generally the quiet guy in Queen. We would ask him sometimes, \u2018Have you got anything, John?\u2019 and he was very self-effacing about what he had written. \u2018You\u2019re My Best Friend\u2019 was about his lovely lady wife.\u201d The success of the \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d video persuaded the band to use that promotional tool again. The clip for \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d \u2013 which shows the band in a huge ballroom, with a glittering chandelier, surrounded by more than a thousand candles \u2013 was directed by Bruce Gowers. It was shot at Elstree Studios in London during an unseasonably warm spring day. There was no air conditioning and the heat from the candles and lights made for an uncomfortable session. For the video, Deacon played a grand piano, the same instrument Mercury used when the song was performed in concert. \u201cI refused to play that damn thing,\u201d Mercury said of the electric piano. \u201cIt\u2019s tiny and horrible and I don\u2019t like them. Why play those when you have a lovely superb piano?\u201d The three-minute single was released on June 10, 1976, in the United States, and frequent radio plays helped it become a hit. \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d began an eight-week run in the UK singles charts on July 3, reaching a peak position of No.7. It also reached No.16 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was later certified platinum in America, with more than one million copies sold. Coincidentally, country singer Don Williams had a hit with his own song titled \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d later that year. Queen\u2019s song has featured in numerous films and television shows, including The Simpsons, Family Guy, and EastEnders. Deacon\u2019s sweet ballad, which also played at the end of the zombie-movie parody Shaun Of The Dead, has also been covered by other artists, including The Supernaturals (1997) and Stevie Ann (2014). When Queen released their album Live Killers in 1979, comprising performances of songs from concerts around Europe, they included a neat two-minute version of \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend.\u201d Decades on from the chart success of \u201cYou\u2019\n\nquestion: What does Deacon ultimately conclude about his wife?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Deacon ultimately concludes that his wife is his best friend.", "usage": 1025}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The song brought Williams his second No. 1 hit, as it ranked atop Billboard\u2019s Hot Country Songs chart and marked Williams\u2019 true beginning as a commercial juggernaut, as the song topped Canadian RPM Country Tracks. It even cracked the U.K. Singles Chart, where it peaked at No. 35. It has since become one of his signature tunes and paved the way for several songs by Don Williams to enter the country charts. Written by songwriter Wayland Holyfield, \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d is a simple, genuine sentiment of love and friendship to a long-term romantic partner. \u201cYou\u2019re my bread when I\u2019m hungry. You\u2019re my shelter from troubled winds. You\u2019re my anchor in life\u2019s ocean. But most of all, you\u2019re my best friend,\u201d the song goes. Holyfield was actually just new in the songwriting business when he penned this song about his wife, but he knew it would resonate with every person who is in that type of special relationship. Indeed, it was! The moment Don Williams began singing the romantic ballad in his shows, he noticed how the audiences had already picked up all the lyrics. It then quickly grew into a major sing-along segment of his live shows. The song also marked a long and fruitful partnership between Williams and Holyfield. \u201cYou\u2019re My Best Friend\u201d was actually Holyfield\u2019s first No. 1 hit on the U.S. charts in a career that would see him writing songs for some of the most notable country artists \u2013 from Charley Pride to George Strait.
