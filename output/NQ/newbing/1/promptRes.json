Ahh!, with the band releasing that album in May 1988. B-sides \"Livin' for the Minute\" and \"Look But You Can't Touch\" were included in the single's release. The song was released as a single in 1988 on Enigma Records and reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #19 on the Mainstream rock charts. It also charted at number 10 on the Australian charts and number 35 on the UK Singles chart. The music video features a restaurant employee, played by the same actor who appeared in the video for M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"You're All I Need\", washing dishes while listening to the Kiss hit single \"Rock and Roll All Nite\", performed by Poison who recorded that for the Less than Zero soundtrack in 1987. The manager is angry that he enters, turns off the radio, and delivers to the employee a scathing reprimand, reminding the employee that he is being paid \"to wash dishes, not to listen to that... that rock 'n' roll,\" and accusing him of \"moving in two speeds: slow, and stop.\" The manager exits, whereupon the employee abandons the dishes and kicks open a nearby door to reveal a concert hall stage, upon which the band then performs the song. When the song is over, the manager returns, discovering, to his surprise, that all the dishes are washed. It was played in heavy rotation on MTV in 1987. \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" is widely regarded as one of Poison's best songs. In 2017, Billboard and OC Weekly ranked the song number nine and number four, respectively, on their lists of the ten greatest Poison tracks. Music critic Steve Huey of Allmusic has also stated that \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" became one of the bands \"most widely recognized signature songs\" as well as that parent album Open Up and Say... Ahh! wound up having \"solidified the group's status as hair metal's top party band.\" A 2007 Xbox commercial featured a cover version by a school choir.  \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" was performed by Poison, with the cast of Rock of Ages, at the 63rd Tony Awards on June 7, 2009. After the performance, as the band made their way backstage, a piece of the stage scenery collapsed on Bret Michaels. The riff is similar to the opening riff from \"Deuce\" by Kiss. It appears in a 2017 TV commercial for Nissan's Heisman House and ESPN, featuring Eddie George and other Heisman Trophy winners. It also appears in a 2022 Direct Line television advert featuring Tessa Thompson in character as Valkyrie (Marvel Comics). \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" is on the following albums: Reel Big Fish covered the song on their 2009 album Fame, Fortune and Fornication. The song used in the movie The Rocker where it was covered by the fictional band A.D.D. The actual recording was mostly done by Chad Fischer with Teddy Geiger singing lead vocals. This version was released on the film's soundtrack album. Adam Brand and the Outlaws covered the song on the 2016 album Adam Brand and the Outlaws.\n\nquestion: Who sings the song 'Nothin' But a Good Time'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Poison", "usage": 819}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Made famous by Italian tenor, Andrea Bocelli, after he debuted the song at the 1995 Sanremo Music Festival, the work has become one of the musician\u2019s best-known. Released on Bocelli\u2019s second studio album, the song has become one of the best-selling singles of all time. It was written by Francesco Sartori, an Italian trumpet player, pianist and composer, and its lyrics were by songwriter, Lucio Quarantotto. Due to the international acclaim Bocelli found with the song, he went on to release further versions of the song in other languages. Read more: When the world saw a young Andrea Bocelli sing \u2018Con te partir\u00f2\u2019 for the very first time Whilst the original 1995 song was written in Italian, Bocelli went on to release both an English and Spanish version. In 1996 Bocelli released a second version of the song as a duet with English soprano, Sarah Brightman. Sung partly in English, the song went on to sell more than 12 million copies worldwide. It became the biggest-selling single in Germany of all time, and the duo would go on to record a version sung in German and Italian. Bocelli\u2019s Spanish version of the song released a year later in 1997, titled, Por ti volar\u00e9 (in English \u2013 For You I Will Fly). Read more: \u2018Time to Say Goodbye\u2019 by Andrea Bocelli named a funeral favourite In a 2019 study by Co-op Funeralcare, Bocelli and Brightman\u2019s performance of \u2018Time to Say Goodbye\u2019 was ranked as the nation\u2019s second favourite choice of music for a funeral, due to its farewell theme. But, despite the seemingly lyrical \u2018goodbye\u2019, there are conflicting thoughts as to what the lyrics of \u2018Time to Say Goodbye\u2019 are actually trying to say. In English, the lyrics seem to tell the story of a protagonist who is saying goodbye to countries they never saw or shared with his lover. But then halfway through the song, it seems the lovers will in fact go to those countries... except they\u2019ll be travelling on ships that don\u2019t exist anymore. So it\u2019s time to say goodbye again. Not the clearest of translations. However, due to the romantic and hopeful nature of the melody, many have interpreted the song as not being on the theme of \u2018goodbyes\u2019 but rather, new chapters. The literal translation of the Italian tune, Con te partir\u00f2 is I will leave with you, suggesting instead that no matter where the lovers in the song are going, they will be going together.

Ahh!, with the band releasing that album in May 1988. B-sides \"Livin' for the Minute\" and \"Look But You Can't Touch\" were included in the single's release. The song was released as a single in 1988 on Enigma Records and reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #19 on the Mainstream rock charts. It also charted at number 10 on the Australian charts and number 35 on the UK Singles chart. The music video features a restaurant employee, played by the same actor who appeared in the video for M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"You're All I Need\", washing dishes while listening to the Kiss hit single \"Rock and Roll All Nite\", performed by Poison who recorded that for the Less than Zero soundtrack in 1987. The manager is angry that he enters, turns off the radio, and delivers to the employee a scathing reprimand, reminding the employee that he is being paid \"to wash dishes, not to listen to that... that rock 'n' roll,\" and accusing him of \"moving in two speeds: slow, and stop.\" The manager exits, whereupon the employee abandons the dishes and kicks open a nearby door to reveal a concert hall stage, upon which the band then performs the song. When the song is over, the manager returns, discovering, to his surprise, that all the dishes are washed. It was played in heavy rotation on MTV in 1987. \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" is widely regarded as one of Poison's best songs. In 2017, Billboard and OC Weekly ranked the song number nine and number four, respectively, on their lists of the ten greatest Poison tracks. Music critic Steve Huey of Allmusic has also stated that \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" became one of the bands \"most widely recognized signature songs\" as well as that parent album Open Up and Say... Ahh! wound up having \"solidified the group's status as hair metal's top party band.\" A 2007 Xbox commercial featured a cover version by a school choir.  \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" was performed by Poison, with the cast of Rock of Ages, at the 63rd Tony Awards on June 7, 2009. After the performance, as the band made their way backstage, a piece of the stage scenery collapsed on Bret Michaels. The riff is similar to the opening riff from \"Deuce\" by Kiss. It appears in a 2017 TV commercial for Nissan's Heisman House and ESPN, featuring Eddie George and other Heisman Trophy winners. It also appears in a 2022 Direct Line television advert featuring Tessa Thompson in character as Valkyrie (Marvel Comics). \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" is on the following albums: Reel Big Fish covered the song on their 2009 album Fame, Fortune and Fornication. The song used in the movie The Rocker where it was covered by the fictional band A.D.D. The actual recording was mostly done by Chad Fischer with Teddy Geiger singing lead vocals. This version was released on the film's soundtrack album. Adam Brand and the Outlaws covered the song on the 2016 album Adam Brand and the Outlaws.\n\nquestion: What is the song 'Nothin' But a Good Time' the first single from?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Open Up and Say...

Made famous by Italian tenor, Andrea Bocelli, after he debuted the song at the 1995 Sanremo Music Festival, the work has become one of the musician\u2019s best-known. Released on Bocelli\u2019s second studio album, the song has become one of the best-selling singles of all time. It was written by Francesco Sartori, an Italian trumpet player, pianist and composer, and its lyrics were by songwriter, Lucio Quarantotto. Due to the international acclaim Bocelli found with the song, he went on to release further versions of the song in other languages. Read more: When the world saw a young Andrea Bocelli sing \u2018Con te partir\u00f2\u2019 for the very first time Whilst the original 1995 song was written in Italian, Bocelli went on to release both an English and Spanish version. In 1996 Bocelli released a second version of the song as a duet with English soprano, Sarah Brightman. Sung partly in English, the song went on to sell more than 12 million copies worldwide. It became the biggest-selling single in Germany of all time, and the duo would go on to record a version sung in German and Italian. Bocelli\u2019s Spanish version of the song released a year later in 1997, titled, Por ti volar\u00e9 (in English \u2013 For You I Will Fly). Read more: \u2018Time to Say Goodbye\u2019 by Andrea Bocelli named a funeral favourite In a 2019 study by Co-op Funeralcare, Bocelli and Brightman\u2019s performance of \u2018Time to Say Goodbye\u2019 was ranked as the nation\u2019s second favourite choice of music for a funeral, due to its farewell theme. But, despite the seemingly lyrical \u2018goodbye\u2019, there are conflicting thoughts as to what the lyrics of \u2018Time to Say Goodbye\u2019 are actually trying to say. In English, the lyrics seem to tell the story of a protagonist who is saying goodbye to countries they never saw or shared with his lover. But then halfway through the song, it seems the lovers will in fact go to those countries... except they\u2019ll be travelling on ships that don\u2019t exist anymore. So it\u2019s time to say goodbye again. Not the clearest of translations. However, due to the romantic and hopeful nature of the melody, many have interpreted the song as not being on the theme of \u2018goodbyes\u2019 but rather, new chapters. The literal translation of the Italian tune, Con te partir\u00f2 is I will leave with you, suggesting instead that no matter where the lovers in the song are going, they will be going together.

Ahh!, with the band releasing that album in May 1988. B-sides \"Livin' for the Minute\" and \"Look But You Can't Touch\" were included in the single's release. The song was released as a single in 1988 on Enigma Records and reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #19 on the Mainstream rock charts. It also charted at number 10 on the Australian charts and number 35 on the UK Singles chart. The music video features a restaurant employee, played by the same actor who appeared in the video for M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's \"You're All I Need\", washing dishes while listening to the Kiss hit single \"Rock and Roll All Nite\", performed by Poison who recorded that for the Less than Zero soundtrack in 1987. The manager is angry that he enters, turns off the radio, and delivers to the employee a scathing reprimand, reminding the employee that he is being paid \"to wash dishes, not to listen to that... that rock 'n' roll,\" and accusing him of \"moving in two speeds: slow, and stop.\" The manager exits, whereupon the employee abandons the dishes and kicks open a nearby door to reveal a concert hall stage, upon which the band then performs the song. When the song is over, the manager returns, discovering, to his surprise, that all the dishes are washed. It was played in heavy rotation on MTV in 1987. \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" is widely regarded as one of Poison's best songs. In 2017, Billboard and OC Weekly ranked the song number nine and number four, respectively, on their lists of the ten greatest Poison tracks. Music critic Steve Huey of Allmusic has also stated that \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" became one of the bands \"most widely recognized signature songs\" as well as that parent album Open Up and Say... Ahh! wound up having \"solidified the group's status as hair metal's top party band.\" A 2007 Xbox commercial featured a cover version by a school choir.  \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" was performed by Poison, with the cast of Rock of Ages, at the 63rd Tony Awards on June 7, 2009. After the performance, as the band made their way backstage, a piece of the stage scenery collapsed on Bret Michaels. The riff is similar to the opening riff from \"Deuce\" by Kiss. It appears in a 2017 TV commercial for Nissan's Heisman House and ESPN, featuring Eddie George and other Heisman Trophy winners. It also appears in a 2022 Direct Line television advert featuring Tessa Thompson in character as Valkyrie (Marvel Comics). \"Nothin' But a Good Time\" is on the following albums: Reel Big Fish covered the song on their 2009 album Fame, Fortune and Fornication. The song used in the movie The Rocker where it was covered by the fictional band A.D.D. The actual recording was mostly done by Chad Fischer with Teddy Geiger singing lead vocals. This version was released on the film's soundtrack album. Adam Brand and the Outlaws covered the song on the 2016 album Adam Brand and the Outlaws.\n\nquestion: What position did the song 'Nothin' But a Good Time' reach on the Billboard Hot 100 chart?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "#6", "usage": 828}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Made famous by Italian tenor, Andrea Bocelli, after he debuted the song at the 1995 Sanremo Music Festival, the work has become one of the musician\u2019s best-known. Released on Bocelli\u2019s second studio album, the song has become one of the best-selling singles of all time. It was written by Francesco Sartori, an Italian trumpet player, pianist and composer, and its lyrics were by songwriter, Lucio Quarantotto. Due to the international acclaim Bocelli found with the song, he went on to release further versions of the song in other languages. Read more: When the world saw a young Andrea Bocelli sing \u2018Con te partir\u00f2\u2019 for the very first time Whilst the original 1995 song was written in Italian, Bocelli went on to release both an English and Spanish version. In 1996 Bocelli released a second version of the song as a duet with English soprano, Sarah Brightman. Sung partly in English, the song went on to sell more than 12 million copies worldwide. It became the biggest-selling single in Germany of all time, and the duo would go on to record a version sung in German and Italian. Bocelli\u2019s Spanish version of the song released a year later in 1997, titled, Por ti volar\u00e9 (in English \u2013 For You I Will Fly). Read more: \u2018Time to Say Goodbye\u2019 by Andrea Bocelli named a funeral favourite In a 2019 study by Co-op Funeralcare, Bocelli and Brightman\u2019s performance of \u2018Time to Say Goodbye\u2019 was ranked as the nation\u2019s second favourite choice of music for a funeral, due to its farewell theme. But, despite the seemingly lyrical \u2018goodbye\u2019, there are conflicting thoughts as to what the lyrics of \u2018Time to Say Goodbye\u2019 are actually trying to say. In English, the lyrics seem to tell the story of a protagonist who is saying goodbye to countries they never saw or shared with his lover. But then halfway through the song, it seems the lovers will in fact go to those countries... except they\u2019ll be travelling on ships that don\u2019t exist anymore. So it\u2019s time to say goodbye again. Not the clearest of translations. However, due to the romantic and hopeful nature of the melody, many have interpreted the song as not being on the theme of \u2018goodbyes\u2019 but rather, new chapters. The literal translation of the Italian tune, Con te partir\u00f2 is I will leave with you, suggesting instead that no matter where the lovers in the song are going, they will be going together.
