What we eat, where we go to school, what kind of education we receive, how our tax money is spent, and what we do in our free time are all affected by government. Americans are often unaware of the pervasiveness of government in their everyday lives, and many are unsure precisely what it does. Here we will look at what government is, what it does, and how the government of the United States differs from other kinds of governments. The term government describes the means by which a society organizes itself and how it allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs. Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity, secure national borders, and the safety and well-being of citizens. Governments also provide benefits for their citizens. The type of benefits provided differ according to the country and their specific type of governmental system, but governments commonly provide such things as education, health care, and an infrastructure for transportation. The term politics refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals, especially those related to the division of resources within a nation. Sometimes governmental systems are confused with economic systems. This is because certain types of political thought or governmental organization are closely related to or develop with certain types of economic systems. For example, the economic system of capitalism in Western Europe and North America developed at roughly the same time as ideas about democratic republics, self-government, and natural rights. At this time, the idea of liberty became an important concept. According to John Locke, an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century, all people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed. In the eighteenth century, in Great Britain\u2019s North American colonies, and later in France, this developed into the idea that people should govern themselves through elected representatives and not a king; only those representatives chosen by the people had the right to make laws to govern them. Similarly, Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher who was born nineteen years after Locke\u2019s death, believed that all people should be free to acquire property in any way that they wished. Instead of being controlled by government, business, and industry, Smith argued, people should be allowed to operate as they wish and keep the proceeds of their work. Competition would ensure that prices remained low and faulty goods disappeared from the market. In this way, businesses would reap profits, consumers would have their needs satisfied, and society as a whole would prosper. Smith discussed these ideas, which formed the basis for industrial capitalism, in his book The Wealth of Nations, which was published in 1776, the same year that the Declaration of Independence was written. Representative government and capitalism developed together in the United States, and many Americans tend to equate democracy, a political system in which people govern themselves, with capitalism. In theory, a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled, for good or bad, by government. Capitalism, in turn, relies on individualism. At the same time, successful capitalists prefer political systems over which they can exert at least some influence in order to maintain their liberty. Democracy and capitalism do not have to go hand in hand, however. Indeed, one might argue that a capitalist economic system might be bad for democracy in some respects. Although Smith theorized that capitalism would lead to prosperity for all, this has not necessarily been the case. Great gaps in wealth between the owners of major businesses, industries, and financial institutions and those who work for others in exchange for wages exist in many capitalist nations. In turn, great wealth may give a very small minority great influence over the government\u2014a greater influence than that held by the majority of the population, which will be discussed later. Socialism is an alternative economic system. In socialist societies, the means of generating wealth, such as factories, large farms, and banks, are owned by the government and not by private individuals. The government accumulates wealth and then redistributes it to citizens, primarily in the form of social programs that provide such things as free or inexpensive health care, education, and childcare. In socialist countries, the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity, transportation systems like airlines and railroads, and telecommunications systems. In many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy: only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government. For example, in China, the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party. In the United States, the democratic government works closely together with its capitalist economic system. The interconnectedness of the two affects the way in which goods and services are distributed. The market provides many goods and services needed by Americans. For example, food, clothing, and housing are provided in ample supply by private businesses that earn a profit in return. These\n\nquestion: What is the government of the United States best described as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "representative democracy", "usage": 1107}, "You are an answer-extraction expert. Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The United States Government: A Representative Democracy\n\nevidence:  goods and services are known as private goods.1 People can purchase what they need in the quantity in which they need it. This, of course, is the ideal. In reality, those who live in poverty cannot always afford to buy ample food and clothing to meet their needs, or the food and clothing that they can afford to buy in abundance is of inferior quality. Also, it is often difficult to find adequate housing; housing in the most desirable neighborhoods\u2014those that have low crime rates and good schools\u2014is often too expensive for poor or working-class (and sometimes middle-class) people to buy or rent. Thus, the market cannot provide everything (in enough quantity or at low enough costs) in order to meet everyone\u2019s needs. Therefore, some goods are provided by the government. Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called public goods. Two such public goods are national security and education. It is difficult to see how a private business could protect the United States from attack. How could it build its own armies and create plans for defense and attack? Who would pay the men and women who served? Where would the intelligence come from? Due to its ability to tax, draw upon the resources of an entire nation, and compel citizen compliance, only government is capable of protecting the nation. Similarly, public schools provide education for all children in the United States. Children of all religions, races and ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, and levels of academic ability can attend public schools free of charge from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. It would be impossible for private schools to provide an education for all of the nation\u2019s children. Private schools do provide some education in the United States; however, they charge tuition, and only those parents who can afford to pay their fees (or whose children gain a scholarship) can attend these institutions. Some schools charge very high tuition, the equivalent to the tuition at a private college. If private schools were the only educational institutions, most poor and working-class children and many middle-class children would be uneducated. Private schooling is a type of good called a toll good. Toll goods are available to many people, and many people can make use of them, but only if they can pay the price. They occupy a middle ground between public and private goods. All parents may send their children to public schools in the United States. They can choose to send their children to a private school, but the private school will charge them. On the other hand, public schools, which are operated by the government, provide free education so all children can attend school. Therefore, everyone in the nation benefits from the educated voters and workers produced by the public school system. Another distinction between public and private goods is that public goods are available to all, typically without additional charge. What other public goods does government provide in the United States? At the federal, state, and local level, government provides stability and security, not only in the form of a military but also in the form of police and fire departments. Government provides other valuable goods and services such as public education, public transportation, mail service, and food, housing, and health care for the poor (Figure 1.2). If a house catches on fire, the fire department does not demand payment before they put the fire out. If someone breaks into a house and tries to harm the occupants, the police will try to protect them and arrest the intruder, but the police department will not request payment for services rendered. The provision of these goods and services is funded by citizens paying into the general tax base. Government also performs the important job of protecting common goods: goods that all people may use free of charge but that are of limited supply, such as fish in the sea or clean drinking water. Because everyone can use these goods, they must be protected so a few people do not take everything that is available and leave others with nothing. Some examples of common goods, private goods, public goods, and toll goods are listed below (Figure 1.3). This federal website shares information about the many services the government provides. One of the many important things government does is regulate public access to common goods like natural resources. Unlike public goods, which all people may use without charge, common goods are in limited supply. If more public schools are needed, the government can build more. If more firefighters or mail carriers are needed, the government can hire them. Public lands and wildlife, however, are not goods the government can simply multiply if supply falls due to demand. Indeed, if some people take too freely from the supply of common goods, there will not be enough left for others to use. Fish are one of the many common goods in which the government currently regulates access. It does so to ensure that certain species are not fished into extinction, thus depriving future generations of an important food source and a means to make a living. This idea is known as sustainability. Environmentalists want to set strict fishing limits on a variety of species. Commercial fishers resist these limits, claiming they are\n\nquestion: What is the government of the United States best described as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "A representative democracy.", "usage": 1108}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Currently, fishing limits are set by a combination of scientists, politicians, local resource managers, and groups representing the interests of fishers.3 Should the government regulate fishing? Is it right to interfere with people\u2019s ability to earn money today in order to protect the access of future generations to the nation\u2019s common goods? Besides providing stability and goods and services for all, government also creates a structure by which goods and services can be made available to the people. In the United States, people elect representatives to city councils, state legislatures, and Congress. These bodies make laws to govern their respective jurisdictions. They also pass measures to raise money, through the imposition of taxes on such things as income, property, and sales. Local, state, and national governments also draft budgets to determine how the revenue taken in will be spent for services. On the local level, funds are allotted for education, police and fire departments, and maintenance of public parks. State governments allocate money for state colleges and universities, maintenance of state roads and bridges, and wildlife management, among other priorities. On the national level, money goes to such things as defense, Social Security, pensions for veterans, maintenance of federal courts and prisons, and management of national parks. At each level, representatives elected by the people try to secure funding for things that will benefit those who live in the areas they represent. Once money has been allocated, government agencies at each level then receive funds for the purposes mentioned above and use them to provide services to the public. Local, state, and national governments also make laws to maintain order and to ensure the efficient functioning of society, including the fair operation of the business marketplace. In the United States, for example, Congress passes laws regulating banking, and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories, the purity of food offered for sale, and the safety of toys and automobiles. In this way, government checks the actions of business, something that it would not do if capitalism in the United States functioned strictly in the manner that Adam Smith believed it should\u2026almost entirely unregulated. Besides providing goods to citizens and maintaining public safety, most governments also provide a means for citizens to participate in government and to make their opinions known to those in power. Western democracies like the United States, Britain, France, and others protect citizens\u2019 freedom of speech and the press. These nations, and others in the world, also allow citizens to vote. As noted earlier, politics is the process by which choices are made regarding how resources will be allocated and which economic and social policies government will pursue. Put more simply, politics is the process of who gets what and how. Politics involves choosing which values government will support and which it will not. If government chooses to support an ideal such as individualism, it may choose to loosen regulations on business and industry or to cut taxes so that people have more money to invest in business. If it chooses to support an ideal such as egalitarianism, which calls for equal treatment for all and the destruction of socioeconomic inequalities, it may raise taxes in order to be able to spend more on public education, public transportation, housing for the poor, and care for the elderly. If, for example, the government is more concerned with national security than with individual liberty, it may authorize the tapping of people\u2019s phones and restrict what newspapers may publish. If liberty is more important, then government will place greater restrictions on the extent that law enforcement agencies can intrude upon citizens\u2019 private communications. The political process and the input of citizens help determine the answer. Civic engagement, or the participation that connects citizens to government, is a vital ingredient of politics. In the United States, citizens play an important role in influencing what policies are pursued, what values the government chooses to support, what initiatives are granted funding, and who gets to make the final decisions. Political engagement can take many forms: reading about politics, listening to news reports, discussing politics, attending (or watching televised) political debates, donating money to political campaigns, handing out flyers promoting a candidate, voting, joining protest marches, and writing letters to their elected representatives. The government of the United States can best be described as a republic, or representative democracy. A democracy is a government in which political power\u2014influence over institutions, leaders, and policies\u2014rests in the hands of the people. In a representative democracy, however, the citizens do not govern directly. Instead, they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf. Most representative governments favor majority rule: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority. If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it\n\nquestion: What is the government of the United States best described as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "A republic or representative democracy.", "usage": 1113}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

However, in representative governments like the United States, minority rights are protected: people cannot be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be. For example, let\u2019s say American society decided that atheists, people who do not believe that God exists, were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country. Even though atheists only account for about 7 percent of the population, they would be protected due to minority rights.4 Even though the number of Americans who believe in God far outweighs the number who do not, the minority is still protected. Because decisions are made through majority rule, making your opinions known and voting for those men and women who make decisions that affect all of us are critical and influential forms of civic engagement in a representative democracy such as the United States. In a direct democracy, unlike representative democracy, people participate directly in making government decisions. For example, in ancient Athens, the most famous example of a direct democracy, all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly. Here they debated and voted for or against all proposed laws. Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy\u2014the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government\u2014some elements of direct democracy do exist in the United States. While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress, people may still directly vote on certain issues. For example, a referendum or proposed law might be placed on the ballot for citizens to vote on directly during state or local elections instead of leaving the matter in the hands of the state legislature. At New England town meetings, all residents are allowed to debate decisions affecting the town (Figure 1.5). Such occasions provide additional opportunities for civic engagement. Most countries now have some form of representative government.5 At the other end of the political spectrum are elite-driven forms of government. In a monarchy, one ruler, usually a hereditary ruler, holds political power. Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law, and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country, this is not always the case. Many southwest Asian kingdoms, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted. As discussed earlier, another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy, in which a handful of elite members of society, often those who belong to a particular political party, hold all political power. For example, in Cuba, as in China, only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office, and the party\u2019s most important members make all government decisions. Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature. Under totalitarianism, the government is more important than the citizens, and it controls all aspects of citizens\u2019 lives. Citizens\u2019 rights are limited, and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition. These forms of government are fairly rare. North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government. The CIA website provides information about the types of government across the world. As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.

The elected representatives are in turn accountable to the electorate for their actions. As a form of democracy, representative democracy exists in contrast to direct democracy, in which all citizens directly vote on laws to be passed and other issues. Most modern countries are representative democracies, and, as such, they face many challenges. Ancient Rome practiced the earliest known form of representative democracy in the Western world. The Romans called their state a republic (from the Latin respublica, meaning, literally, \u201ca thing that belongs to the people\u201d). During the era of the Roman Republic, which began in 509 bce, meetings were held in a public space, known as the forum, at the centre of each city within Roman territory. Citizenship was typically conferred by birth to all men if both parents were Roman citizens, though one of them, usually the mother, could be an alien with the right to contract a Roman marriage. Citizenship was also granted by naturalization and by manumission of enslaved people. As the republic evolved, Roman government came to have four assemblies along with the Senate, which had existed in various forms for centuries. The four assemblies, or comitia, were the Comitia Curiata, drawn from men claiming affiliation with one of several tribal groups (believed to be three groups originally created by Romulus); the Comitia Centuriata, made up of military units; the Concilium Plebis, consisting of plebeians; and the Comitia Tributa, open to any citizen. Votes within these assemblies were counted by groups, variously defined, rather than by the individuals who made up these groups. Senators were chosen indirectly by the Comitia Centuriata and exercised significant power\u2014far more than the assemblies, which ostensibly represented all Roman citizens. By the 3rd century bce, all Roman citizens had been enfranchised, but the value of the voting right was related to wealth. Women lacked any voice in public life and had no voting rights, being at all times subject to the authority of a man, typically their father or husband. As Rome expanded across Italy, new subjects were allowed to govern their own affairs while enjoying most rights of Roman citizenship except the right to vote. Latin allies who moved to Rome permanently gained full citizenship. Allies bound to Rome by treaty did not enjoy full rights but were required to pay taxes or tribute as well as provide military service; these allies revolted against their inferior social status, leading to the Social War (90\u201389 bce), at the end of which full citizenship was given to all men of Italy, sans those who were enslaved, south of the Po River. The purpose of, and power wielded by, the comitia changed after the republic collapsed and was replaced by the Roman Empire in 27 bce. This Roman form of democracy became the basis for most modern representative democracies. The Italian city-states that rose up in the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire in western Europe, such as Venice and Florence, held elections for their leaders and called themselves republics, but they limited citizen participation to only a fraction of their male population. In medieval England, Simon de Montfort played a role in two parliaments that are considered important to the development of representative democracy. The first, in 1258, consisted of a group of barons who removed from King Henry III his unlimited powers through what was, in effect, England\u2019s first written constitution. The second, in 1265, included citizens from English towns. During the 17th century, Parliament opposed the power of the British monarch during the civil wars of 1642\u221251, and its passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689 made possible the Glorious Revolution, which rendered Parliament, and not the monarch, Great Britain\u2019s ruling power. The right to vote in Britain was expanded through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries, further reinforcing Parliament\u2019s power and underscoring the place of representative democracy in Britain. The United States and France are republics that have played an important role in the adoption and spread of representative democracy. Following the American Revolution, the United States adopted a new constitution in 1787 that adopted principles of representative democracy, with members of the House of Representatives directly elected by citizens with the right to vote. (Members of the Senate were elected indirectly until 1913.) Voting rights expanded over time to include women, men who did not own property, and Black people, among other groups. France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789, and the deputies that made up the short-lived National Convention were elected through universal male suffrage in 1792. Those voting rights subsequently eroded, however, until the revolution of 1848 resulted in their reinstatement; nearly a century later, suffrage was granted to women\n\nquestion: What is the government of the United States best described as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Representative democracy.", "usage": 1118}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Modern representative democracies have come into being through a variety of political institutions, most of which made their first appearance in Europe and the United States in the 18th century. The concept of representation is itself the most important, because it enables government officials who are elected by citizens to make major decisions and establish policies. Important institutions include: More than half of the world\u2019s countries are some form of representative democracy. Some are parliamentary constitutional monarchies, in which the head of state is a hereditary monarch and most or all political decisions and initiatives are the responsibility of an elected parliament. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands fall in this category. Countries such as Germany and India are federal parliamentary republics, which typically have a bicameral parliament. In a bicameral parliament, one of the houses (typically called the lower house) is directly elected by the country\u2019s citizens. The other house (the upper house) is elected by representatives of individual states or regions of the country. Since the regional representatives are in turn elected by citizens of those regions, the upper house is indirectly elected by the people. Federal parliamentary republics allow for each state or region to have a say in decisions made at the national, or federal, level. The United Kingdom also has a bicameral legislature, but the upper house, the House of Lords, is not an elected body, its members taking their positions by appointment or on account of a hereditary seat. France follows a semi-presidential republic model in which the president is a popularly (and directly) elected head of state, but the president\u2019s cabinet is responsible to an elected legislature, the National Assembly, which in turn supports the appointment of a prime minister. In contrast, the United States is a presidential republic system, in which the president is popularly elected and can appoint a cabinet but exists separately from elected federal legislative bodies (the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives). A representative democracy allows voters the opportunity to elect their preferred representative, who is then expected to follow the will of the electorate in making decisions. Thus citizens remove themselves from the strain of day-to-day decision making, while retaining the right to voice their opinions and to campaign or lobby for their points of view. Representatives can shape laws and policies in a way that gives the greatest benefit to the most people. However, once elected, representatives are not legally obligated to reflect the will of the people. The lure of political influence, monetary gain, and other factors can result in accusations of corruption or undue influence and damage the integrity of an elected institution. Elected representatives may choose to not honour their promises, safe in the knowledge that their position is secure until the next election. A disconnect from political processes can also lead to apathy among citizens, reducing their incentive to vote or otherwise participate in elections and other decision-making processes. Lastly, the election of representatives can deeply polarize citizens, especially in instances in which the election result was a narrow call, or disputed, leading to doubts over a representative\u2019s victory. In such cases, a significant portion of the population may feel unrepresented or neglected by the elected representative, resulting in citizens\u2019 apathy or in attempts by them to have their voices heard, such as protests or strikes.\n\nquestion: What is the government of the United States best described as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "presidential republic system", "usage": 738}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Nearly all modern Western-style democracies function as some type of representative democracy: for example, the United Kingdom (a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy), Germany (a federal parliamentary republic), France (a unitary semi-presidential republic), and the United States (a federal presidential republic). Representative democracy places power in the hands of representatives who are elected by the people. Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives). Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy. Representative democracy can be organized in different ways, including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber or two chambers. Where two chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways. The power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power: Theorists such as Edmund Burke believe that part of the duty of a representative was not simply to communicate the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters: Certainly, Gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a Representative, to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the Law and the Constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. The Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly. A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems. In Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments. The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns. Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries. The American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and Black people, and others not originally given voting rights, in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Until it was repealed by the Fourteenth Amendment following the Civil War, the Three-Fifths Compromise gave a disproportionate representation of slave states in the House of Representatives relative to the voters in free states. In 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all males in 1792. Universal male suffrage was re-established in France in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848. Representative democracy came into general favour particularly in post-industrial revolution nation states\n\nquestion: What is the government of the United States best described as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "a federal presidential republic", "usage": 1125}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Many historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern representative democracy in the United Kingdom. Globally, a majority of governments in the world are representative democracies, including constitutional monarchies and republics with strong representative branches. Separate but related, and very large, bodies of research in political philosophy and social science investigate how and how well elected representatives, such as legislators, represent the interests or preferences of one or another constituency. The empirical research shows that representative systems tend to be biased towards the representation of more affluent classes, to the detriment of the population at large. In his book Political Parties, written in 1911, Robert Michels argues that most representative systems deteriorate towards an oligarchy or particracy. This is known as the iron law of oligarchy. Representative democracies which are stable have been analysed by Adolf Gasser and compared to the unstable representative democracies in his book Gemeindefreiheit als Rettung Europas which was published in 1943 and a second edition in 1947. Adolf Gasser stated the following requirements for a representative democracy in order to remain stable, unaffected by the iron law of oligarchy: A drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance. Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized. Proponents of direct democracy criticize representative democracy due to its inherent structure. As the fundamental basis of representative democracy is non inclusive system, in which representatives turn into an elite class that works behind closed doors, as well as the criticizing the elector system as being driven by a capitalistic and authoritarian system. The system of stochocracy has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected. Stochocracy aims to at least reduce this degradation by having all representatives appointed by lottery instead of by voting. Therefore, this system is also called lottocracy. The system was proposed by the writer Roger de Sizif in 1998 in his book La Stochocratie. Choosing officeholders by lot was also the standard practice in ancient Athenian democracy and in ancient India. The rationale behind this practice was to avoid lobbying and electioneering by economic oligarchs. The system of deliberative democracy is a mix between a majority-ruled system and a consensus-based system. It allows for representative democracies or direct democracies to coexist with its system of governance, providing an initial advantage.\n\nquestion: What is the government of the United States best described as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "representative democracy", "usage": 648}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

What we eat, where we go to school, what kind of education we receive, how our tax money is spent, and what we do in our free time are all affected by government. Americans are often unaware of the pervasiveness of government in their everyday lives, and many are unsure precisely what it does. Here we will look at what government is, what it does, and how the government of the United States differs from other kinds of governments. The term government describes the means by which a society organizes itself and how it allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs. Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity, secure national borders, and the safety and well-being of citizens. Governments also provide benefits for their citizens. The type of benefits provided differ according to the country and their specific type of governmental system, but governments commonly provide such things as education, health care, and an infrastructure for transportation. The term politics refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals, especially those related to the division of resources within a nation. Sometimes governmental systems are confused with economic systems. This is because certain types of political thought or governmental organization are closely related to or develop with certain types of economic systems. For example, the economic system of capitalism in Western Europe and North America developed at roughly the same time as ideas about democratic republics, self-government, and natural rights. At this time, the idea of liberty became an important concept. According to John Locke, an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century, all people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed. In the eighteenth century, in Great Britain\u2019s North American colonies, and later in France, this developed into the idea that people should govern themselves through elected representatives and not a king; only those representatives chosen by the people had the right to make laws to govern them. Similarly, Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher who was born nineteen years after Locke\u2019s death, believed that all people should be free to acquire property in any way that they wished. Instead of being controlled by government, business, and industry, Smith argued, people should be allowed to operate as they wish and keep the proceeds of their work. Competition would ensure that prices remained low and faulty goods disappeared from the market. In this way, businesses would reap profits, consumers would have their needs satisfied, and society as a whole would prosper. Smith discussed these ideas, which formed the basis for industrial capitalism, in his book The Wealth of Nations, which was published in 1776, the same year that the Declaration of Independence was written. Representative government and capitalism developed together in the United States, and many Americans tend to equate democracy, a political system in which people govern themselves, with capitalism. In theory, a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled, for good or bad, by government. Capitalism, in turn, relies on individualism. At the same time, successful capitalists prefer political systems over which they can exert at least some influence in order to maintain their liberty. Democracy and capitalism do not have to go hand in hand, however. Indeed, one might argue that a capitalist economic system might be bad for democracy in some respects. Although Smith theorized that capitalism would lead to prosperity for all, this has not necessarily been the case. Great gaps in wealth between the owners of major businesses, industries, and financial institutions and those who work for others in exchange for wages exist in many capitalist nations. In turn, great wealth may give a very small minority great influence over the government\u2014a greater influence than that held by the majority of the population, which will be discussed later. Socialism is an alternative economic system. In socialist societies, the means of generating wealth, such as factories, large farms, and banks, are owned by the government and not by private individuals. The government accumulates wealth and then redistributes it to citizens, primarily in the form of social programs that provide such things as free or inexpensive health care, education, and childcare. In socialist countries, the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity, transportation systems like airlines and railroads, and telecommunications systems. In many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy: only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government. For example, in China, the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party. In the United States, the democratic government works closely together with its capitalist economic system. The interconnectedness of the two affects the way in which goods and services are distributed. The market provides many goods and services needed by Americans. For example, food, clothing, and housing are provided in ample supply by private businesses that earn a profit in return. These\n\nquestion: What do citizens of the country do in the United States system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "They govern themselves through elected representatives and not a king; only those representatives chosen by the people have the right to make laws to govern them.", "usage": 1135}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This, of course, is the ideal. In reality, those who live in poverty cannot always afford to buy ample food and clothing to meet their needs, or the food and clothing that they can afford to buy in abundance is of inferior quality. Also, it is often difficult to find adequate housing; housing in the most desirable neighborhoods\u2014those that have low crime rates and good schools\u2014is often too expensive for poor or working-class (and sometimes middle-class) people to buy or rent. Thus, the market cannot provide everything (in enough quantity or at low enough costs) in order to meet everyone\u2019s needs. Therefore, some goods are provided by the government. Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called public goods. Two such public goods are national security and education. It is difficult to see how a private business could protect the United States from attack. How could it build its own armies and create plans for defense and attack? Who would pay the men and women who served? Where would the intelligence come from? Due to its ability to tax, draw upon the resources of an entire nation, and compel citizen compliance, only government is capable of protecting the nation. Similarly, public schools provide education for all children in the United States. Children of all religions, races and ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, and levels of academic ability can attend public schools free of charge from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. It would be impossible for private schools to provide an education for all of the nation\u2019s children. Private schools do provide some education in the United States; however, they charge tuition, and only those parents who can afford to pay their fees (or whose children gain a scholarship) can attend these institutions. Some schools charge very high tuition, the equivalent to the tuition at a private college. If private schools were the only educational institutions, most poor and working-class children and many middle-class children would be uneducated. Private schooling is a type of good called a toll good. Toll goods are available to many people, and many people can make use of them, but only if they can pay the price. They occupy a middle ground between public and private goods. All parents may send their children to public schools in the United States. They can choose to send their children to a private school, but the private school will charge them. On the other hand, public schools, which are operated by the government, provide free education so all children can attend school. Therefore, everyone in the nation benefits from the educated voters and workers produced by the public school system. Another distinction between public and private goods is that public goods are available to all, typically without additional charge. What other public goods does government provide in the United States? At the federal, state, and local level, government provides stability and security, not only in the form of a military but also in the form of police and fire departments. Government provides other valuable goods and services such as public education, public transportation, mail service, and food, housing, and health care for the poor (Figure 1.2). If a house catches on fire, the fire department does not demand payment before they put the fire out. If someone breaks into a house and tries to harm the occupants, the police will try to protect them and arrest the intruder, but the police department will not request payment for services rendered. The provision of these goods and services is funded by citizens paying into the general tax base. Government also performs the important job of protecting common goods: goods that all people may use free of charge but that are of limited supply, such as fish in the sea or clean drinking water. Because everyone can use these goods, they must be protected so a few people do not take everything that is available and leave others with nothing. Some examples of common goods, private goods, public goods, and toll goods are listed below (Figure 1.3). This federal website shares information about the many services the government provides. One of the many important things government does is regulate public access to common goods like natural resources. Unlike public goods, which all people may use without charge, common goods are in limited supply. If more public schools are needed, the government can build more. If more firefighters or mail carriers are needed, the government can hire them. Public lands and wildlife, however, are not goods the government can simply multiply if supply falls due to demand. Indeed, if some people take too freely from the supply of common goods, there will not be enough left for others to use. Fish are one of the many common goods in which the government currently regulates access. It does so to ensure that certain species are not fished into extinction, thus depriving future generations of an important food source and a means to make a living. This idea is known as sustainability. Environmentalists want to set strict fishing limits on a variety of species. Commercial fishers resist these limits, claiming they are\n\nquestion: What do citizens of the country do in the United States system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1109}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Currently, fishing limits are set by a combination of scientists, politicians, local resource managers, and groups representing the interests of fishers.3 Should the government regulate fishing? Is it right to interfere with people\u2019s ability to earn money today in order to protect the access of future generations to the nation\u2019s common goods? Besides providing stability and goods and services for all, government also creates a structure by which goods and services can be made available to the people. In the United States, people elect representatives to city councils, state legislatures, and Congress. These bodies make laws to govern their respective jurisdictions. They also pass measures to raise money, through the imposition of taxes on such things as income, property, and sales. Local, state, and national governments also draft budgets to determine how the revenue taken in will be spent for services. On the local level, funds are allotted for education, police and fire departments, and maintenance of public parks. State governments allocate money for state colleges and universities, maintenance of state roads and bridges, and wildlife management, among other priorities. On the national level, money goes to such things as defense, Social Security, pensions for veterans, maintenance of federal courts and prisons, and management of national parks. At each level, representatives elected by the people try to secure funding for things that will benefit those who live in the areas they represent. Once money has been allocated, government agencies at each level then receive funds for the purposes mentioned above and use them to provide services to the public. Local, state, and national governments also make laws to maintain order and to ensure the efficient functioning of society, including the fair operation of the business marketplace. In the United States, for example, Congress passes laws regulating banking, and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories, the purity of food offered for sale, and the safety of toys and automobiles. In this way, government checks the actions of business, something that it would not do if capitalism in the United States functioned strictly in the manner that Adam Smith believed it should\u2026almost entirely unregulated. Besides providing goods to citizens and maintaining public safety, most governments also provide a means for citizens to participate in government and to make their opinions known to those in power. Western democracies like the United States, Britain, France, and others protect citizens\u2019 freedom of speech and the press. These nations, and others in the world, also allow citizens to vote. As noted earlier, politics is the process by which choices are made regarding how resources will be allocated and which economic and social policies government will pursue. Put more simply, politics is the process of who gets what and how. Politics involves choosing which values government will support and which it will not. If government chooses to support an ideal such as individualism, it may choose to loosen regulations on business and industry or to cut taxes so that people have more money to invest in business. If it chooses to support an ideal such as egalitarianism, which calls for equal treatment for all and the destruction of socioeconomic inequalities, it may raise taxes in order to be able to spend more on public education, public transportation, housing for the poor, and care for the elderly. If, for example, the government is more concerned with national security than with individual liberty, it may authorize the tapping of people\u2019s phones and restrict what newspapers may publish. If liberty is more important, then government will place greater restrictions on the extent that law enforcement agencies can intrude upon citizens\u2019 private communications. The political process and the input of citizens help determine the answer. Civic engagement, or the participation that connects citizens to government, is a vital ingredient of politics. In the United States, citizens play an important role in influencing what policies are pursued, what values the government chooses to support, what initiatives are granted funding, and who gets to make the final decisions. Political engagement can take many forms: reading about politics, listening to news reports, discussing politics, attending (or watching televised) political debates, donating money to political campaigns, handing out flyers promoting a candidate, voting, joining protest marches, and writing letters to their elected representatives. The government of the United States can best be described as a republic, or representative democracy. A democracy is a government in which political power\u2014influence over institutions, leaders, and policies\u2014rests in the hands of the people. In a representative democracy, however, the citizens do not govern directly. Instead, they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf. Most representative governments favor majority rule: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority. If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it\n\nquestion: What do citizens of the country do in the United States system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "They elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people.", "usage": 1126}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

However, in representative governments like the United States, minority rights are protected: people cannot be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be. For example, let\u2019s say American society decided that atheists, people who do not believe that God exists, were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country. Even though atheists only account for about 7 percent of the population, they would be protected due to minority rights.4 Even though the number of Americans who believe in God far outweighs the number who do not, the minority is still protected. Because decisions are made through majority rule, making your opinions known and voting for those men and women who make decisions that affect all of us are critical and influential forms of civic engagement in a representative democracy such as the United States. In a direct democracy, unlike representative democracy, people participate directly in making government decisions. For example, in ancient Athens, the most famous example of a direct democracy, all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly. Here they debated and voted for or against all proposed laws. Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy\u2014the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government\u2014some elements of direct democracy do exist in the United States. While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress, people may still directly vote on certain issues. For example, a referendum or proposed law might be placed on the ballot for citizens to vote on directly during state or local elections instead of leaving the matter in the hands of the state legislature. At New England town meetings, all residents are allowed to debate decisions affecting the town (Figure 1.5). Such occasions provide additional opportunities for civic engagement. Most countries now have some form of representative government.5 At the other end of the political spectrum are elite-driven forms of government. In a monarchy, one ruler, usually a hereditary ruler, holds political power. Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law, and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country, this is not always the case. Many southwest Asian kingdoms, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted. As discussed earlier, another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy, in which a handful of elite members of society, often those who belong to a particular political party, hold all political power. For example, in Cuba, as in China, only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office, and the party\u2019s most important members make all government decisions. Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature. Under totalitarianism, the government is more important than the citizens, and it controls all aspects of citizens\u2019 lives. Citizens\u2019 rights are limited, and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition. These forms of government are fairly rare. North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government. The CIA website provides information about the types of government across the world. As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.

The elected representatives are in turn accountable to the electorate for their actions. As a form of democracy, representative democracy exists in contrast to direct democracy, in which all citizens directly vote on laws to be passed and other issues. Most modern countries are representative democracies, and, as such, they face many challenges. Ancient Rome practiced the earliest known form of representative democracy in the Western world. The Romans called their state a republic (from the Latin respublica, meaning, literally, \u201ca thing that belongs to the people\u201d). During the era of the Roman Republic, which began in 509 bce, meetings were held in a public space, known as the forum, at the centre of each city within Roman territory. Citizenship was typically conferred by birth to all men if both parents were Roman citizens, though one of them, usually the mother, could be an alien with the right to contract a Roman marriage. Citizenship was also granted by naturalization and by manumission of enslaved people. As the republic evolved, Roman government came to have four assemblies along with the Senate, which had existed in various forms for centuries. The four assemblies, or comitia, were the Comitia Curiata, drawn from men claiming affiliation with one of several tribal groups (believed to be three groups originally created by Romulus); the Comitia Centuriata, made up of military units; the Concilium Plebis, consisting of plebeians; and the Comitia Tributa, open to any citizen. Votes within these assemblies were counted by groups, variously defined, rather than by the individuals who made up these groups. Senators were chosen indirectly by the Comitia Centuriata and exercised significant power\u2014far more than the assemblies, which ostensibly represented all Roman citizens. By the 3rd century bce, all Roman citizens had been enfranchised, but the value of the voting right was related to wealth. Women lacked any voice in public life and had no voting rights, being at all times subject to the authority of a man, typically their father or husband. As Rome expanded across Italy, new subjects were allowed to govern their own affairs while enjoying most rights of Roman citizenship except the right to vote. Latin allies who moved to Rome permanently gained full citizenship. Allies bound to Rome by treaty did not enjoy full rights but were required to pay taxes or tribute as well as provide military service; these allies revolted against their inferior social status, leading to the Social War (90\u201389 bce), at the end of which full citizenship was given to all men of Italy, sans those who were enslaved, south of the Po River. The purpose of, and power wielded by, the comitia changed after the republic collapsed and was replaced by the Roman Empire in 27 bce. This Roman form of democracy became the basis for most modern representative democracies. The Italian city-states that rose up in the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire in western Europe, such as Venice and Florence, held elections for their leaders and called themselves republics, but they limited citizen participation to only a fraction of their male population. In medieval England, Simon de Montfort played a role in two parliaments that are considered important to the development of representative democracy. The first, in 1258, consisted of a group of barons who removed from King Henry III his unlimited powers through what was, in effect, England\u2019s first written constitution. The second, in 1265, included citizens from English towns. During the 17th century, Parliament opposed the power of the British monarch during the civil wars of 1642\u221251, and its passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689 made possible the Glorious Revolution, which rendered Parliament, and not the monarch, Great Britain\u2019s ruling power. The right to vote in Britain was expanded through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries, further reinforcing Parliament\u2019s power and underscoring the place of representative democracy in Britain. The United States and France are republics that have played an important role in the adoption and spread of representative democracy. Following the American Revolution, the United States adopted a new constitution in 1787 that adopted principles of representative democracy, with members of the House of Representatives directly elected by citizens with the right to vote. (Members of the Senate were elected indirectly until 1913.) Voting rights expanded over time to include women, men who did not own property, and Black people, among other groups. France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789, and the deputies that made up the short-lived National Convention were elected through universal male suffrage in 1792. Those voting rights subsequently eroded, however, until the revolution of 1848 resulted in their reinstatement; nearly a century later, suffrage was granted to women\n\nquestion: What do citizens of the country do in the United States system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "vote for representatives", "usage": 1120}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Modern representative democracies have come into being through a variety of political institutions, most of which made their first appearance in Europe and the United States in the 18th century. The concept of representation is itself the most important, because it enables government officials who are elected by citizens to make major decisions and establish policies. Important institutions include: More than half of the world\u2019s countries are some form of representative democracy. Some are parliamentary constitutional monarchies, in which the head of state is a hereditary monarch and most or all political decisions and initiatives are the responsibility of an elected parliament. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands fall in this category. Countries such as Germany and India are federal parliamentary republics, which typically have a bicameral parliament. In a bicameral parliament, one of the houses (typically called the lower house) is directly elected by the country\u2019s citizens. The other house (the upper house) is elected by representatives of individual states or regions of the country. Since the regional representatives are in turn elected by citizens of those regions, the upper house is indirectly elected by the people. Federal parliamentary republics allow for each state or region to have a say in decisions made at the national, or federal, level. The United Kingdom also has a bicameral legislature, but the upper house, the House of Lords, is not an elected body, its members taking their positions by appointment or on account of a hereditary seat. France follows a semi-presidential republic model in which the president is a popularly (and directly) elected head of state, but the president\u2019s cabinet is responsible to an elected legislature, the National Assembly, which in turn supports the appointment of a prime minister. In contrast, the United States is a presidential republic system, in which the president is popularly elected and can appoint a cabinet but exists separately from elected federal legislative bodies (the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives). A representative democracy allows voters the opportunity to elect their preferred representative, who is then expected to follow the will of the electorate in making decisions. Thus citizens remove themselves from the strain of day-to-day decision making, while retaining the right to voice their opinions and to campaign or lobby for their points of view. Representatives can shape laws and policies in a way that gives the greatest benefit to the most people. However, once elected, representatives are not legally obligated to reflect the will of the people. The lure of political influence, monetary gain, and other factors can result in accusations of corruption or undue influence and damage the integrity of an elected institution. Elected representatives may choose to not honour their promises, safe in the knowledge that their position is secure until the next election. A disconnect from political processes can also lead to apathy among citizens, reducing their incentive to vote or otherwise participate in elections and other decision-making processes. Lastly, the election of representatives can deeply polarize citizens, especially in instances in which the election result was a narrow call, or disputed, leading to doubts over a representative\u2019s victory. In such cases, a significant portion of the population may feel unrepresented or neglected by the elected representative, resulting in citizens\u2019 apathy or in attempts by them to have their voices heard, such as protests or strikes.\n\nquestion: What do citizens of the country do in the United States system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The citizens vote for their preferred representatives.", "usage": 745}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Nearly all modern Western-style democracies function as some type of representative democracy: for example, the United Kingdom (a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy), Germany (a federal parliamentary republic), France (a unitary semi-presidential republic), and the United States (a federal presidential republic). Representative democracy places power in the hands of representatives who are elected by the people. Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives). Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy. Representative democracy can be organized in different ways, including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber or two chambers. Where two chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways. The power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power: Theorists such as Edmund Burke believe that part of the duty of a representative was not simply to communicate the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters: Certainly, Gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a Representative, to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the Law and the Constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. The Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly. A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems. In Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments. The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns. Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries. The American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and Black people, and others not originally given voting rights, in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Until it was repealed by the Fourteenth Amendment following the Civil War, the Three-Fifths Compromise gave a disproportionate representation of slave states in the House of Representatives relative to the voters in free states. In 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all males in 1792. Universal male suffrage was re-established in France in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848. Representative democracy came into general favour particularly in post-industrial revolution nation states\n\nquestion: What do citizens of the country do in the United States system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The citizens in the United States vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives.", "usage": 1140}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Many historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern representative democracy in the United Kingdom. Globally, a majority of governments in the world are representative democracies, including constitutional monarchies and republics with strong representative branches. Separate but related, and very large, bodies of research in political philosophy and social science investigate how and how well elected representatives, such as legislators, represent the interests or preferences of one or another constituency. The empirical research shows that representative systems tend to be biased towards the representation of more affluent classes, to the detriment of the population at large. In his book Political Parties, written in 1911, Robert Michels argues that most representative systems deteriorate towards an oligarchy or particracy. This is known as the iron law of oligarchy. Representative democracies which are stable have been analysed by Adolf Gasser and compared to the unstable representative democracies in his book Gemeindefreiheit als Rettung Europas which was published in 1943 and a second edition in 1947. Adolf Gasser stated the following requirements for a representative democracy in order to remain stable, unaffected by the iron law of oligarchy: A drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance. Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized. Proponents of direct democracy criticize representative democracy due to its inherent structure. As the fundamental basis of representative democracy is non inclusive system, in which representatives turn into an elite class that works behind closed doors, as well as the criticizing the elector system as being driven by a capitalistic and authoritarian system. The system of stochocracy has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected. Stochocracy aims to at least reduce this degradation by having all representatives appointed by lottery instead of by voting. Therefore, this system is also called lottocracy. The system was proposed by the writer Roger de Sizif in 1998 in his book La Stochocratie. Choosing officeholders by lot was also the standard practice in ancient Athenian democracy and in ancient India. The rationale behind this practice was to avoid lobbying and electioneering by economic oligarchs. The system of deliberative democracy is a mix between a majority-ruled system and a consensus-based system. It allows for representative democracies or direct democracies to coexist with its system of governance, providing an initial advantage.\n\nquestion: What do citizens of the country do in the United States system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 650}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

What we eat, where we go to school, what kind of education we receive, how our tax money is spent, and what we do in our free time are all affected by government. Americans are often unaware of the pervasiveness of government in their everyday lives, and many are unsure precisely what it does. Here we will look at what government is, what it does, and how the government of the United States differs from other kinds of governments. The term government describes the means by which a society organizes itself and how it allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs. Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity, secure national borders, and the safety and well-being of citizens. Governments also provide benefits for their citizens. The type of benefits provided differ according to the country and their specific type of governmental system, but governments commonly provide such things as education, health care, and an infrastructure for transportation. The term politics refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals, especially those related to the division of resources within a nation. Sometimes governmental systems are confused with economic systems. This is because certain types of political thought or governmental organization are closely related to or develop with certain types of economic systems. For example, the economic system of capitalism in Western Europe and North America developed at roughly the same time as ideas about democratic republics, self-government, and natural rights. At this time, the idea of liberty became an important concept. According to John Locke, an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century, all people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed. In the eighteenth century, in Great Britain\u2019s North American colonies, and later in France, this developed into the idea that people should govern themselves through elected representatives and not a king; only those representatives chosen by the people had the right to make laws to govern them. Similarly, Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher who was born nineteen years after Locke\u2019s death, believed that all people should be free to acquire property in any way that they wished. Instead of being controlled by government, business, and industry, Smith argued, people should be allowed to operate as they wish and keep the proceeds of their work. Competition would ensure that prices remained low and faulty goods disappeared from the market. In this way, businesses would reap profits, consumers would have their needs satisfied, and society as a whole would prosper. Smith discussed these ideas, which formed the basis for industrial capitalism, in his book The Wealth of Nations, which was published in 1776, the same year that the Declaration of Independence was written. Representative government and capitalism developed together in the United States, and many Americans tend to equate democracy, a political system in which people govern themselves, with capitalism. In theory, a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled, for good or bad, by government. Capitalism, in turn, relies on individualism. At the same time, successful capitalists prefer political systems over which they can exert at least some influence in order to maintain their liberty. Democracy and capitalism do not have to go hand in hand, however. Indeed, one might argue that a capitalist economic system might be bad for democracy in some respects. Although Smith theorized that capitalism would lead to prosperity for all, this has not necessarily been the case. Great gaps in wealth between the owners of major businesses, industries, and financial institutions and those who work for others in exchange for wages exist in many capitalist nations. In turn, great wealth may give a very small minority great influence over the government\u2014a greater influence than that held by the majority of the population, which will be discussed later. Socialism is an alternative economic system. In socialist societies, the means of generating wealth, such as factories, large farms, and banks, are owned by the government and not by private individuals. The government accumulates wealth and then redistributes it to citizens, primarily in the form of social programs that provide such things as free or inexpensive health care, education, and childcare. In socialist countries, the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity, transportation systems like airlines and railroads, and telecommunications systems. In many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy: only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government. For example, in China, the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party. In the United States, the democratic government works closely together with its capitalist economic system. The interconnectedness of the two affects the way in which goods and services are distributed. The market provides many goods and services needed by Americans. For example, food, clothing, and housing are provided in ample supply by private businesses that earn a profit in return. These\n\nquestion: What is the United States in terms of its system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "democratic government with a capitalist economic system", "usage": 1113}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This, of course, is the ideal. In reality, those who live in poverty cannot always afford to buy ample food and clothing to meet their needs, or the food and clothing that they can afford to buy in abundance is of inferior quality. Also, it is often difficult to find adequate housing; housing in the most desirable neighborhoods\u2014those that have low crime rates and good schools\u2014is often too expensive for poor or working-class (and sometimes middle-class) people to buy or rent. Thus, the market cannot provide everything (in enough quantity or at low enough costs) in order to meet everyone\u2019s needs. Therefore, some goods are provided by the government. Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called public goods. Two such public goods are national security and education. It is difficult to see how a private business could protect the United States from attack. How could it build its own armies and create plans for defense and attack? Who would pay the men and women who served? Where would the intelligence come from? Due to its ability to tax, draw upon the resources of an entire nation, and compel citizen compliance, only government is capable of protecting the nation. Similarly, public schools provide education for all children in the United States. Children of all religions, races and ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, and levels of academic ability can attend public schools free of charge from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. It would be impossible for private schools to provide an education for all of the nation\u2019s children. Private schools do provide some education in the United States; however, they charge tuition, and only those parents who can afford to pay their fees (or whose children gain a scholarship) can attend these institutions. Some schools charge very high tuition, the equivalent to the tuition at a private college. If private schools were the only educational institutions, most poor and working-class children and many middle-class children would be uneducated. Private schooling is a type of good called a toll good. Toll goods are available to many people, and many people can make use of them, but only if they can pay the price. They occupy a middle ground between public and private goods. All parents may send their children to public schools in the United States. They can choose to send their children to a private school, but the private school will charge them. On the other hand, public schools, which are operated by the government, provide free education so all children can attend school. Therefore, everyone in the nation benefits from the educated voters and workers produced by the public school system. Another distinction between public and private goods is that public goods are available to all, typically without additional charge. What other public goods does government provide in the United States? At the federal, state, and local level, government provides stability and security, not only in the form of a military but also in the form of police and fire departments. Government provides other valuable goods and services such as public education, public transportation, mail service, and food, housing, and health care for the poor (Figure 1.2). If a house catches on fire, the fire department does not demand payment before they put the fire out. If someone breaks into a house and tries to harm the occupants, the police will try to protect them and arrest the intruder, but the police department will not request payment for services rendered. The provision of these goods and services is funded by citizens paying into the general tax base. Government also performs the important job of protecting common goods: goods that all people may use free of charge but that are of limited supply, such as fish in the sea or clean drinking water. Because everyone can use these goods, they must be protected so a few people do not take everything that is available and leave others with nothing. Some examples of common goods, private goods, public goods, and toll goods are listed below (Figure 1.3). This federal website shares information about the many services the government provides. One of the many important things government does is regulate public access to common goods like natural resources. Unlike public goods, which all people may use without charge, common goods are in limited supply. If more public schools are needed, the government can build more. If more firefighters or mail carriers are needed, the government can hire them. Public lands and wildlife, however, are not goods the government can simply multiply if supply falls due to demand. Indeed, if some people take too freely from the supply of common goods, there will not be enough left for others to use. Fish are one of the many common goods in which the government currently regulates access. It does so to ensure that certain species are not fished into extinction, thus depriving future generations of an important food source and a means to make a living. This idea is known as sustainability. Environmentalists want to set strict fishing limits on a variety of species. Commercial fishers resist these limits, claiming they are\n\nquestion: What is the United States in terms of its system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "A Representative Democracy", "usage": 1108}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Currently, fishing limits are set by a combination of scientists, politicians, local resource managers, and groups representing the interests of fishers.3 Should the government regulate fishing? Is it right to interfere with people\u2019s ability to earn money today in order to protect the access of future generations to the nation\u2019s common goods? Besides providing stability and goods and services for all, government also creates a structure by which goods and services can be made available to the people. In the United States, people elect representatives to city councils, state legislatures, and Congress. These bodies make laws to govern their respective jurisdictions. They also pass measures to raise money, through the imposition of taxes on such things as income, property, and sales. Local, state, and national governments also draft budgets to determine how the revenue taken in will be spent for services. On the local level, funds are allotted for education, police and fire departments, and maintenance of public parks. State governments allocate money for state colleges and universities, maintenance of state roads and bridges, and wildlife management, among other priorities. On the national level, money goes to such things as defense, Social Security, pensions for veterans, maintenance of federal courts and prisons, and management of national parks. At each level, representatives elected by the people try to secure funding for things that will benefit those who live in the areas they represent. Once money has been allocated, government agencies at each level then receive funds for the purposes mentioned above and use them to provide services to the public. Local, state, and national governments also make laws to maintain order and to ensure the efficient functioning of society, including the fair operation of the business marketplace. In the United States, for example, Congress passes laws regulating banking, and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories, the purity of food offered for sale, and the safety of toys and automobiles. In this way, government checks the actions of business, something that it would not do if capitalism in the United States functioned strictly in the manner that Adam Smith believed it should\u2026almost entirely unregulated. Besides providing goods to citizens and maintaining public safety, most governments also provide a means for citizens to participate in government and to make their opinions known to those in power. Western democracies like the United States, Britain, France, and others protect citizens\u2019 freedom of speech and the press. These nations, and others in the world, also allow citizens to vote. As noted earlier, politics is the process by which choices are made regarding how resources will be allocated and which economic and social policies government will pursue. Put more simply, politics is the process of who gets what and how. Politics involves choosing which values government will support and which it will not. If government chooses to support an ideal such as individualism, it may choose to loosen regulations on business and industry or to cut taxes so that people have more money to invest in business. If it chooses to support an ideal such as egalitarianism, which calls for equal treatment for all and the destruction of socioeconomic inequalities, it may raise taxes in order to be able to spend more on public education, public transportation, housing for the poor, and care for the elderly. If, for example, the government is more concerned with national security than with individual liberty, it may authorize the tapping of people\u2019s phones and restrict what newspapers may publish. If liberty is more important, then government will place greater restrictions on the extent that law enforcement agencies can intrude upon citizens\u2019 private communications. The political process and the input of citizens help determine the answer. Civic engagement, or the participation that connects citizens to government, is a vital ingredient of politics. In the United States, citizens play an important role in influencing what policies are pursued, what values the government chooses to support, what initiatives are granted funding, and who gets to make the final decisions. Political engagement can take many forms: reading about politics, listening to news reports, discussing politics, attending (or watching televised) political debates, donating money to political campaigns, handing out flyers promoting a candidate, voting, joining protest marches, and writing letters to their elected representatives. The government of the United States can best be described as a republic, or representative democracy. A democracy is a government in which political power\u2014influence over institutions, leaders, and policies\u2014rests in the hands of the people. In a representative democracy, however, the citizens do not govern directly. Instead, they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf. Most representative governments favor majority rule: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority. If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it\n\nquestion: What is the United States in terms of its system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "A republic or representative democracy.", "usage": 1114}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

However, in representative governments like the United States, minority rights are protected: people cannot be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be. For example, let\u2019s say American society decided that atheists, people who do not believe that God exists, were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country. Even though atheists only account for about 7 percent of the population, they would be protected due to minority rights.4 Even though the number of Americans who believe in God far outweighs the number who do not, the minority is still protected. Because decisions are made through majority rule, making your opinions known and voting for those men and women who make decisions that affect all of us are critical and influential forms of civic engagement in a representative democracy such as the United States. In a direct democracy, unlike representative democracy, people participate directly in making government decisions. For example, in ancient Athens, the most famous example of a direct democracy, all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly. Here they debated and voted for or against all proposed laws. Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy\u2014the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government\u2014some elements of direct democracy do exist in the United States. While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress, people may still directly vote on certain issues. For example, a referendum or proposed law might be placed on the ballot for citizens to vote on directly during state or local elections instead of leaving the matter in the hands of the state legislature. At New England town meetings, all residents are allowed to debate decisions affecting the town (Figure 1.5). Such occasions provide additional opportunities for civic engagement. Most countries now have some form of representative government.5 At the other end of the political spectrum are elite-driven forms of government. In a monarchy, one ruler, usually a hereditary ruler, holds political power. Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law, and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country, this is not always the case. Many southwest Asian kingdoms, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted. As discussed earlier, another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy, in which a handful of elite members of society, often those who belong to a particular political party, hold all political power. For example, in Cuba, as in China, only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office, and the party\u2019s most important members make all government decisions. Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature. Under totalitarianism, the government is more important than the citizens, and it controls all aspects of citizens\u2019 lives. Citizens\u2019 rights are limited, and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition. These forms of government are fairly rare. North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government. The CIA website provides information about the types of government across the world. As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.

The elected representatives are in turn accountable to the electorate for their actions. As a form of democracy, representative democracy exists in contrast to direct democracy, in which all citizens directly vote on laws to be passed and other issues. Most modern countries are representative democracies, and, as such, they face many challenges. Ancient Rome practiced the earliest known form of representative democracy in the Western world. The Romans called their state a republic (from the Latin respublica, meaning, literally, \u201ca thing that belongs to the people\u201d). During the era of the Roman Republic, which began in 509 bce, meetings were held in a public space, known as the forum, at the centre of each city within Roman territory. Citizenship was typically conferred by birth to all men if both parents were Roman citizens, though one of them, usually the mother, could be an alien with the right to contract a Roman marriage. Citizenship was also granted by naturalization and by manumission of enslaved people. As the republic evolved, Roman government came to have four assemblies along with the Senate, which had existed in various forms for centuries. The four assemblies, or comitia, were the Comitia Curiata, drawn from men claiming affiliation with one of several tribal groups (believed to be three groups originally created by Romulus); the Comitia Centuriata, made up of military units; the Concilium Plebis, consisting of plebeians; and the Comitia Tributa, open to any citizen. Votes within these assemblies were counted by groups, variously defined, rather than by the individuals who made up these groups. Senators were chosen indirectly by the Comitia Centuriata and exercised significant power\u2014far more than the assemblies, which ostensibly represented all Roman citizens. By the 3rd century bce, all Roman citizens had been enfranchised, but the value of the voting right was related to wealth. Women lacked any voice in public life and had no voting rights, being at all times subject to the authority of a man, typically their father or husband. As Rome expanded across Italy, new subjects were allowed to govern their own affairs while enjoying most rights of Roman citizenship except the right to vote. Latin allies who moved to Rome permanently gained full citizenship. Allies bound to Rome by treaty did not enjoy full rights but were required to pay taxes or tribute as well as provide military service; these allies revolted against their inferior social status, leading to the Social War (90\u201389 bce), at the end of which full citizenship was given to all men of Italy, sans those who were enslaved, south of the Po River. The purpose of, and power wielded by, the comitia changed after the republic collapsed and was replaced by the Roman Empire in 27 bce. This Roman form of democracy became the basis for most modern representative democracies. The Italian city-states that rose up in the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire in western Europe, such as Venice and Florence, held elections for their leaders and called themselves republics, but they limited citizen participation to only a fraction of their male population. In medieval England, Simon de Montfort played a role in two parliaments that are considered important to the development of representative democracy. The first, in 1258, consisted of a group of barons who removed from King Henry III his unlimited powers through what was, in effect, England\u2019s first written constitution. The second, in 1265, included citizens from English towns. During the 17th century, Parliament opposed the power of the British monarch during the civil wars of 1642\u221251, and its passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689 made possible the Glorious Revolution, which rendered Parliament, and not the monarch, Great Britain\u2019s ruling power. The right to vote in Britain was expanded through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries, further reinforcing Parliament\u2019s power and underscoring the place of representative democracy in Britain. The United States and France are republics that have played an important role in the adoption and spread of representative democracy. Following the American Revolution, the United States adopted a new constitution in 1787 that adopted principles of representative democracy, with members of the House of Representatives directly elected by citizens with the right to vote. (Members of the Senate were elected indirectly until 1913.) Voting rights expanded over time to include women, men who did not own property, and Black people, among other groups. France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789, and the deputies that made up the short-lived National Convention were elected through universal male suffrage in 1792. Those voting rights subsequently eroded, however, until the revolution of 1848 resulted in their reinstatement; nearly a century later, suffrage was granted to women\n\nquestion: What is the United States in terms of its system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "representative democracy", "usage": 1118}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Modern representative democracies have come into being through a variety of political institutions, most of which made their first appearance in Europe and the United States in the 18th century. The concept of representation is itself the most important, because it enables government officials who are elected by citizens to make major decisions and establish policies. Important institutions include: More than half of the world\u2019s countries are some form of representative democracy. Some are parliamentary constitutional monarchies, in which the head of state is a hereditary monarch and most or all political decisions and initiatives are the responsibility of an elected parliament. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands fall in this category. Countries such as Germany and India are federal parliamentary republics, which typically have a bicameral parliament. In a bicameral parliament, one of the houses (typically called the lower house) is directly elected by the country\u2019s citizens. The other house (the upper house) is elected by representatives of individual states or regions of the country. Since the regional representatives are in turn elected by citizens of those regions, the upper house is indirectly elected by the people. Federal parliamentary republics allow for each state or region to have a say in decisions made at the national, or federal, level. The United Kingdom also has a bicameral legislature, but the upper house, the House of Lords, is not an elected body, its members taking their positions by appointment or on account of a hereditary seat. France follows a semi-presidential republic model in which the president is a popularly (and directly) elected head of state, but the president\u2019s cabinet is responsible to an elected legislature, the National Assembly, which in turn supports the appointment of a prime minister. In contrast, the United States is a presidential republic system, in which the president is popularly elected and can appoint a cabinet but exists separately from elected federal legislative bodies (the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives). A representative democracy allows voters the opportunity to elect their preferred representative, who is then expected to follow the will of the electorate in making decisions. Thus citizens remove themselves from the strain of day-to-day decision making, while retaining the right to voice their opinions and to campaign or lobby for their points of view. Representatives can shape laws and policies in a way that gives the greatest benefit to the most people. However, once elected, representatives are not legally obligated to reflect the will of the people. The lure of political influence, monetary gain, and other factors can result in accusations of corruption or undue influence and damage the integrity of an elected institution. Elected representatives may choose to not honour their promises, safe in the knowledge that their position is secure until the next election. A disconnect from political processes can also lead to apathy among citizens, reducing their incentive to vote or otherwise participate in elections and other decision-making processes. Lastly, the election of representatives can deeply polarize citizens, especially in instances in which the election result was a narrow call, or disputed, leading to doubts over a representative\u2019s victory. In such cases, a significant portion of the population may feel unrepresented or neglected by the elected representative, resulting in citizens\u2019 apathy or in attempts by them to have their voices heard, such as protests or strikes.\n\nquestion: What is the United States in terms of its system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "presidential republic system", "usage": 739}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Nearly all modern Western-style democracies function as some type of representative democracy: for example, the United Kingdom (a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy), Germany (a federal parliamentary republic), France (a unitary semi-presidential republic), and the United States (a federal presidential republic). Representative democracy places power in the hands of representatives who are elected by the people. Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives). Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy. Representative democracy can be organized in different ways, including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber or two chambers. Where two chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways. The power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power: Theorists such as Edmund Burke believe that part of the duty of a representative was not simply to communicate the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters: Certainly, Gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a Representative, to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the Law and the Constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. The Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly. A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems. In Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments. The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns. Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries. The American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and Black people, and others not originally given voting rights, in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Until it was repealed by the Fourteenth Amendment following the Civil War, the Three-Fifths Compromise gave a disproportionate representation of slave states in the House of Representatives relative to the voters in free states. In 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all males in 1792. Universal male suffrage was re-established in France in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848. Representative democracy came into general favour particularly in post-industrial revolution nation states\n\nquestion: What is the United States in terms of its system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "federal presidential republic", "usage": 1126}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Many historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern representative democracy in the United Kingdom. Globally, a majority of governments in the world are representative democracies, including constitutional monarchies and republics with strong representative branches. Separate but related, and very large, bodies of research in political philosophy and social science investigate how and how well elected representatives, such as legislators, represent the interests or preferences of one or another constituency. The empirical research shows that representative systems tend to be biased towards the representation of more affluent classes, to the detriment of the population at large. In his book Political Parties, written in 1911, Robert Michels argues that most representative systems deteriorate towards an oligarchy or particracy. This is known as the iron law of oligarchy. Representative democracies which are stable have been analysed by Adolf Gasser and compared to the unstable representative democracies in his book Gemeindefreiheit als Rettung Europas which was published in 1943 and a second edition in 1947. Adolf Gasser stated the following requirements for a representative democracy in order to remain stable, unaffected by the iron law of oligarchy: A drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance. Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized. Proponents of direct democracy criticize representative democracy due to its inherent structure. As the fundamental basis of representative democracy is non inclusive system, in which representatives turn into an elite class that works behind closed doors, as well as the criticizing the elector system as being driven by a capitalistic and authoritarian system. The system of stochocracy has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected. Stochocracy aims to at least reduce this degradation by having all representatives appointed by lottery instead of by voting. Therefore, this system is also called lottocracy. The system was proposed by the writer Roger de Sizif in 1998 in his book La Stochocratie. Choosing officeholders by lot was also the standard practice in ancient Athenian democracy and in ancient India. The rationale behind this practice was to avoid lobbying and electioneering by economic oligarchs. The system of deliberative democracy is a mix between a majority-ruled system and a consensus-based system. It allows for representative democracies or direct democracies to coexist with its system of governance, providing an initial advantage.\n\nquestion: What is the United States in terms of its system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "representative democracy", "usage": 649}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

What we eat, where we go to school, what kind of education we receive, how our tax money is spent, and what we do in our free time are all affected by government. Americans are often unaware of the pervasiveness of government in their everyday lives, and many are unsure precisely what it does. Here we will look at what government is, what it does, and how the government of the United States differs from other kinds of governments. The term government describes the means by which a society organizes itself and how it allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs. Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity, secure national borders, and the safety and well-being of citizens. Governments also provide benefits for their citizens. The type of benefits provided differ according to the country and their specific type of governmental system, but governments commonly provide such things as education, health care, and an infrastructure for transportation. The term politics refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals, especially those related to the division of resources within a nation. Sometimes governmental systems are confused with economic systems. This is because certain types of political thought or governmental organization are closely related to or develop with certain types of economic systems. For example, the economic system of capitalism in Western Europe and North America developed at roughly the same time as ideas about democratic republics, self-government, and natural rights. At this time, the idea of liberty became an important concept. According to John Locke, an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century, all people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed. In the eighteenth century, in Great Britain\u2019s North American colonies, and later in France, this developed into the idea that people should govern themselves through elected representatives and not a king; only those representatives chosen by the people had the right to make laws to govern them. Similarly, Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher who was born nineteen years after Locke\u2019s death, believed that all people should be free to acquire property in any way that they wished. Instead of being controlled by government, business, and industry, Smith argued, people should be allowed to operate as they wish and keep the proceeds of their work. Competition would ensure that prices remained low and faulty goods disappeared from the market. In this way, businesses would reap profits, consumers would have their needs satisfied, and society as a whole would prosper. Smith discussed these ideas, which formed the basis for industrial capitalism, in his book The Wealth of Nations, which was published in 1776, the same year that the Declaration of Independence was written. Representative government and capitalism developed together in the United States, and many Americans tend to equate democracy, a political system in which people govern themselves, with capitalism. In theory, a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled, for good or bad, by government. Capitalism, in turn, relies on individualism. At the same time, successful capitalists prefer political systems over which they can exert at least some influence in order to maintain their liberty. Democracy and capitalism do not have to go hand in hand, however. Indeed, one might argue that a capitalist economic system might be bad for democracy in some respects. Although Smith theorized that capitalism would lead to prosperity for all, this has not necessarily been the case. Great gaps in wealth between the owners of major businesses, industries, and financial institutions and those who work for others in exchange for wages exist in many capitalist nations. In turn, great wealth may give a very small minority great influence over the government\u2014a greater influence than that held by the majority of the population, which will be discussed later. Socialism is an alternative economic system. In socialist societies, the means of generating wealth, such as factories, large farms, and banks, are owned by the government and not by private individuals. The government accumulates wealth and then redistributes it to citizens, primarily in the form of social programs that provide such things as free or inexpensive health care, education, and childcare. In socialist countries, the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity, transportation systems like airlines and railroads, and telecommunications systems. In many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy: only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government. For example, in China, the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party. In the United States, the democratic government works closely together with its capitalist economic system. The interconnectedness of the two affects the way in which goods and services are distributed. The market provides many goods and services needed by Americans. For example, food, clothing, and housing are provided in ample supply by private businesses that earn a profit in return.

This, of course, is the ideal. In reality, those who live in poverty cannot always afford to buy ample food and clothing to meet their needs, or the food and clothing that they can afford to buy in abundance is of inferior quality. Also, it is often difficult to find adequate housing; housing in the most desirable neighborhoods\u2014those that have low crime rates and good schools\u2014is often too expensive for poor or working-class (and sometimes middle-class) people to buy or rent. Thus, the market cannot provide everything (in enough quantity or at low enough costs) in order to meet everyone\u2019s needs. Therefore, some goods are provided by the government. Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called public goods. Two such public goods are national security and education. It is difficult to see how a private business could protect the United States from attack. How could it build its own armies and create plans for defense and attack? Who would pay the men and women who served? Where would the intelligence come from? Due to its ability to tax, draw upon the resources of an entire nation, and compel citizen compliance, only government is capable of protecting the nation. Similarly, public schools provide education for all children in the United States. Children of all religions, races and ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, and levels of academic ability can attend public schools free of charge from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. It would be impossible for private schools to provide an education for all of the nation\u2019s children. Private schools do provide some education in the United States; however, they charge tuition, and only those parents who can afford to pay their fees (or whose children gain a scholarship) can attend these institutions. Some schools charge very high tuition, the equivalent to the tuition at a private college. If private schools were the only educational institutions, most poor and working-class children and many middle-class children would be uneducated. Private schooling is a type of good called a toll good. Toll goods are available to many people, and many people can make use of them, but only if they can pay the price. They occupy a middle ground between public and private goods. All parents may send their children to public schools in the United States. They can choose to send their children to a private school, but the private school will charge them. On the other hand, public schools, which are operated by the government, provide free education so all children can attend school. Therefore, everyone in the nation benefits from the educated voters and workers produced by the public school system. Another distinction between public and private goods is that public goods are available to all, typically without additional charge. What other public goods does government provide in the United States? At the federal, state, and local level, government provides stability and security, not only in the form of a military but also in the form of police and fire departments. Government provides other valuable goods and services such as public education, public transportation, mail service, and food, housing, and health care for the poor (Figure 1.2). If a house catches on fire, the fire department does not demand payment before they put the fire out. If someone breaks into a house and tries to harm the occupants, the police will try to protect them and arrest the intruder, but the police department will not request payment for services rendered. The provision of these goods and services is funded by citizens paying into the general tax base. Government also performs the important job of protecting common goods: goods that all people may use free of charge but that are of limited supply, such as fish in the sea or clean drinking water. Because everyone can use these goods, they must be protected so a few people do not take everything that is available and leave others with nothing. Some examples of common goods, private goods, public goods, and toll goods are listed below (Figure 1.3). This federal website shares information about the many services the government provides. One of the many important things government does is regulate public access to common goods like natural resources. Unlike public goods, which all people may use without charge, common goods are in limited supply. If more public schools are needed, the government can build more. If more firefighters or mail carriers are needed, the government can hire them. Public lands and wildlife, however, are not goods the government can simply multiply if supply falls due to demand. Indeed, if some people take too freely from the supply of common goods, there will not be enough left for others to use. Fish are one of the many common goods in which the government currently regulates access. It does so to ensure that certain species are not fished into extinction, thus depriving future generations of an important food source and a means to make a living. This idea is known as sustainability. Environmentalists want to set strict fishing limits on a variety of species. Commercial fishers resist these limits, claiming they are\n\nquestion: How is power placed in the United States system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1106}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Currently, fishing limits are set by a combination of scientists, politicians, local resource managers, and groups representing the interests of fishers.3 Should the government regulate fishing? Is it right to interfere with people\u2019s ability to earn money today in order to protect the access of future generations to the nation\u2019s common goods? Besides providing stability and goods and services for all, government also creates a structure by which goods and services can be made available to the people. In the United States, people elect representatives to city councils, state legislatures, and Congress. These bodies make laws to govern their respective jurisdictions. They also pass measures to raise money, through the imposition of taxes on such things as income, property, and sales. Local, state, and national governments also draft budgets to determine how the revenue taken in will be spent for services. On the local level, funds are allotted for education, police and fire departments, and maintenance of public parks. State governments allocate money for state colleges and universities, maintenance of state roads and bridges, and wildlife management, among other priorities. On the national level, money goes to such things as defense, Social Security, pensions for veterans, maintenance of federal courts and prisons, and management of national parks. At each level, representatives elected by the people try to secure funding for things that will benefit those who live in the areas they represent. Once money has been allocated, government agencies at each level then receive funds for the purposes mentioned above and use them to provide services to the public. Local, state, and national governments also make laws to maintain order and to ensure the efficient functioning of society, including the fair operation of the business marketplace. In the United States, for example, Congress passes laws regulating banking, and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories, the purity of food offered for sale, and the safety of toys and automobiles. In this way, government checks the actions of business, something that it would not do if capitalism in the United States functioned strictly in the manner that Adam Smith believed it should\u2026almost entirely unregulated. Besides providing goods to citizens and maintaining public safety, most governments also provide a means for citizens to participate in government and to make their opinions known to those in power. Western democracies like the United States, Britain, France, and others protect citizens\u2019 freedom of speech and the press. These nations, and others in the world, also allow citizens to vote. As noted earlier, politics is the process by which choices are made regarding how resources will be allocated and which economic and social policies government will pursue. Put more simply, politics is the process of who gets what and how. Politics involves choosing which values government will support and which it will not. If government chooses to support an ideal such as individualism, it may choose to loosen regulations on business and industry or to cut taxes so that people have more money to invest in business. If it chooses to support an ideal such as egalitarianism, which calls for equal treatment for all and the destruction of socioeconomic inequalities, it may raise taxes in order to be able to spend more on public education, public transportation, housing for the poor, and care for the elderly. If, for example, the government is more concerned with national security than with individual liberty, it may authorize the tapping of people\u2019s phones and restrict what newspapers may publish. If liberty is more important, then government will place greater restrictions on the extent that law enforcement agencies can intrude upon citizens\u2019 private communications. The political process and the input of citizens help determine the answer. Civic engagement, or the participation that connects citizens to government, is a vital ingredient of politics. In the United States, citizens play an important role in influencing what policies are pursued, what values the government chooses to support, what initiatives are granted funding, and who gets to make the final decisions. Political engagement can take many forms: reading about politics, listening to news reports, discussing politics, attending (or watching televised) political debates, donating money to political campaigns, handing out flyers promoting a candidate, voting, joining protest marches, and writing letters to their elected representatives. The government of the United States can best be described as a republic, or representative democracy. A democracy is a government in which political power\u2014influence over institutions, leaders, and policies\u2014rests in the hands of the people. In a representative democracy, however, the citizens do not govern directly. Instead, they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf. Most representative governments favor majority rule: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority. If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it\n\nquestion: How is power placed in the United States system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "A republic or representative democracy.", "usage": 1113}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The United States Government: A Representative Democracy\n\nevidence: , the law will be enacted. However, in representative governments like the United States, minority rights are protected: people cannot be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be. For example, let\u2019s say American society decided that atheists, people who do not believe that God exists, were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country. Even though atheists only account for about 7 percent of the population, they would be protected due to minority rights.4 Even though the number of Americans who believe in God far outweighs the number who do not, the minority is still protected. Because decisions are made through majority rule, making your opinions known and voting for those men and women who make decisions that affect all of us are critical and influential forms of civic engagement in a representative democracy such as the United States. In a direct democracy, unlike representative democracy, people participate directly in making government decisions. For example, in ancient Athens, the most famous example of a direct democracy, all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly. Here they debated and voted for or against all proposed laws. Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy\u2014the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government\u2014some elements of direct democracy do exist in the United States. While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress, people may still directly vote on certain issues. For example, a referendum or proposed law might be placed on the ballot for citizens to vote on directly during state or local elections instead of leaving the matter in the hands of the state legislature. At New England town meetings, all residents are allowed to debate decisions affecting the town (Figure 1.5). Such occasions provide additional opportunities for civic engagement. Most countries now have some form of representative government.5 At the other end of the political spectrum are elite-driven forms of government. In a monarchy, one ruler, usually a hereditary ruler, holds political power. Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law, and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country, this is not always the case. Many southwest Asian kingdoms, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted. As discussed earlier, another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy, in which a handful of elite members of society, often those who belong to a particular political party, hold all political power. For example, in Cuba, as in China, only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office, and the party\u2019s most important members make all government decisions. Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature. Under totalitarianism, the government is more important than the citizens, and it controls all aspects of citizens\u2019 lives. Citizens\u2019 rights are limited, and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition. These forms of government are fairly rare. North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government. The CIA website provides information about the types of government across the world. As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.

The elected representatives are in turn accountable to the electorate for their actions. As a form of democracy, representative democracy exists in contrast to direct democracy, in which all citizens directly vote on laws to be passed and other issues. Most modern countries are representative democracies, and, as such, they face many challenges. Ancient Rome practiced the earliest known form of representative democracy in the Western world. The Romans called their state a republic (from the Latin respublica, meaning, literally, \u201ca thing that belongs to the people\u201d). During the era of the Roman Republic, which began in 509 bce, meetings were held in a public space, known as the forum, at the centre of each city within Roman territory. Citizenship was typically conferred by birth to all men if both parents were Roman citizens, though one of them, usually the mother, could be an alien with the right to contract a Roman marriage. Citizenship was also granted by naturalization and by manumission of enslaved people. As the republic evolved, Roman government came to have four assemblies along with the Senate, which had existed in various forms for centuries. The four assemblies, or comitia, were the Comitia Curiata, drawn from men claiming affiliation with one of several tribal groups (believed to be three groups originally created by Romulus); the Comitia Centuriata, made up of military units; the Concilium Plebis, consisting of plebeians; and the Comitia Tributa, open to any citizen. Votes within these assemblies were counted by groups, variously defined, rather than by the individuals who made up these groups. Senators were chosen indirectly by the Comitia Centuriata and exercised significant power\u2014far more than the assemblies, which ostensibly represented all Roman citizens. By the 3rd century bce, all Roman citizens had been enfranchised, but the value of the voting right was related to wealth. Women lacked any voice in public life and had no voting rights, being at all times subject to the authority of a man, typically their father or husband. As Rome expanded across Italy, new subjects were allowed to govern their own affairs while enjoying most rights of Roman citizenship except the right to vote. Latin allies who moved to Rome permanently gained full citizenship. Allies bound to Rome by treaty did not enjoy full rights but were required to pay taxes or tribute as well as provide military service; these allies revolted against their inferior social status, leading to the Social War (90\u201389 bce), at the end of which full citizenship was given to all men of Italy, sans those who were enslaved, south of the Po River. The purpose of, and power wielded by, the comitia changed after the republic collapsed and was replaced by the Roman Empire in 27 bce. This Roman form of democracy became the basis for most modern representative democracies. The Italian city-states that rose up in the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire in western Europe, such as Venice and Florence, held elections for their leaders and called themselves republics, but they limited citizen participation to only a fraction of their male population. In medieval England, Simon de Montfort played a role in two parliaments that are considered important to the development of representative democracy. The first, in 1258, consisted of a group of barons who removed from King Henry III his unlimited powers through what was, in effect, England\u2019s first written constitution. The second, in 1265, included citizens from English towns. During the 17th century, Parliament opposed the power of the British monarch during the civil wars of 1642\u221251, and its passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689 made possible the Glorious Revolution, which rendered Parliament, and not the monarch, Great Britain\u2019s ruling power. The right to vote in Britain was expanded through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries, further reinforcing Parliament\u2019s power and underscoring the place of representative democracy in Britain. The United States and France are republics that have played an important role in the adoption and spread of representative democracy. Following the American Revolution, the United States adopted a new constitution in 1787 that adopted principles of representative democracy, with members of the House of Representatives directly elected by citizens with the right to vote. (Members of the Senate were elected indirectly until 1913.) Voting rights expanded over time to include women, men who did not own property, and Black people, among other groups. France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789, and the deputies that made up the short-lived National Convention were elected through universal male suffrage in 1792. Those voting rights subsequently eroded, however, until the revolution of 1848 resulted in their reinstatement; nearly a century later, suffrage was granted to women\n\nquestion: How is power placed in the United States system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Members of the House of Representatives are directly elected by citizens.", "usage": 1126}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Modern representative democracies have come into being through a variety of political institutions, most of which made their first appearance in Europe and the United States in the 18th century. The concept of representation is itself the most important, because it enables government officials who are elected by citizens to make major decisions and establish policies. Important institutions include: More than half of the world\u2019s countries are some form of representative democracy. Some are parliamentary constitutional monarchies, in which the head of state is a hereditary monarch and most or all political decisions and initiatives are the responsibility of an elected parliament. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands fall in this category. Countries such as Germany and India are federal parliamentary republics, which typically have a bicameral parliament. In a bicameral parliament, one of the houses (typically called the lower house) is directly elected by the country\u2019s citizens. The other house (the upper house) is elected by representatives of individual states or regions of the country. Since the regional representatives are in turn elected by citizens of those regions, the upper house is indirectly elected by the people. Federal parliamentary republics allow for each state or region to have a say in decisions made at the national, or federal, level. The United Kingdom also has a bicameral legislature, but the upper house, the House of Lords, is not an elected body, its members taking their positions by appointment or on account of a hereditary seat. France follows a semi-presidential republic model in which the president is a popularly (and directly) elected head of state, but the president\u2019s cabinet is responsible to an elected legislature, the National Assembly, which in turn supports the appointment of a prime minister. In contrast, the United States is a presidential republic system, in which the president is popularly elected and can appoint a cabinet but exists separately from elected federal legislative bodies (the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives). A representative democracy allows voters the opportunity to elect their preferred representative, who is then expected to follow the will of the electorate in making decisions. Thus citizens remove themselves from the strain of day-to-day decision making, while retaining the right to voice their opinions and to campaign or lobby for their points of view. Representatives can shape laws and policies in a way that gives the greatest benefit to the most people. However, once elected, representatives are not legally obligated to reflect the will of the people. The lure of political influence, monetary gain, and other factors can result in accusations of corruption or undue influence and damage the integrity of an elected institution. Elected representatives may choose to not honour their promises, safe in the knowledge that their position is secure until the next election. A disconnect from political processes can also lead to apathy among citizens, reducing their incentive to vote or otherwise participate in elections and other decision-making processes. Lastly, the election of representatives can deeply polarize citizens, especially in instances in which the election result was a narrow call, or disputed, leading to doubts over a representative\u2019s victory. In such cases, a significant portion of the population may feel unrepresented or neglected by the elected representative, resulting in citizens\u2019 apathy or in attempts by them to have their voices heard, such as protests or strikes.\n\nquestion: How is power placed in the United States system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The United States is a presidential republic system, in which the president is popularly elected and can appoint a cabinet but exists separately from elected federal legislative bodies (the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives).", "usage": 775}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Nearly all modern Western-style democracies function as some type of representative democracy: for example, the United Kingdom (a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy), Germany (a federal parliamentary republic), France (a unitary semi-presidential republic), and the United States (a federal presidential republic). Representative democracy places power in the hands of representatives who are elected by the people. Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives). Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy. Representative democracy can be organized in different ways, including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber or two chambers. Where two chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways. The power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power: Theorists such as Edmund Burke believe that part of the duty of a representative was not simply to communicate the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters: Certainly, Gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a Representative, to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the Law and the Constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. The Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly. A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems. In Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments. The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns. Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries. The American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and Black people, and others not originally given voting rights, in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Until it was repealed by the Fourteenth Amendment following the Civil War, the Three-Fifths Compromise gave a disproportionate representation of slave states in the House of Representatives relative to the voters in free states. In 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all males in 1792. Universal male suffrage was re-established in France in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848. Representative democracy came into general favour particularly in post-industrial revolution nation states\n\nquestion: How is power placed in the United States system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Representative democracy places power in the hands of representatives who are elected by the people.", "usage": 1138}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Many historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern representative democracy in the United Kingdom. Globally, a majority of governments in the world are representative democracies, including constitutional monarchies and republics with strong representative branches. Separate but related, and very large, bodies of research in political philosophy and social science investigate how and how well elected representatives, such as legislators, represent the interests or preferences of one or another constituency. The empirical research shows that representative systems tend to be biased towards the representation of more affluent classes, to the detriment of the population at large. In his book Political Parties, written in 1911, Robert Michels argues that most representative systems deteriorate towards an oligarchy or particracy. This is known as the iron law of oligarchy. Representative democracies which are stable have been analysed by Adolf Gasser and compared to the unstable representative democracies in his book Gemeindefreiheit als Rettung Europas which was published in 1943 and a second edition in 1947. Adolf Gasser stated the following requirements for a representative democracy in order to remain stable, unaffected by the iron law of oligarchy: A drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance. Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized. Proponents of direct democracy criticize representative democracy due to its inherent structure. As the fundamental basis of representative democracy is non inclusive system, in which representatives turn into an elite class that works behind closed doors, as well as the criticizing the elector system as being driven by a capitalistic and authoritarian system. The system of stochocracy has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected. Stochocracy aims to at least reduce this degradation by having all representatives appointed by lottery instead of by voting. Therefore, this system is also called lottocracy. The system was proposed by the writer Roger de Sizif in 1998 in his book La Stochocratie. Choosing officeholders by lot was also the standard practice in ancient Athenian democracy and in ancient India. The rationale behind this practice was to avoid lobbying and electioneering by economic oligarchs. The system of deliberative democracy is a mix between a majority-ruled system and a consensus-based system. It allows for representative democracies or direct democracies to coexist with its system of governance, providing an initial advantage.\n\nquestion: How is power placed in the United States system of government?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 647}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

What we eat, where we go to school, what kind of education we receive, how our tax money is spent, and what we do in our free time are all affected by government. Americans are often unaware of the pervasiveness of government in their everyday lives, and many are unsure precisely what it does. Here we will look at what government is, what it does, and how the government of the United States differs from other kinds of governments. The term government describes the means by which a society organizes itself and how it allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs. Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity, secure national borders, and the safety and well-being of citizens. Governments also provide benefits for their citizens. The type of benefits provided differ according to the country and their specific type of governmental system, but governments commonly provide such things as education, health care, and an infrastructure for transportation. The term politics refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals, especially those related to the division of resources within a nation. Sometimes governmental systems are confused with economic systems. This is because certain types of political thought or governmental organization are closely related to or develop with certain types of economic systems. For example, the economic system of capitalism in Western Europe and North America developed at roughly the same time as ideas about democratic republics, self-government, and natural rights. At this time, the idea of liberty became an important concept. According to John Locke, an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century, all people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed. In the eighteenth century, in Great Britain\u2019s North American colonies, and later in France, this developed into the idea that people should govern themselves through elected representatives and not a king; only those representatives chosen by the people had the right to make laws to govern them. Similarly, Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher who was born nineteen years after Locke\u2019s death, believed that all people should be free to acquire property in any way that they wished. Instead of being controlled by government, business, and industry, Smith argued, people should be allowed to operate as they wish and keep the proceeds of their work. Competition would ensure that prices remained low and faulty goods disappeared from the market. In this way, businesses would reap profits, consumers would have their needs satisfied, and society as a whole would prosper. Smith discussed these ideas, which formed the basis for industrial capitalism, in his book The Wealth of Nations, which was published in 1776, the same year that the Declaration of Independence was written. Representative government and capitalism developed together in the United States, and many Americans tend to equate democracy, a political system in which people govern themselves, with capitalism. In theory, a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled, for good or bad, by government. Capitalism, in turn, relies on individualism. At the same time, successful capitalists prefer political systems over which they can exert at least some influence in order to maintain their liberty. Democracy and capitalism do not have to go hand in hand, however. Indeed, one might argue that a capitalist economic system might be bad for democracy in some respects. Although Smith theorized that capitalism would lead to prosperity for all, this has not necessarily been the case. Great gaps in wealth between the owners of major businesses, industries, and financial institutions and those who work for others in exchange for wages exist in many capitalist nations. In turn, great wealth may give a very small minority great influence over the government\u2014a greater influence than that held by the majority of the population, which will be discussed later. Socialism is an alternative economic system. In socialist societies, the means of generating wealth, such as factories, large farms, and banks, are owned by the government and not by private individuals. The government accumulates wealth and then redistributes it to citizens, primarily in the form of social programs that provide such things as free or inexpensive health care, education, and childcare. In socialist countries, the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity, transportation systems like airlines and railroads, and telecommunications systems. In many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy: only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government. For example, in China, the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party. In the United States, the democratic government works closely together with its capitalist economic system. The interconnectedness of the two affects the way in which goods and services are distributed. The market provides many goods and services needed by Americans. For example, food, clothing, and housing are provided in ample supply by private businesses that earn a profit in return.

This, of course, is the ideal. In reality, those who live in poverty cannot always afford to buy ample food and clothing to meet their needs, or the food and clothing that they can afford to buy in abundance is of inferior quality. Also, it is often difficult to find adequate housing; housing in the most desirable neighborhoods\u2014those that have low crime rates and good schools\u2014is often too expensive for poor or working-class (and sometimes middle-class) people to buy or rent. Thus, the market cannot provide everything (in enough quantity or at low enough costs) in order to meet everyone\u2019s needs. Therefore, some goods are provided by the government. Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called public goods. Two such public goods are national security and education. It is difficult to see how a private business could protect the United States from attack. How could it build its own armies and create plans for defense and attack? Who would pay the men and women who served? Where would the intelligence come from? Due to its ability to tax, draw upon the resources of an entire nation, and compel citizen compliance, only government is capable of protecting the nation. Similarly, public schools provide education for all children in the United States. Children of all religions, races and ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, and levels of academic ability can attend public schools free of charge from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. It would be impossible for private schools to provide an education for all of the nation\u2019s children. Private schools do provide some education in the United States; however, they charge tuition, and only those parents who can afford to pay their fees (or whose children gain a scholarship) can attend these institutions. Some schools charge very high tuition, the equivalent to the tuition at a private college. If private schools were the only educational institutions, most poor and working-class children and many middle-class children would be uneducated. Private schooling is a type of good called a toll good. Toll goods are available to many people, and many people can make use of them, but only if they can pay the price. They occupy a middle ground between public and private goods. All parents may send their children to public schools in the United States. They can choose to send their children to a private school, but the private school will charge them. On the other hand, public schools, which are operated by the government, provide free education so all children can attend school. Therefore, everyone in the nation benefits from the educated voters and workers produced by the public school system. Another distinction between public and private goods is that public goods are available to all, typically without additional charge. What other public goods does government provide in the United States? At the federal, state, and local level, government provides stability and security, not only in the form of a military but also in the form of police and fire departments. Government provides other valuable goods and services such as public education, public transportation, mail service, and food, housing, and health care for the poor (Figure 1.2). If a house catches on fire, the fire department does not demand payment before they put the fire out. If someone breaks into a house and tries to harm the occupants, the police will try to protect them and arrest the intruder, but the police department will not request payment for services rendered. The provision of these goods and services is funded by citizens paying into the general tax base. Government also performs the important job of protecting common goods: goods that all people may use free of charge but that are of limited supply, such as fish in the sea or clean drinking water. Because everyone can use these goods, they must be protected so a few people do not take everything that is available and leave others with nothing. Some examples of common goods, private goods, public goods, and toll goods are listed below (Figure 1.3). This federal website shares information about the many services the government provides. One of the many important things government does is regulate public access to common goods like natural resources. Unlike public goods, which all people may use without charge, common goods are in limited supply. If more public schools are needed, the government can build more. If more firefighters or mail carriers are needed, the government can hire them. Public lands and wildlife, however, are not goods the government can simply multiply if supply falls due to demand. Indeed, if some people take too freely from the supply of common goods, there will not be enough left for others to use. Fish are one of the many common goods in which the government currently regulates access. It does so to ensure that certain species are not fished into extinction, thus depriving future generations of an important food source and a means to make a living. This idea is known as sustainability. Environmentalists want to set strict fishing limits on a variety of species. Commercial fishers resist these limits, claiming they are\n\nquestion: What curtails the power of representatives in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1106}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Currently, fishing limits are set by a combination of scientists, politicians, local resource managers, and groups representing the interests of fishers.3 Should the government regulate fishing? Is it right to interfere with people\u2019s ability to earn money today in order to protect the access of future generations to the nation\u2019s common goods? Besides providing stability and goods and services for all, government also creates a structure by which goods and services can be made available to the people. In the United States, people elect representatives to city councils, state legislatures, and Congress. These bodies make laws to govern their respective jurisdictions. They also pass measures to raise money, through the imposition of taxes on such things as income, property, and sales. Local, state, and national governments also draft budgets to determine how the revenue taken in will be spent for services. On the local level, funds are allotted for education, police and fire departments, and maintenance of public parks. State governments allocate money for state colleges and universities, maintenance of state roads and bridges, and wildlife management, among other priorities. On the national level, money goes to such things as defense, Social Security, pensions for veterans, maintenance of federal courts and prisons, and management of national parks. At each level, representatives elected by the people try to secure funding for things that will benefit those who live in the areas they represent. Once money has been allocated, government agencies at each level then receive funds for the purposes mentioned above and use them to provide services to the public. Local, state, and national governments also make laws to maintain order and to ensure the efficient functioning of society, including the fair operation of the business marketplace. In the United States, for example, Congress passes laws regulating banking, and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories, the purity of food offered for sale, and the safety of toys and automobiles. In this way, government checks the actions of business, something that it would not do if capitalism in the United States functioned strictly in the manner that Adam Smith believed it should\u2026almost entirely unregulated. Besides providing goods to citizens and maintaining public safety, most governments also provide a means for citizens to participate in government and to make their opinions known to those in power. Western democracies like the United States, Britain, France, and others protect citizens\u2019 freedom of speech and the press. These nations, and others in the world, also allow citizens to vote. As noted earlier, politics is the process by which choices are made regarding how resources will be allocated and which economic and social policies government will pursue. Put more simply, politics is the process of who gets what and how. Politics involves choosing which values government will support and which it will not. If government chooses to support an ideal such as individualism, it may choose to loosen regulations on business and industry or to cut taxes so that people have more money to invest in business. If it chooses to support an ideal such as egalitarianism, which calls for equal treatment for all and the destruction of socioeconomic inequalities, it may raise taxes in order to be able to spend more on public education, public transportation, housing for the poor, and care for the elderly. If, for example, the government is more concerned with national security than with individual liberty, it may authorize the tapping of people\u2019s phones and restrict what newspapers may publish. If liberty is more important, then government will place greater restrictions on the extent that law enforcement agencies can intrude upon citizens\u2019 private communications. The political process and the input of citizens help determine the answer. Civic engagement, or the participation that connects citizens to government, is a vital ingredient of politics. In the United States, citizens play an important role in influencing what policies are pursued, what values the government chooses to support, what initiatives are granted funding, and who gets to make the final decisions. Political engagement can take many forms: reading about politics, listening to news reports, discussing politics, attending (or watching televised) political debates, donating money to political campaigns, handing out flyers promoting a candidate, voting, joining protest marches, and writing letters to their elected representatives. The government of the United States can best be described as a republic, or representative democracy. A democracy is a government in which political power\u2014influence over institutions, leaders, and policies\u2014rests in the hands of the people. In a representative democracy, however, the citizens do not govern directly. Instead, they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf. Most representative governments favor majority rule: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority. If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it\n\nquestion: What curtails the power of representatives in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": " Majority rule", "usage": 1109}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

However, in representative governments like the United States, minority rights are protected: people cannot be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be. For example, let\u2019s say American society decided that atheists, people who do not believe that God exists, were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country. Even though atheists only account for about 7 percent of the population, they would be protected due to minority rights.4 Even though the number of Americans who believe in God far outweighs the number who do not, the minority is still protected. Because decisions are made through majority rule, making your opinions known and voting for those men and women who make decisions that affect all of us are critical and influential forms of civic engagement in a representative democracy such as the United States. In a direct democracy, unlike representative democracy, people participate directly in making government decisions. For example, in ancient Athens, the most famous example of a direct democracy, all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly. Here they debated and voted for or against all proposed laws. Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy\u2014the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government\u2014some elements of direct democracy do exist in the United States. While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress, people may still directly vote on certain issues. For example, a referendum or proposed law might be placed on the ballot for citizens to vote on directly during state or local elections instead of leaving the matter in the hands of the state legislature. At New England town meetings, all residents are allowed to debate decisions affecting the town (Figure 1.5). Such occasions provide additional opportunities for civic engagement. Most countries now have some form of representative government.5 At the other end of the political spectrum are elite-driven forms of government. In a monarchy, one ruler, usually a hereditary ruler, holds political power. Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law, and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country, this is not always the case. Many southwest Asian kingdoms, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted. As discussed earlier, another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy, in which a handful of elite members of society, often those who belong to a particular political party, hold all political power. For example, in Cuba, as in China, only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office, and the party\u2019s most important members make all government decisions. Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature. Under totalitarianism, the government is more important than the citizens, and it controls all aspects of citizens\u2019 lives. Citizens\u2019 rights are limited, and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition. These forms of government are fairly rare. North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government. The CIA website provides information about the types of government across the world. As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.

The elected representatives are in turn accountable to the electorate for their actions. As a form of democracy, representative democracy exists in contrast to direct democracy, in which all citizens directly vote on laws to be passed and other issues. Most modern countries are representative democracies, and, as such, they face many challenges. Ancient Rome practiced the earliest known form of representative democracy in the Western world. The Romans called their state a republic (from the Latin respublica, meaning, literally, \u201ca thing that belongs to the people\u201d). During the era of the Roman Republic, which began in 509 bce, meetings were held in a public space, known as the forum, at the centre of each city within Roman territory. Citizenship was typically conferred by birth to all men if both parents were Roman citizens, though one of them, usually the mother, could be an alien with the right to contract a Roman marriage. Citizenship was also granted by naturalization and by manumission of enslaved people. As the republic evolved, Roman government came to have four assemblies along with the Senate, which had existed in various forms for centuries. The four assemblies, or comitia, were the Comitia Curiata, drawn from men claiming affiliation with one of several tribal groups (believed to be three groups originally created by Romulus); the Comitia Centuriata, made up of military units; the Concilium Plebis, consisting of plebeians; and the Comitia Tributa, open to any citizen. Votes within these assemblies were counted by groups, variously defined, rather than by the individuals who made up these groups. Senators were chosen indirectly by the Comitia Centuriata and exercised significant power\u2014far more than the assemblies, which ostensibly represented all Roman citizens. By the 3rd century bce, all Roman citizens had been enfranchised, but the value of the voting right was related to wealth. Women lacked any voice in public life and had no voting rights, being at all times subject to the authority of a man, typically their father or husband. As Rome expanded across Italy, new subjects were allowed to govern their own affairs while enjoying most rights of Roman citizenship except the right to vote. Latin allies who moved to Rome permanently gained full citizenship. Allies bound to Rome by treaty did not enjoy full rights but were required to pay taxes or tribute as well as provide military service; these allies revolted against their inferior social status, leading to the Social War (90\u201389 bce), at the end of which full citizenship was given to all men of Italy, sans those who were enslaved, south of the Po River. The purpose of, and power wielded by, the comitia changed after the republic collapsed and was replaced by the Roman Empire in 27 bce. This Roman form of democracy became the basis for most modern representative democracies. The Italian city-states that rose up in the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire in western Europe, such as Venice and Florence, held elections for their leaders and called themselves republics, but they limited citizen participation to only a fraction of their male population. In medieval England, Simon de Montfort played a role in two parliaments that are considered important to the development of representative democracy. The first, in 1258, consisted of a group of barons who removed from King Henry III his unlimited powers through what was, in effect, England\u2019s first written constitution. The second, in 1265, included citizens from English towns. During the 17th century, Parliament opposed the power of the British monarch during the civil wars of 1642\u221251, and its passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689 made possible the Glorious Revolution, which rendered Parliament, and not the monarch, Great Britain\u2019s ruling power. The right to vote in Britain was expanded through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries, further reinforcing Parliament\u2019s power and underscoring the place of representative democracy in Britain. The United States and France are republics that have played an important role in the adoption and spread of representative democracy. Following the American Revolution, the United States adopted a new constitution in 1787 that adopted principles of representative democracy, with members of the House of Representatives directly elected by citizens with the right to vote. (Members of the Senate were elected indirectly until 1913.) Voting rights expanded over time to include women, men who did not own property, and Black people, among other groups. France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789, and the deputies that made up the short-lived National Convention were elected through universal male suffrage in 1792. Those voting rights subsequently eroded, however, until the revolution of 1848 resulted in their reinstatement; nearly a century later, suffrage was granted to women\n\nquestion: What curtails the power of representatives in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Senate had control over the number of representatives each state could have.", "usage": 1128}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Modern representative democracies have come into being through a variety of political institutions, most of which made their first appearance in Europe and the United States in the 18th century. The concept of representation is itself the most important, because it enables government officials who are elected by citizens to make major decisions and establish policies. Important institutions include: More than half of the world\u2019s countries are some form of representative democracy. Some are parliamentary constitutional monarchies, in which the head of state is a hereditary monarch and most or all political decisions and initiatives are the responsibility of an elected parliament. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands fall in this category. Countries such as Germany and India are federal parliamentary republics, which typically have a bicameral parliament. In a bicameral parliament, one of the houses (typically called the lower house) is directly elected by the country\u2019s citizens. The other house (the upper house) is elected by representatives of individual states or regions of the country. Since the regional representatives are in turn elected by citizens of those regions, the upper house is indirectly elected by the people. Federal parliamentary republics allow for each state or region to have a say in decisions made at the national, or federal, level. The United Kingdom also has a bicameral legislature, but the upper house, the House of Lords, is not an elected body, its members taking their positions by appointment or on account of a hereditary seat. France follows a semi-presidential republic model in which the president is a popularly (and directly) elected head of state, but the president\u2019s cabinet is responsible to an elected legislature, the National Assembly, which in turn supports the appointment of a prime minister. In contrast, the United States is a presidential republic system, in which the president is popularly elected and can appoint a cabinet but exists separately from elected federal legislative bodies (the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives). A representative democracy allows voters the opportunity to elect their preferred representative, who is then expected to follow the will of the electorate in making decisions. Thus citizens remove themselves from the strain of day-to-day decision making, while retaining the right to voice their opinions and to campaign or lobby for their points of view. Representatives can shape laws and policies in a way that gives the greatest benefit to the most people. However, once elected, representatives are not legally obligated to reflect the will of the people. The lure of political influence, monetary gain, and other factors can result in accusations of corruption or undue influence and damage the integrity of an elected institution. Elected representatives may choose to not honour their promises, safe in the knowledge that their position is secure until the next election. A disconnect from political processes can also lead to apathy among citizens, reducing their incentive to vote or otherwise participate in elections and other decision-making processes. Lastly, the election of representatives can deeply polarize citizens, especially in instances in which the election result was a narrow call, or disputed, leading to doubts over a representative\u2019s victory. In such cases, a significant portion of the population may feel unrepresented or neglected by the elected representative, resulting in citizens\u2019 apathy or in attempts by them to have their voices heard, such as protests or strikes.\n\nquestion: What curtails the power of representatives in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The lure of political influence, monetary gain, and other factors can result in accusations of corruption or undue influence and damage the integrity of an elected institution.

Nearly all modern Western-style democracies function as some type of representative democracy: for example, the United Kingdom (a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy), Germany (a federal parliamentary republic), France (a unitary semi-presidential republic), and the United States (a federal presidential republic). Representative democracy places power in the hands of representatives who are elected by the people. Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives). Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy. Representative democracy can be organized in different ways, including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber or two chambers. Where two chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways. The power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power: Theorists such as Edmund Burke believe that part of the duty of a representative was not simply to communicate the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters: Certainly, Gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a Representative, to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the Law and the Constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. The Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly. A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems. In Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments. The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns. Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries. The American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and Black people, and others not originally given voting rights, in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Until it was repealed by the Fourteenth Amendment following the Civil War, the Three-Fifths Compromise gave a disproportionate representation of slave states in the House of Representatives relative to the voters in free states. In 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all males in 1792. Universal male suffrage was re-established in France in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848. Representative democracy came into general favour particularly in post-industrial revolution nation states\n\nquestion: What curtails the power of representatives in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "a constitution", "usage": 1123}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Many historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern representative democracy in the United Kingdom. Globally, a majority of governments in the world are representative democracies, including constitutional monarchies and republics with strong representative branches. Separate but related, and very large, bodies of research in political philosophy and social science investigate how and how well elected representatives, such as legislators, represent the interests or preferences of one or another constituency. The empirical research shows that representative systems tend to be biased towards the representation of more affluent classes, to the detriment of the population at large. In his book Political Parties, written in 1911, Robert Michels argues that most representative systems deteriorate towards an oligarchy or particracy. This is known as the iron law of oligarchy. Representative democracies which are stable have been analysed by Adolf Gasser and compared to the unstable representative democracies in his book Gemeindefreiheit als Rettung Europas which was published in 1943 and a second edition in 1947. Adolf Gasser stated the following requirements for a representative democracy in order to remain stable, unaffected by the iron law of oligarchy: A drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance. Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized. Proponents of direct democracy criticize representative democracy due to its inherent structure. As the fundamental basis of representative democracy is non inclusive system, in which representatives turn into an elite class that works behind closed doors, as well as the criticizing the elector system as being driven by a capitalistic and authoritarian system. The system of stochocracy has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected. Stochocracy aims to at least reduce this degradation by having all representatives appointed by lottery instead of by voting. Therefore, this system is also called lottocracy. The system was proposed by the writer Roger de Sizif in 1998 in his book La Stochocratie. Choosing officeholders by lot was also the standard practice in ancient Athenian democracy and in ancient India. The rationale behind this practice was to avoid lobbying and electioneering by economic oligarchs. The system of deliberative democracy is a mix between a majority-ruled system and a consensus-based system. It allows for representative democracies or direct democracies to coexist with its system of governance, providing an initial advantage.\n\nquestion: What curtails the power of representatives in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The empirical research shows that representative systems tend to be biased towards the representation of more affluent classes, to the detriment of the population at large.", "usage": 673}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

What we eat, where we go to school, what kind of education we receive, how our tax money is spent, and what we do in our free time are all affected by government. Americans are often unaware of the pervasiveness of government in their everyday lives, and many are unsure precisely what it does. Here we will look at what government is, what it does, and how the government of the United States differs from other kinds of governments. The term government describes the means by which a society organizes itself and how it allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs. Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity, secure national borders, and the safety and well-being of citizens. Governments also provide benefits for their citizens. The type of benefits provided differ according to the country and their specific type of governmental system, but governments commonly provide such things as education, health care, and an infrastructure for transportation. The term politics refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals, especially those related to the division of resources within a nation. Sometimes governmental systems are confused with economic systems. This is because certain types of political thought or governmental organization are closely related to or develop with certain types of economic systems. For example, the economic system of capitalism in Western Europe and North America developed at roughly the same time as ideas about democratic republics, self-government, and natural rights. At this time, the idea of liberty became an important concept. According to John Locke, an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century, all people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed. In the eighteenth century, in Great Britain\u2019s North American colonies, and later in France, this developed into the idea that people should govern themselves through elected representatives and not a king; only those representatives chosen by the people had the right to make laws to govern them. Similarly, Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher who was born nineteen years after Locke\u2019s death, believed that all people should be free to acquire property in any way that they wished. Instead of being controlled by government, business, and industry, Smith argued, people should be allowed to operate as they wish and keep the proceeds of their work. Competition would ensure that prices remained low and faulty goods disappeared from the market. In this way, businesses would reap profits, consumers would have their needs satisfied, and society as a whole would prosper. Smith discussed these ideas, which formed the basis for industrial capitalism, in his book The Wealth of Nations, which was published in 1776, the same year that the Declaration of Independence was written. Representative government and capitalism developed together in the United States, and many Americans tend to equate democracy, a political system in which people govern themselves, with capitalism. In theory, a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled, for good or bad, by government. Capitalism, in turn, relies on individualism. At the same time, successful capitalists prefer political systems over which they can exert at least some influence in order to maintain their liberty. Democracy and capitalism do not have to go hand in hand, however. Indeed, one might argue that a capitalist economic system might be bad for democracy in some respects. Although Smith theorized that capitalism would lead to prosperity for all, this has not necessarily been the case. Great gaps in wealth between the owners of major businesses, industries, and financial institutions and those who work for others in exchange for wages exist in many capitalist nations. In turn, great wealth may give a very small minority great influence over the government\u2014a greater influence than that held by the majority of the population, which will be discussed later. Socialism is an alternative economic system. In socialist societies, the means of generating wealth, such as factories, large farms, and banks, are owned by the government and not by private individuals. The government accumulates wealth and then redistributes it to citizens, primarily in the form of social programs that provide such things as free or inexpensive health care, education, and childcare. In socialist countries, the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity, transportation systems like airlines and railroads, and telecommunications systems. In many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy: only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government. For example, in China, the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party. In the United States, the democratic government works closely together with its capitalist economic system. The interconnectedness of the two affects the way in which goods and services are distributed. The market provides many goods and services needed by Americans. For example, food, clothing, and housing are provided in ample supply by private businesses that earn a profit in return. These\n\nquestion: What power does the judiciary have in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1105}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This, of course, is the ideal. In reality, those who live in poverty cannot always afford to buy ample food and clothing to meet their needs, or the food and clothing that they can afford to buy in abundance is of inferior quality. Also, it is often difficult to find adequate housing; housing in the most desirable neighborhoods\u2014those that have low crime rates and good schools\u2014is often too expensive for poor or working-class (and sometimes middle-class) people to buy or rent. Thus, the market cannot provide everything (in enough quantity or at low enough costs) in order to meet everyone\u2019s needs. Therefore, some goods are provided by the government. Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called public goods. Two such public goods are national security and education. It is difficult to see how a private business could protect the United States from attack. How could it build its own armies and create plans for defense and attack? Who would pay the men and women who served? Where would the intelligence come from? Due to its ability to tax, draw upon the resources of an entire nation, and compel citizen compliance, only government is capable of protecting the nation. Similarly, public schools provide education for all children in the United States. Children of all religions, races and ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, and levels of academic ability can attend public schools free of charge from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. It would be impossible for private schools to provide an education for all of the nation\u2019s children. Private schools do provide some education in the United States; however, they charge tuition, and only those parents who can afford to pay their fees (or whose children gain a scholarship) can attend these institutions. Some schools charge very high tuition, the equivalent to the tuition at a private college. If private schools were the only educational institutions, most poor and working-class children and many middle-class children would be uneducated. Private schooling is a type of good called a toll good. Toll goods are available to many people, and many people can make use of them, but only if they can pay the price. They occupy a middle ground between public and private goods. All parents may send their children to public schools in the United States. They can choose to send their children to a private school, but the private school will charge them. On the other hand, public schools, which are operated by the government, provide free education so all children can attend school. Therefore, everyone in the nation benefits from the educated voters and workers produced by the public school system. Another distinction between public and private goods is that public goods are available to all, typically without additional charge. What other public goods does government provide in the United States? At the federal, state, and local level, government provides stability and security, not only in the form of a military but also in the form of police and fire departments. Government provides other valuable goods and services such as public education, public transportation, mail service, and food, housing, and health care for the poor (Figure 1.2). If a house catches on fire, the fire department does not demand payment before they put the fire out. If someone breaks into a house and tries to harm the occupants, the police will try to protect them and arrest the intruder, but the police department will not request payment for services rendered. The provision of these goods and services is funded by citizens paying into the general tax base. Government also performs the important job of protecting common goods: goods that all people may use free of charge but that are of limited supply, such as fish in the sea or clean drinking water. Because everyone can use these goods, they must be protected so a few people do not take everything that is available and leave others with nothing. Some examples of common goods, private goods, public goods, and toll goods are listed below (Figure 1.3). This federal website shares information about the many services the government provides. One of the many important things government does is regulate public access to common goods like natural resources. Unlike public goods, which all people may use without charge, common goods are in limited supply. If more public schools are needed, the government can build more. If more firefighters or mail carriers are needed, the government can hire them. Public lands and wildlife, however, are not goods the government can simply multiply if supply falls due to demand. Indeed, if some people take too freely from the supply of common goods, there will not be enough left for others to use. Fish are one of the many common goods in which the government currently regulates access. It does so to ensure that certain species are not fished into extinction, thus depriving future generations of an important food source and a means to make a living. This idea is known as sustainability. Environmentalists want to set strict fishing limits on a variety of species. Commercial fishers resist these limits, claiming they are\n\nquestion: What power does the judiciary have in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1105}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Currently, fishing limits are set by a combination of scientists, politicians, local resource managers, and groups representing the interests of fishers.3 Should the government regulate fishing? Is it right to interfere with people\u2019s ability to earn money today in order to protect the access of future generations to the nation\u2019s common goods? Besides providing stability and goods and services for all, government also creates a structure by which goods and services can be made available to the people. In the United States, people elect representatives to city councils, state legislatures, and Congress. These bodies make laws to govern their respective jurisdictions. They also pass measures to raise money, through the imposition of taxes on such things as income, property, and sales. Local, state, and national governments also draft budgets to determine how the revenue taken in will be spent for services. On the local level, funds are allotted for education, police and fire departments, and maintenance of public parks. State governments allocate money for state colleges and universities, maintenance of state roads and bridges, and wildlife management, among other priorities. On the national level, money goes to such things as defense, Social Security, pensions for veterans, maintenance of federal courts and prisons, and management of national parks. At each level, representatives elected by the people try to secure funding for things that will benefit those who live in the areas they represent. Once money has been allocated, government agencies at each level then receive funds for the purposes mentioned above and use them to provide services to the public. Local, state, and national governments also make laws to maintain order and to ensure the efficient functioning of society, including the fair operation of the business marketplace. In the United States, for example, Congress passes laws regulating banking, and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories, the purity of food offered for sale, and the safety of toys and automobiles. In this way, government checks the actions of business, something that it would not do if capitalism in the United States functioned strictly in the manner that Adam Smith believed it should\u2026almost entirely unregulated. Besides providing goods to citizens and maintaining public safety, most governments also provide a means for citizens to participate in government and to make their opinions known to those in power. Western democracies like the United States, Britain, France, and others protect citizens\u2019 freedom of speech and the press. These nations, and others in the world, also allow citizens to vote. As noted earlier, politics is the process by which choices are made regarding how resources will be allocated and which economic and social policies government will pursue. Put more simply, politics is the process of who gets what and how. Politics involves choosing which values government will support and which it will not. If government chooses to support an ideal such as individualism, it may choose to loosen regulations on business and industry or to cut taxes so that people have more money to invest in business. If it chooses to support an ideal such as egalitarianism, which calls for equal treatment for all and the destruction of socioeconomic inequalities, it may raise taxes in order to be able to spend more on public education, public transportation, housing for the poor, and care for the elderly. If, for example, the government is more concerned with national security than with individual liberty, it may authorize the tapping of people\u2019s phones and restrict what newspapers may publish. If liberty is more important, then government will place greater restrictions on the extent that law enforcement agencies can intrude upon citizens\u2019 private communications. The political process and the input of citizens help determine the answer. Civic engagement, or the participation that connects citizens to government, is a vital ingredient of politics. In the United States, citizens play an important role in influencing what policies are pursued, what values the government chooses to support, what initiatives are granted funding, and who gets to make the final decisions. Political engagement can take many forms: reading about politics, listening to news reports, discussing politics, attending (or watching televised) political debates, donating money to political campaigns, handing out flyers promoting a candidate, voting, joining protest marches, and writing letters to their elected representatives. The government of the United States can best be described as a republic, or representative democracy. A democracy is a government in which political power\u2014influence over institutions, leaders, and policies\u2014rests in the hands of the people. In a representative democracy, however, the citizens do not govern directly. Instead, they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf. Most representative governments favor majority rule: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority. If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it\n\nquestion: What power does the judiciary have in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "It ensures the fair operation of the business marketplace.", "usage": 1116}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

However, in representative governments like the United States, minority rights are protected: people cannot be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be. For example, let\u2019s say American society decided that atheists, people who do not believe that God exists, were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country. Even though atheists only account for about 7 percent of the population, they would be protected due to minority rights.4 Even though the number of Americans who believe in God far outweighs the number who do not, the minority is still protected. Because decisions are made through majority rule, making your opinions known and voting for those men and women who make decisions that affect all of us are critical and influential forms of civic engagement in a representative democracy such as the United States. In a direct democracy, unlike representative democracy, people participate directly in making government decisions. For example, in ancient Athens, the most famous example of a direct democracy, all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly. Here they debated and voted for or against all proposed laws. Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy\u2014the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government\u2014some elements of direct democracy do exist in the United States. While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress, people may still directly vote on certain issues. For example, a referendum or proposed law might be placed on the ballot for citizens to vote on directly during state or local elections instead of leaving the matter in the hands of the state legislature. At New England town meetings, all residents are allowed to debate decisions affecting the town (Figure 1.5). Such occasions provide additional opportunities for civic engagement. Most countries now have some form of representative government.5 At the other end of the political spectrum are elite-driven forms of government. In a monarchy, one ruler, usually a hereditary ruler, holds political power. Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law, and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country, this is not always the case. Many southwest Asian kingdoms, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted. As discussed earlier, another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy, in which a handful of elite members of society, often those who belong to a particular political party, hold all political power. For example, in Cuba, as in China, only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office, and the party\u2019s most important members make all government decisions. Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature. Under totalitarianism, the government is more important than the citizens, and it controls all aspects of citizens\u2019 lives. Citizens\u2019 rights are limited, and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition. These forms of government are fairly rare. North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government. The CIA website provides information about the types of government across the world. As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.

The elected representatives are in turn accountable to the electorate for their actions. As a form of democracy, representative democracy exists in contrast to direct democracy, in which all citizens directly vote on laws to be passed and other issues. Most modern countries are representative democracies, and, as such, they face many challenges. Ancient Rome practiced the earliest known form of representative democracy in the Western world. The Romans called their state a republic (from the Latin respublica, meaning, literally, \u201ca thing that belongs to the people\u201d). During the era of the Roman Republic, which began in 509 bce, meetings were held in a public space, known as the forum, at the centre of each city within Roman territory. Citizenship was typically conferred by birth to all men if both parents were Roman citizens, though one of them, usually the mother, could be an alien with the right to contract a Roman marriage. Citizenship was also granted by naturalization and by manumission of enslaved people. As the republic evolved, Roman government came to have four assemblies along with the Senate, which had existed in various forms for centuries. The four assemblies, or comitia, were the Comitia Curiata, drawn from men claiming affiliation with one of several tribal groups (believed to be three groups originally created by Romulus); the Comitia Centuriata, made up of military units; the Concilium Plebis, consisting of plebeians; and the Comitia Tributa, open to any citizen. Votes within these assemblies were counted by groups, variously defined, rather than by the individuals who made up these groups. Senators were chosen indirectly by the Comitia Centuriata and exercised significant power\u2014far more than the assemblies, which ostensibly represented all Roman citizens. By the 3rd century bce, all Roman citizens had been enfranchised, but the value of the voting right was related to wealth. Women lacked any voice in public life and had no voting rights, being at all times subject to the authority of a man, typically their father or husband. As Rome expanded across Italy, new subjects were allowed to govern their own affairs while enjoying most rights of Roman citizenship except the right to vote. Latin allies who moved to Rome permanently gained full citizenship. Allies bound to Rome by treaty did not enjoy full rights but were required to pay taxes or tribute as well as provide military service; these allies revolted against their inferior social status, leading to the Social War (90\u201389 bce), at the end of which full citizenship was given to all men of Italy, sans those who were enslaved, south of the Po River. The purpose of, and power wielded by, the comitia changed after the republic collapsed and was replaced by the Roman Empire in 27 bce. This Roman form of democracy became the basis for most modern representative democracies. The Italian city-states that rose up in the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire in western Europe, such as Venice and Florence, held elections for their leaders and called themselves republics, but they limited citizen participation to only a fraction of their male population. In medieval England, Simon de Montfort played a role in two parliaments that are considered important to the development of representative democracy. The first, in 1258, consisted of a group of barons who removed from King Henry III his unlimited powers through what was, in effect, England\u2019s first written constitution. The second, in 1265, included citizens from English towns. During the 17th century, Parliament opposed the power of the British monarch during the civil wars of 1642\u221251, and its passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689 made possible the Glorious Revolution, which rendered Parliament, and not the monarch, Great Britain\u2019s ruling power. The right to vote in Britain was expanded through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries, further reinforcing Parliament\u2019s power and underscoring the place of representative democracy in Britain. The United States and France are republics that have played an important role in the adoption and spread of representative democracy. Following the American Revolution, the United States adopted a new constitution in 1787 that adopted principles of representative democracy, with members of the House of Representatives directly elected by citizens with the right to vote. (Members of the Senate were elected indirectly until 1913.) Voting rights expanded over time to include women, men who did not own property, and Black people, among other groups. France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789, and the deputies that made up the short-lived National Convention were elected through universal male suffrage in 1792. Those voting rights subsequently eroded, however, until the revolution of 1848 resulted in their reinstatement; nearly a century later, suffrage was granted to women\n\nquestion: What power does the judiciary have in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1115}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Modern representative democracies have come into being through a variety of political institutions, most of which made their first appearance in Europe and the United States in the 18th century. The concept of representation is itself the most important, because it enables government officials who are elected by citizens to make major decisions and establish policies. Important institutions include: More than half of the world\u2019s countries are some form of representative democracy. Some are parliamentary constitutional monarchies, in which the head of state is a hereditary monarch and most or all political decisions and initiatives are the responsibility of an elected parliament. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands fall in this category. Countries such as Germany and India are federal parliamentary republics, which typically have a bicameral parliament. In a bicameral parliament, one of the houses (typically called the lower house) is directly elected by the country\u2019s citizens. The other house (the upper house) is elected by representatives of individual states or regions of the country. Since the regional representatives are in turn elected by citizens of those regions, the upper house is indirectly elected by the people. Federal parliamentary republics allow for each state or region to have a say in decisions made at the national, or federal, level. The United Kingdom also has a bicameral legislature, but the upper house, the House of Lords, is not an elected body, its members taking their positions by appointment or on account of a hereditary seat. France follows a semi-presidential republic model in which the president is a popularly (and directly) elected head of state, but the president\u2019s cabinet is responsible to an elected legislature, the National Assembly, which in turn supports the appointment of a prime minister. In contrast, the United States is a presidential republic system, in which the president is popularly elected and can appoint a cabinet but exists separately from elected federal legislative bodies (the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives). A representative democracy allows voters the opportunity to elect their preferred representative, who is then expected to follow the will of the electorate in making decisions. Thus citizens remove themselves from the strain of day-to-day decision making, while retaining the right to voice their opinions and to campaign or lobby for their points of view. Representatives can shape laws and policies in a way that gives the greatest benefit to the most people. However, once elected, representatives are not legally obligated to reflect the will of the people. The lure of political influence, monetary gain, and other factors can result in accusations of corruption or undue influence and damage the integrity of an elected institution. Elected representatives may choose to not honour their promises, safe in the knowledge that their position is secure until the next election. A disconnect from political processes can also lead to apathy among citizens, reducing their incentive to vote or otherwise participate in elections and other decision-making processes. Lastly, the election of representatives can deeply polarize citizens, especially in instances in which the election result was a narrow call, or disputed, leading to doubts over a representative\u2019s victory. In such cases, a significant portion of the population may feel unrepresented or neglected by the elected representative, resulting in citizens\u2019 apathy or in attempts by them to have their voices heard, such as protests or strikes.\n\nquestion: What power does the judiciary have in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The power to interpret and apply the law.", "usage": 742}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Nearly all modern Western-style democracies function as some type of representative democracy: for example, the United Kingdom (a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy), Germany (a federal parliamentary republic), France (a unitary semi-presidential republic), and the United States (a federal presidential republic). Representative democracy places power in the hands of representatives who are elected by the people. Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives). Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy. Representative democracy can be organized in different ways, including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber or two chambers. Where two chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways. The power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power: Theorists such as Edmund Burke believe that part of the duty of a representative was not simply to communicate the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters: Certainly, Gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a Representative, to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the Law and the Constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. The Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly. A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems. In Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments. The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns. Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries. The American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and Black people, and others not originally given voting rights, in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Until it was repealed by the Fourteenth Amendment following the Civil War, the Three-Fifths Compromise gave a disproportionate representation of slave states in the House of Representatives relative to the voters in free states. In 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all males in 1792. Universal male suffrage was re-established in France in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848. Representative democracy came into general favour particularly in post-industrial revolution nation states\n\nquestion: What power does the judiciary have in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1122}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Many historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern representative democracy in the United Kingdom. Globally, a majority of governments in the world are representative democracies, including constitutional monarchies and republics with strong representative branches. Separate but related, and very large, bodies of research in political philosophy and social science investigate how and how well elected representatives, such as legislators, represent the interests or preferences of one or another constituency. The empirical research shows that representative systems tend to be biased towards the representation of more affluent classes, to the detriment of the population at large. In his book Political Parties, written in 1911, Robert Michels argues that most representative systems deteriorate towards an oligarchy or particracy. This is known as the iron law of oligarchy. Representative democracies which are stable have been analysed by Adolf Gasser and compared to the unstable representative democracies in his book Gemeindefreiheit als Rettung Europas which was published in 1943 and a second edition in 1947. Adolf Gasser stated the following requirements for a representative democracy in order to remain stable, unaffected by the iron law of oligarchy: A drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance. Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized. Proponents of direct democracy criticize representative democracy due to its inherent structure. As the fundamental basis of representative democracy is non inclusive system, in which representatives turn into an elite class that works behind closed doors, as well as the criticizing the elector system as being driven by a capitalistic and authoritarian system. The system of stochocracy has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected. Stochocracy aims to at least reduce this degradation by having all representatives appointed by lottery instead of by voting. Therefore, this system is also called lottocracy. The system was proposed by the writer Roger de Sizif in 1998 in his book La Stochocratie. Choosing officeholders by lot was also the standard practice in ancient Athenian democracy and in ancient India. The rationale behind this practice was to avoid lobbying and electioneering by economic oligarchs. The system of deliberative democracy is a mix between a majority-ruled system and a consensus-based system. It allows for representative democracies or direct democracies to coexist with its system of governance, providing an initial advantage.\n\nquestion: What power does the judiciary have in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 646}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

What we eat, where we go to school, what kind of education we receive, how our tax money is spent, and what we do in our free time are all affected by government. Americans are often unaware of the pervasiveness of government in their everyday lives, and many are unsure precisely what it does. Here we will look at what government is, what it does, and how the government of the United States differs from other kinds of governments. The term government describes the means by which a society organizes itself and how it allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs. Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity, secure national borders, and the safety and well-being of citizens. Governments also provide benefits for their citizens. The type of benefits provided differ according to the country and their specific type of governmental system, but governments commonly provide such things as education, health care, and an infrastructure for transportation. The term politics refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals, especially those related to the division of resources within a nation. Sometimes governmental systems are confused with economic systems. This is because certain types of political thought or governmental organization are closely related to or develop with certain types of economic systems. For example, the economic system of capitalism in Western Europe and North America developed at roughly the same time as ideas about democratic republics, self-government, and natural rights. At this time, the idea of liberty became an important concept. According to John Locke, an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century, all people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed. In the eighteenth century, in Great Britain\u2019s North American colonies, and later in France, this developed into the idea that people should govern themselves through elected representatives and not a king; only those representatives chosen by the people had the right to make laws to govern them. Similarly, Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher who was born nineteen years after Locke\u2019s death, believed that all people should be free to acquire property in any way that they wished. Instead of being controlled by government, business, and industry, Smith argued, people should be allowed to operate as they wish and keep the proceeds of their work. Competition would ensure that prices remained low and faulty goods disappeared from the market. In this way, businesses would reap profits, consumers would have their needs satisfied, and society as a whole would prosper. Smith discussed these ideas, which formed the basis for industrial capitalism, in his book The Wealth of Nations, which was published in 1776, the same year that the Declaration of Independence was written. Representative government and capitalism developed together in the United States, and many Americans tend to equate democracy, a political system in which people govern themselves, with capitalism. In theory, a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled, for good or bad, by government. Capitalism, in turn, relies on individualism. At the same time, successful capitalists prefer political systems over which they can exert at least some influence in order to maintain their liberty. Democracy and capitalism do not have to go hand in hand, however. Indeed, one might argue that a capitalist economic system might be bad for democracy in some respects. Although Smith theorized that capitalism would lead to prosperity for all, this has not necessarily been the case. Great gaps in wealth between the owners of major businesses, industries, and financial institutions and those who work for others in exchange for wages exist in many capitalist nations. In turn, great wealth may give a very small minority great influence over the government\u2014a greater influence than that held by the majority of the population, which will be discussed later. Socialism is an alternative economic system. In socialist societies, the means of generating wealth, such as factories, large farms, and banks, are owned by the government and not by private individuals. The government accumulates wealth and then redistributes it to citizens, primarily in the form of social programs that provide such things as free or inexpensive health care, education, and childcare. In socialist countries, the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity, transportation systems like airlines and railroads, and telecommunications systems. In many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy: only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government. For example, in China, the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party. In the United States, the democratic government works closely together with its capitalist economic system. The interconnectedness of the two affects the way in which goods and services are distributed. The market provides many goods and services needed by Americans. For example, food, clothing, and housing are provided in ample supply by private businesses that earn a profit in return. These\n\nquestion: What does the constitution provide for in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1105}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This, of course, is the ideal. In reality, those who live in poverty cannot always afford to buy ample food and clothing to meet their needs, or the food and clothing that they can afford to buy in abundance is of inferior quality. Also, it is often difficult to find adequate housing; housing in the most desirable neighborhoods\u2014those that have low crime rates and good schools\u2014is often too expensive for poor or working-class (and sometimes middle-class) people to buy or rent. Thus, the market cannot provide everything (in enough quantity or at low enough costs) in order to meet everyone\u2019s needs. Therefore, some goods are provided by the government. Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called public goods. Two such public goods are national security and education. It is difficult to see how a private business could protect the United States from attack. How could it build its own armies and create plans for defense and attack? Who would pay the men and women who served? Where would the intelligence come from? Due to its ability to tax, draw upon the resources of an entire nation, and compel citizen compliance, only government is capable of protecting the nation. Similarly, public schools provide education for all children in the United States. Children of all religions, races and ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, and levels of academic ability can attend public schools free of charge from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. It would be impossible for private schools to provide an education for all of the nation\u2019s children. Private schools do provide some education in the United States; however, they charge tuition, and only those parents who can afford to pay their fees (or whose children gain a scholarship) can attend these institutions. Some schools charge very high tuition, the equivalent to the tuition at a private college. If private schools were the only educational institutions, most poor and working-class children and many middle-class children would be uneducated. Private schooling is a type of good called a toll good. Toll goods are available to many people, and many people can make use of them, but only if they can pay the price. They occupy a middle ground between public and private goods. All parents may send their children to public schools in the United States. They can choose to send their children to a private school, but the private school will charge them. On the other hand, public schools, which are operated by the government, provide free education so all children can attend school. Therefore, everyone in the nation benefits from the educated voters and workers produced by the public school system. Another distinction between public and private goods is that public goods are available to all, typically without additional charge. What other public goods does government provide in the United States? At the federal, state, and local level, government provides stability and security, not only in the form of a military but also in the form of police and fire departments. Government provides other valuable goods and services such as public education, public transportation, mail service, and food, housing, and health care for the poor (Figure 1.2). If a house catches on fire, the fire department does not demand payment before they put the fire out. If someone breaks into a house and tries to harm the occupants, the police will try to protect them and arrest the intruder, but the police department will not request payment for services rendered. The provision of these goods and services is funded by citizens paying into the general tax base. Government also performs the important job of protecting common goods: goods that all people may use free of charge but that are of limited supply, such as fish in the sea or clean drinking water. Because everyone can use these goods, they must be protected so a few people do not take everything that is available and leave others with nothing. Some examples of common goods, private goods, public goods, and toll goods are listed below (Figure 1.3). This federal website shares information about the many services the government provides. One of the many important things government does is regulate public access to common goods like natural resources. Unlike public goods, which all people may use without charge, common goods are in limited supply. If more public schools are needed, the government can build more. If more firefighters or mail carriers are needed, the government can hire them. Public lands and wildlife, however, are not goods the government can simply multiply if supply falls due to demand. Indeed, if some people take too freely from the supply of common goods, there will not be enough left for others to use. Fish are one of the many common goods in which the government currently regulates access. It does so to ensure that certain species are not fished into extinction, thus depriving future generations of an important food source and a means to make a living. This idea is known as sustainability. Environmentalists want to set strict fishing limits on a variety of species. Commercial fishers resist these limits, claiming they are\n\nquestion: What does the constitution provide for in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1105}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Currently, fishing limits are set by a combination of scientists, politicians, local resource managers, and groups representing the interests of fishers.3 Should the government regulate fishing? Is it right to interfere with people\u2019s ability to earn money today in order to protect the access of future generations to the nation\u2019s common goods? Besides providing stability and goods and services for all, government also creates a structure by which goods and services can be made available to the people. In the United States, people elect representatives to city councils, state legislatures, and Congress. These bodies make laws to govern their respective jurisdictions. They also pass measures to raise money, through the imposition of taxes on such things as income, property, and sales. Local, state, and national governments also draft budgets to determine how the revenue taken in will be spent for services. On the local level, funds are allotted for education, police and fire departments, and maintenance of public parks. State governments allocate money for state colleges and universities, maintenance of state roads and bridges, and wildlife management, among other priorities. On the national level, money goes to such things as defense, Social Security, pensions for veterans, maintenance of federal courts and prisons, and management of national parks. At each level, representatives elected by the people try to secure funding for things that will benefit those who live in the areas they represent. Once money has been allocated, government agencies at each level then receive funds for the purposes mentioned above and use them to provide services to the public. Local, state, and national governments also make laws to maintain order and to ensure the efficient functioning of society, including the fair operation of the business marketplace. In the United States, for example, Congress passes laws regulating banking, and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories, the purity of food offered for sale, and the safety of toys and automobiles. In this way, government checks the actions of business, something that it would not do if capitalism in the United States functioned strictly in the manner that Adam Smith believed it should\u2026almost entirely unregulated. Besides providing goods to citizens and maintaining public safety, most governments also provide a means for citizens to participate in government and to make their opinions known to those in power. Western democracies like the United States, Britain, France, and others protect citizens\u2019 freedom of speech and the press. These nations, and others in the world, also allow citizens to vote. As noted earlier, politics is the process by which choices are made regarding how resources will be allocated and which economic and social policies government will pursue. Put more simply, politics is the process of who gets what and how. Politics involves choosing which values government will support and which it will not. If government chooses to support an ideal such as individualism, it may choose to loosen regulations on business and industry or to cut taxes so that people have more money to invest in business. If it chooses to support an ideal such as egalitarianism, which calls for equal treatment for all and the destruction of socioeconomic inequalities, it may raise taxes in order to be able to spend more on public education, public transportation, housing for the poor, and care for the elderly. If, for example, the government is more concerned with national security than with individual liberty, it may authorize the tapping of people\u2019s phones and restrict what newspapers may publish. If liberty is more important, then government will place greater restrictions on the extent that law enforcement agencies can intrude upon citizens\u2019 private communications. The political process and the input of citizens help determine the answer. Civic engagement, or the participation that connects citizens to government, is a vital ingredient of politics. In the United States, citizens play an important role in influencing what policies are pursued, what values the government chooses to support, what initiatives are granted funding, and who gets to make the final decisions. Political engagement can take many forms: reading about politics, listening to news reports, discussing politics, attending (or watching televised) political debates, donating money to political campaigns, handing out flyers promoting a candidate, voting, joining protest marches, and writing letters to their elected representatives. The government of the United States can best be described as a republic, or representative democracy. A democracy is a government in which political power\u2014influence over institutions, leaders, and policies\u2014rests in the hands of the people. In a representative democracy, however, the citizens do not govern directly. Instead, they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf. Most representative governments favor majority rule: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority. If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it\n\nquestion: What does the constitution provide for in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1108}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

However, in representative governments like the United States, minority rights are protected: people cannot be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be. For example, let\u2019s say American society decided that atheists, people who do not believe that God exists, were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country. Even though atheists only account for about 7 percent of the population, they would be protected due to minority rights.4 Even though the number of Americans who believe in God far outweighs the number who do not, the minority is still protected. Because decisions are made through majority rule, making your opinions known and voting for those men and women who make decisions that affect all of us are critical and influential forms of civic engagement in a representative democracy such as the United States. In a direct democracy, unlike representative democracy, people participate directly in making government decisions. For example, in ancient Athens, the most famous example of a direct democracy, all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly. Here they debated and voted for or against all proposed laws. Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy\u2014the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government\u2014some elements of direct democracy do exist in the United States. While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress, people may still directly vote on certain issues. For example, a referendum or proposed law might be placed on the ballot for citizens to vote on directly during state or local elections instead of leaving the matter in the hands of the state legislature. At New England town meetings, all residents are allowed to debate decisions affecting the town (Figure 1.5). Such occasions provide additional opportunities for civic engagement. Most countries now have some form of representative government.5 At the other end of the political spectrum are elite-driven forms of government. In a monarchy, one ruler, usually a hereditary ruler, holds political power. Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law, and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country, this is not always the case. Many southwest Asian kingdoms, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted. As discussed earlier, another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy, in which a handful of elite members of society, often those who belong to a particular political party, hold all political power. For example, in Cuba, as in China, only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office, and the party\u2019s most important members make all government decisions. Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature. Under totalitarianism, the government is more important than the citizens, and it controls all aspects of citizens\u2019 lives. Citizens\u2019 rights are limited, and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition. These forms of government are fairly rare. North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government. The CIA website provides information about the types of government across the world. As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.

The elected representatives are in turn accountable to the electorate for their actions. As a form of democracy, representative democracy exists in contrast to direct democracy, in which all citizens directly vote on laws to be passed and other issues. Most modern countries are representative democracies, and, as such, they face many challenges. Ancient Rome practiced the earliest known form of representative democracy in the Western world. The Romans called their state a republic (from the Latin respublica, meaning, literally, \u201ca thing that belongs to the people\u201d). During the era of the Roman Republic, which began in 509 bce, meetings were held in a public space, known as the forum, at the centre of each city within Roman territory. Citizenship was typically conferred by birth to all men if both parents were Roman citizens, though one of them, usually the mother, could be an alien with the right to contract a Roman marriage. Citizenship was also granted by naturalization and by manumission of enslaved people. As the republic evolved, Roman government came to have four assemblies along with the Senate, which had existed in various forms for centuries. The four assemblies, or comitia, were the Comitia Curiata, drawn from men claiming affiliation with one of several tribal groups (believed to be three groups originally created by Romulus); the Comitia Centuriata, made up of military units; the Concilium Plebis, consisting of plebeians; and the Comitia Tributa, open to any citizen. Votes within these assemblies were counted by groups, variously defined, rather than by the individuals who made up these groups. Senators were chosen indirectly by the Comitia Centuriata and exercised significant power\u2014far more than the assemblies, which ostensibly represented all Roman citizens. By the 3rd century bce, all Roman citizens had been enfranchised, but the value of the voting right was related to wealth. Women lacked any voice in public life and had no voting rights, being at all times subject to the authority of a man, typically their father or husband. As Rome expanded across Italy, new subjects were allowed to govern their own affairs while enjoying most rights of Roman citizenship except the right to vote. Latin allies who moved to Rome permanently gained full citizenship. Allies bound to Rome by treaty did not enjoy full rights but were required to pay taxes or tribute as well as provide military service; these allies revolted against their inferior social status, leading to the Social War (90\u201389 bce), at the end of which full citizenship was given to all men of Italy, sans those who were enslaved, south of the Po River. The purpose of, and power wielded by, the comitia changed after the republic collapsed and was replaced by the Roman Empire in 27 bce. This Roman form of democracy became the basis for most modern representative democracies. The Italian city-states that rose up in the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire in western Europe, such as Venice and Florence, held elections for their leaders and called themselves republics, but they limited citizen participation to only a fraction of their male population. In medieval England, Simon de Montfort played a role in two parliaments that are considered important to the development of representative democracy. The first, in 1258, consisted of a group of barons who removed from King Henry III his unlimited powers through what was, in effect, England\u2019s first written constitution. The second, in 1265, included citizens from English towns. During the 17th century, Parliament opposed the power of the British monarch during the civil wars of 1642\u221251, and its passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689 made possible the Glorious Revolution, which rendered Parliament, and not the monarch, Great Britain\u2019s ruling power. The right to vote in Britain was expanded through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries, further reinforcing Parliament\u2019s power and underscoring the place of representative democracy in Britain. The United States and France are republics that have played an important role in the adoption and spread of representative democracy. Following the American Revolution, the United States adopted a new constitution in 1787 that adopted principles of representative democracy, with members of the House of Representatives directly elected by citizens with the right to vote. (Members of the Senate were elected indirectly until 1913.) Voting rights expanded over time to include women, men who did not own property, and Black people, among other groups. France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789, and the deputies that made up the short-lived National Convention were elected through universal male suffrage in 1792. Those voting rights subsequently eroded, however, until the revolution of 1848 resulted in their reinstatement; nearly a century later, suffrage was granted to women\n\nquestion: What does the constitution provide for in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "new constitution adopted principles of representative democracy", "usage": 1120}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Modern representative democracies have come into being through a variety of political institutions, most of which made their first appearance in Europe and the United States in the 18th century. The concept of representation is itself the most important, because it enables government officials who are elected by citizens to make major decisions and establish policies. Important institutions include: More than half of the world\u2019s countries are some form of representative democracy. Some are parliamentary constitutional monarchies, in which the head of state is a hereditary monarch and most or all political decisions and initiatives are the responsibility of an elected parliament. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands fall in this category. Countries such as Germany and India are federal parliamentary republics, which typically have a bicameral parliament. In a bicameral parliament, one of the houses (typically called the lower house) is directly elected by the country\u2019s citizens. The other house (the upper house) is elected by representatives of individual states or regions of the country. Since the regional representatives are in turn elected by citizens of those regions, the upper house is indirectly elected by the people. Federal parliamentary republics allow for each state or region to have a say in decisions made at the national, or federal, level. The United Kingdom also has a bicameral legislature, but the upper house, the House of Lords, is not an elected body, its members taking their positions by appointment or on account of a hereditary seat. France follows a semi-presidential republic model in which the president is a popularly (and directly) elected head of state, but the president\u2019s cabinet is responsible to an elected legislature, the National Assembly, which in turn supports the appointment of a prime minister. In contrast, the United States is a presidential republic system, in which the president is popularly elected and can appoint a cabinet but exists separately from elected federal legislative bodies (the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives). A representative democracy allows voters the opportunity to elect their preferred representative, who is then expected to follow the will of the electorate in making decisions. Thus citizens remove themselves from the strain of day-to-day decision making, while retaining the right to voice their opinions and to campaign or lobby for their points of view. Representatives can shape laws and policies in a way that gives the greatest benefit to the most people. However, once elected, representatives are not legally obligated to reflect the will of the people. The lure of political influence, monetary gain, and other factors can result in accusations of corruption or undue influence and damage the integrity of an elected institution. Elected representatives may choose to not honour their promises, safe in the knowledge that their position is secure until the next election. A disconnect from political processes can also lead to apathy among citizens, reducing their incentive to vote or otherwise participate in elections and other decision-making processes. Lastly, the election of representatives can deeply polarize citizens, especially in instances in which the election result was a narrow call, or disputed, leading to doubts over a representative\u2019s victory. In such cases, a significant portion of the population may feel unrepresented or neglected by the elected representative, resulting in citizens\u2019 apathy or in attempts by them to have their voices heard, such as protests or strikes.\n\nquestion: What does the constitution provide for in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "presidential republic system", "usage": 737}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Nearly all modern Western-style democracies function as some type of representative democracy: for example, the United Kingdom (a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy), Germany (a federal parliamentary republic), France (a unitary semi-presidential republic), and the United States (a federal presidential republic). Representative democracy places power in the hands of representatives who are elected by the people. Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives). Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy. Representative democracy can be organized in different ways, including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber or two chambers. Where two chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways. The power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power: Theorists such as Edmund Burke believe that part of the duty of a representative was not simply to communicate the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters: Certainly, Gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a Representative, to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the Law and the Constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. The Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly. A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems. In Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments. The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns. Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries. The American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and Black people, and others not originally given voting rights, in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Until it was repealed by the Fourteenth Amendment following the Civil War, the Three-Fifths Compromise gave a disproportionate representation of slave states in the House of Representatives relative to the voters in free states. In 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all males in 1792. Universal male suffrage was re-established in France in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848. Representative democracy came into general favour particularly in post-industrial revolution nation states\n\nquestion: What does the constitution provide for in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "A balance of representative power.", "usage": 1126}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Many historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern representative democracy in the United Kingdom. Globally, a majority of governments in the world are representative democracies, including constitutional monarchies and republics with strong representative branches. Separate but related, and very large, bodies of research in political philosophy and social science investigate how and how well elected representatives, such as legislators, represent the interests or preferences of one or another constituency. The empirical research shows that representative systems tend to be biased towards the representation of more affluent classes, to the detriment of the population at large. In his book Political Parties, written in 1911, Robert Michels argues that most representative systems deteriorate towards an oligarchy or particracy. This is known as the iron law of oligarchy. Representative democracies which are stable have been analysed by Adolf Gasser and compared to the unstable representative democracies in his book Gemeindefreiheit als Rettung Europas which was published in 1943 and a second edition in 1947. Adolf Gasser stated the following requirements for a representative democracy in order to remain stable, unaffected by the iron law of oligarchy: A drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance. Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized. Proponents of direct democracy criticize representative democracy due to its inherent structure. As the fundamental basis of representative democracy is non inclusive system, in which representatives turn into an elite class that works behind closed doors, as well as the criticizing the elector system as being driven by a capitalistic and authoritarian system. The system of stochocracy has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected. Stochocracy aims to at least reduce this degradation by having all representatives appointed by lottery instead of by voting. Therefore, this system is also called lottocracy. The system was proposed by the writer Roger de Sizif in 1998 in his book La Stochocratie. Choosing officeholders by lot was also the standard practice in ancient Athenian democracy and in ancient India. The rationale behind this practice was to avoid lobbying and electioneering by economic oligarchs. The system of deliberative democracy is a mix between a majority-ruled system and a consensus-based system. It allows for representative democracies or direct democracies to coexist with its system of governance, providing an initial advantage.\n\nquestion: What does the constitution provide for in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 646}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

What we eat, where we go to school, what kind of education we receive, how our tax money is spent, and what we do in our free time are all affected by government. Americans are often unaware of the pervasiveness of government in their everyday lives, and many are unsure precisely what it does. Here we will look at what government is, what it does, and how the government of the United States differs from other kinds of governments. The term government describes the means by which a society organizes itself and how it allocates authority in order to accomplish collective goals and provide benefits that the society as a whole needs. Among the goals that governments around the world seek to accomplish are economic prosperity, secure national borders, and the safety and well-being of citizens. Governments also provide benefits for their citizens. The type of benefits provided differ according to the country and their specific type of governmental system, but governments commonly provide such things as education, health care, and an infrastructure for transportation. The term politics refers to the process of gaining and exercising control within a government for the purpose of setting and achieving particular goals, especially those related to the division of resources within a nation. Sometimes governmental systems are confused with economic systems. This is because certain types of political thought or governmental organization are closely related to or develop with certain types of economic systems. For example, the economic system of capitalism in Western Europe and North America developed at roughly the same time as ideas about democratic republics, self-government, and natural rights. At this time, the idea of liberty became an important concept. According to John Locke, an English political philosopher of the seventeenth century, all people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. From this came the idea that people should be free to consent to being governed. In the eighteenth century, in Great Britain\u2019s North American colonies, and later in France, this developed into the idea that people should govern themselves through elected representatives and not a king; only those representatives chosen by the people had the right to make laws to govern them. Similarly, Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher who was born nineteen years after Locke\u2019s death, believed that all people should be free to acquire property in any way that they wished. Instead of being controlled by government, business, and industry, Smith argued, people should be allowed to operate as they wish and keep the proceeds of their work. Competition would ensure that prices remained low and faulty goods disappeared from the market. In this way, businesses would reap profits, consumers would have their needs satisfied, and society as a whole would prosper. Smith discussed these ideas, which formed the basis for industrial capitalism, in his book The Wealth of Nations, which was published in 1776, the same year that the Declaration of Independence was written. Representative government and capitalism developed together in the United States, and many Americans tend to equate democracy, a political system in which people govern themselves, with capitalism. In theory, a democratic government promotes individualism and the freedom to act as one chooses instead of being controlled, for good or bad, by government. Capitalism, in turn, relies on individualism. At the same time, successful capitalists prefer political systems over which they can exert at least some influence in order to maintain their liberty. Democracy and capitalism do not have to go hand in hand, however. Indeed, one might argue that a capitalist economic system might be bad for democracy in some respects. Although Smith theorized that capitalism would lead to prosperity for all, this has not necessarily been the case. Great gaps in wealth between the owners of major businesses, industries, and financial institutions and those who work for others in exchange for wages exist in many capitalist nations. In turn, great wealth may give a very small minority great influence over the government\u2014a greater influence than that held by the majority of the population, which will be discussed later. Socialism is an alternative economic system. In socialist societies, the means of generating wealth, such as factories, large farms, and banks, are owned by the government and not by private individuals. The government accumulates wealth and then redistributes it to citizens, primarily in the form of social programs that provide such things as free or inexpensive health care, education, and childcare. In socialist countries, the government also usually owns and controls utilities such as electricity, transportation systems like airlines and railroads, and telecommunications systems. In many socialist countries the government is an oligarchy: only members of a certain political party or ruling elite can participate in government. For example, in China, the government is run by members of the Chinese Communist Party. In the United States, the democratic government works closely together with its capitalist economic system. The interconnectedness of the two affects the way in which goods and services are distributed. The market provides many goods and services needed by Americans. For example, food, clothing, and housing are provided in ample supply by private businesses that earn a profit in return. These\n\nquestion: Where does legal power usually remain in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "legal power usually remains in the United States.", "usage": 1112}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This, of course, is the ideal. In reality, those who live in poverty cannot always afford to buy ample food and clothing to meet their needs, or the food and clothing that they can afford to buy in abundance is of inferior quality. Also, it is often difficult to find adequate housing; housing in the most desirable neighborhoods\u2014those that have low crime rates and good schools\u2014is often too expensive for poor or working-class (and sometimes middle-class) people to buy or rent. Thus, the market cannot provide everything (in enough quantity or at low enough costs) in order to meet everyone\u2019s needs. Therefore, some goods are provided by the government. Such goods or services that are available to all without charge are called public goods. Two such public goods are national security and education. It is difficult to see how a private business could protect the United States from attack. How could it build its own armies and create plans for defense and attack? Who would pay the men and women who served? Where would the intelligence come from? Due to its ability to tax, draw upon the resources of an entire nation, and compel citizen compliance, only government is capable of protecting the nation. Similarly, public schools provide education for all children in the United States. Children of all religions, races and ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, and levels of academic ability can attend public schools free of charge from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. It would be impossible for private schools to provide an education for all of the nation\u2019s children. Private schools do provide some education in the United States; however, they charge tuition, and only those parents who can afford to pay their fees (or whose children gain a scholarship) can attend these institutions. Some schools charge very high tuition, the equivalent to the tuition at a private college. If private schools were the only educational institutions, most poor and working-class children and many middle-class children would be uneducated. Private schooling is a type of good called a toll good. Toll goods are available to many people, and many people can make use of them, but only if they can pay the price. They occupy a middle ground between public and private goods. All parents may send their children to public schools in the United States. They can choose to send their children to a private school, but the private school will charge them. On the other hand, public schools, which are operated by the government, provide free education so all children can attend school. Therefore, everyone in the nation benefits from the educated voters and workers produced by the public school system. Another distinction between public and private goods is that public goods are available to all, typically without additional charge. What other public goods does government provide in the United States? At the federal, state, and local level, government provides stability and security, not only in the form of a military but also in the form of police and fire departments. Government provides other valuable goods and services such as public education, public transportation, mail service, and food, housing, and health care for the poor (Figure 1.2). If a house catches on fire, the fire department does not demand payment before they put the fire out. If someone breaks into a house and tries to harm the occupants, the police will try to protect them and arrest the intruder, but the police department will not request payment for services rendered. The provision of these goods and services is funded by citizens paying into the general tax base. Government also performs the important job of protecting common goods: goods that all people may use free of charge but that are of limited supply, such as fish in the sea or clean drinking water. Because everyone can use these goods, they must be protected so a few people do not take everything that is available and leave others with nothing. Some examples of common goods, private goods, public goods, and toll goods are listed below (Figure 1.3). This federal website shares information about the many services the government provides. One of the many important things government does is regulate public access to common goods like natural resources. Unlike public goods, which all people may use without charge, common goods are in limited supply. If more public schools are needed, the government can build more. If more firefighters or mail carriers are needed, the government can hire them. Public lands and wildlife, however, are not goods the government can simply multiply if supply falls due to demand. Indeed, if some people take too freely from the supply of common goods, there will not be enough left for others to use. Fish are one of the many common goods in which the government currently regulates access. It does so to ensure that certain species are not fished into extinction, thus depriving future generations of an important food source and a means to make a living. This idea is known as sustainability. Environmentalists want to set strict fishing limits on a variety of species. Commercial fishers resist these limits, claiming they are\n\nquestion: Where does legal power usually remain in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "federal, state, and local level", "usage": 1111}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Currently, fishing limits are set by a combination of scientists, politicians, local resource managers, and groups representing the interests of fishers.3 Should the government regulate fishing? Is it right to interfere with people\u2019s ability to earn money today in order to protect the access of future generations to the nation\u2019s common goods? Besides providing stability and goods and services for all, government also creates a structure by which goods and services can be made available to the people. In the United States, people elect representatives to city councils, state legislatures, and Congress. These bodies make laws to govern their respective jurisdictions. They also pass measures to raise money, through the imposition of taxes on such things as income, property, and sales. Local, state, and national governments also draft budgets to determine how the revenue taken in will be spent for services. On the local level, funds are allotted for education, police and fire departments, and maintenance of public parks. State governments allocate money for state colleges and universities, maintenance of state roads and bridges, and wildlife management, among other priorities. On the national level, money goes to such things as defense, Social Security, pensions for veterans, maintenance of federal courts and prisons, and management of national parks. At each level, representatives elected by the people try to secure funding for things that will benefit those who live in the areas they represent. Once money has been allocated, government agencies at each level then receive funds for the purposes mentioned above and use them to provide services to the public. Local, state, and national governments also make laws to maintain order and to ensure the efficient functioning of society, including the fair operation of the business marketplace. In the United States, for example, Congress passes laws regulating banking, and government agencies regulate such things as the amount of toxic gases that can be emitted by factories, the purity of food offered for sale, and the safety of toys and automobiles. In this way, government checks the actions of business, something that it would not do if capitalism in the United States functioned strictly in the manner that Adam Smith believed it should\u2026almost entirely unregulated. Besides providing goods to citizens and maintaining public safety, most governments also provide a means for citizens to participate in government and to make their opinions known to those in power. Western democracies like the United States, Britain, France, and others protect citizens\u2019 freedom of speech and the press. These nations, and others in the world, also allow citizens to vote. As noted earlier, politics is the process by which choices are made regarding how resources will be allocated and which economic and social policies government will pursue. Put more simply, politics is the process of who gets what and how. Politics involves choosing which values government will support and which it will not. If government chooses to support an ideal such as individualism, it may choose to loosen regulations on business and industry or to cut taxes so that people have more money to invest in business. If it chooses to support an ideal such as egalitarianism, which calls for equal treatment for all and the destruction of socioeconomic inequalities, it may raise taxes in order to be able to spend more on public education, public transportation, housing for the poor, and care for the elderly. If, for example, the government is more concerned with national security than with individual liberty, it may authorize the tapping of people\u2019s phones and restrict what newspapers may publish. If liberty is more important, then government will place greater restrictions on the extent that law enforcement agencies can intrude upon citizens\u2019 private communications. The political process and the input of citizens help determine the answer. Civic engagement, or the participation that connects citizens to government, is a vital ingredient of politics. In the United States, citizens play an important role in influencing what policies are pursued, what values the government chooses to support, what initiatives are granted funding, and who gets to make the final decisions. Political engagement can take many forms: reading about politics, listening to news reports, discussing politics, attending (or watching televised) political debates, donating money to political campaigns, handing out flyers promoting a candidate, voting, joining protest marches, and writing letters to their elected representatives. The government of the United States can best be described as a republic, or representative democracy. A democracy is a government in which political power\u2014influence over institutions, leaders, and policies\u2014rests in the hands of the people. In a representative democracy, however, the citizens do not govern directly. Instead, they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf. Most representative governments favor majority rule: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority. If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it\n\nquestion: Where does legal power usually remain in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "in the hands of the people", "usage": 1112}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

However, in representative governments like the United States, minority rights are protected: people cannot be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be. For example, let\u2019s say American society decided that atheists, people who do not believe that God exists, were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country. Even though atheists only account for about 7 percent of the population, they would be protected due to minority rights.4 Even though the number of Americans who believe in God far outweighs the number who do not, the minority is still protected. Because decisions are made through majority rule, making your opinions known and voting for those men and women who make decisions that affect all of us are critical and influential forms of civic engagement in a representative democracy such as the United States. In a direct democracy, unlike representative democracy, people participate directly in making government decisions. For example, in ancient Athens, the most famous example of a direct democracy, all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly. Here they debated and voted for or against all proposed laws. Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy\u2014the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government\u2014some elements of direct democracy do exist in the United States. While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress, people may still directly vote on certain issues. For example, a referendum or proposed law might be placed on the ballot for citizens to vote on directly during state or local elections instead of leaving the matter in the hands of the state legislature. At New England town meetings, all residents are allowed to debate decisions affecting the town (Figure 1.5). Such occasions provide additional opportunities for civic engagement. Most countries now have some form of representative government.5 At the other end of the political spectrum are elite-driven forms of government. In a monarchy, one ruler, usually a hereditary ruler, holds political power. Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law, and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country, this is not always the case. Many southwest Asian kingdoms, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted. As discussed earlier, another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy, in which a handful of elite members of society, often those who belong to a particular political party, hold all political power. For example, in Cuba, as in China, only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office, and the party\u2019s most important members make all government decisions. Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature. Under totalitarianism, the government is more important than the citizens, and it controls all aspects of citizens\u2019 lives. Citizens\u2019 rights are limited, and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition. These forms of government are fairly rare. North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government. The CIA website provides information about the types of government across the world. As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.

The elected representatives are in turn accountable to the electorate for their actions. As a form of democracy, representative democracy exists in contrast to direct democracy, in which all citizens directly vote on laws to be passed and other issues. Most modern countries are representative democracies, and, as such, they face many challenges. Ancient Rome practiced the earliest known form of representative democracy in the Western world. The Romans called their state a republic (from the Latin respublica, meaning, literally, \u201ca thing that belongs to the people\u201d). During the era of the Roman Republic, which began in 509 bce, meetings were held in a public space, known as the forum, at the centre of each city within Roman territory. Citizenship was typically conferred by birth to all men if both parents were Roman citizens, though one of them, usually the mother, could be an alien with the right to contract a Roman marriage. Citizenship was also granted by naturalization and by manumission of enslaved people. As the republic evolved, Roman government came to have four assemblies along with the Senate, which had existed in various forms for centuries. The four assemblies, or comitia, were the Comitia Curiata, drawn from men claiming affiliation with one of several tribal groups (believed to be three groups originally created by Romulus); the Comitia Centuriata, made up of military units; the Concilium Plebis, consisting of plebeians; and the Comitia Tributa, open to any citizen. Votes within these assemblies were counted by groups, variously defined, rather than by the individuals who made up these groups. Senators were chosen indirectly by the Comitia Centuriata and exercised significant power\u2014far more than the assemblies, which ostensibly represented all Roman citizens. By the 3rd century bce, all Roman citizens had been enfranchised, but the value of the voting right was related to wealth. Women lacked any voice in public life and had no voting rights, being at all times subject to the authority of a man, typically their father or husband. As Rome expanded across Italy, new subjects were allowed to govern their own affairs while enjoying most rights of Roman citizenship except the right to vote. Latin allies who moved to Rome permanently gained full citizenship. Allies bound to Rome by treaty did not enjoy full rights but were required to pay taxes or tribute as well as provide military service; these allies revolted against their inferior social status, leading to the Social War (90\u201389 bce), at the end of which full citizenship was given to all men of Italy, sans those who were enslaved, south of the Po River. The purpose of, and power wielded by, the comitia changed after the republic collapsed and was replaced by the Roman Empire in 27 bce. This Roman form of democracy became the basis for most modern representative democracies. The Italian city-states that rose up in the centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire in western Europe, such as Venice and Florence, held elections for their leaders and called themselves republics, but they limited citizen participation to only a fraction of their male population. In medieval England, Simon de Montfort played a role in two parliaments that are considered important to the development of representative democracy. The first, in 1258, consisted of a group of barons who removed from King Henry III his unlimited powers through what was, in effect, England\u2019s first written constitution. The second, in 1265, included citizens from English towns. During the 17th century, Parliament opposed the power of the British monarch during the civil wars of 1642\u221251, and its passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689 made possible the Glorious Revolution, which rendered Parliament, and not the monarch, Great Britain\u2019s ruling power. The right to vote in Britain was expanded through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries, further reinforcing Parliament\u2019s power and underscoring the place of representative democracy in Britain. The United States and France are republics that have played an important role in the adoption and spread of representative democracy. Following the American Revolution, the United States adopted a new constitution in 1787 that adopted principles of representative democracy, with members of the House of Representatives directly elected by citizens with the right to vote. (Members of the Senate were elected indirectly until 1913.) Voting rights expanded over time to include women, men who did not own property, and Black people, among other groups. France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789, and the deputies that made up the short-lived National Convention were elected through universal male suffrage in 1792. Those voting rights subsequently eroded, however, until the revolution of 1848 resulted in their reinstatement; nearly a century later, suffrage was granted to women\n\nquestion: Where does legal power usually remain in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Parliament", "usage": 1115}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Modern representative democracies have come into being through a variety of political institutions, most of which made their first appearance in Europe and the United States in the 18th century. The concept of representation is itself the most important, because it enables government officials who are elected by citizens to make major decisions and establish policies. Important institutions include: More than half of the world\u2019s countries are some form of representative democracy. Some are parliamentary constitutional monarchies, in which the head of state is a hereditary monarch and most or all political decisions and initiatives are the responsibility of an elected parliament. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands fall in this category. Countries such as Germany and India are federal parliamentary republics, which typically have a bicameral parliament. In a bicameral parliament, one of the houses (typically called the lower house) is directly elected by the country\u2019s citizens. The other house (the upper house) is elected by representatives of individual states or regions of the country. Since the regional representatives are in turn elected by citizens of those regions, the upper house is indirectly elected by the people. Federal parliamentary republics allow for each state or region to have a say in decisions made at the national, or federal, level. The United Kingdom also has a bicameral legislature, but the upper house, the House of Lords, is not an elected body, its members taking their positions by appointment or on account of a hereditary seat. France follows a semi-presidential republic model in which the president is a popularly (and directly) elected head of state, but the president\u2019s cabinet is responsible to an elected legislature, the National Assembly, which in turn supports the appointment of a prime minister. In contrast, the United States is a presidential republic system, in which the president is popularly elected and can appoint a cabinet but exists separately from elected federal legislative bodies (the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives). A representative democracy allows voters the opportunity to elect their preferred representative, who is then expected to follow the will of the electorate in making decisions. Thus citizens remove themselves from the strain of day-to-day decision making, while retaining the right to voice their opinions and to campaign or lobby for their points of view. Representatives can shape laws and policies in a way that gives the greatest benefit to the most people. However, once elected, representatives are not legally obligated to reflect the will of the people. The lure of political influence, monetary gain, and other factors can result in accusations of corruption or undue influence and damage the integrity of an elected institution. Elected representatives may choose to not honour their promises, safe in the knowledge that their position is secure until the next election. A disconnect from political processes can also lead to apathy among citizens, reducing their incentive to vote or otherwise participate in elections and other decision-making processes. Lastly, the election of representatives can deeply polarize citizens, especially in instances in which the election result was a narrow call, or disputed, leading to doubts over a representative\u2019s victory. In such cases, a significant portion of the population may feel unrepresented or neglected by the elected representative, resulting in citizens\u2019 apathy or in attempts by them to have their voices heard, such as protests or strikes.\n\nquestion: Where does legal power usually remain in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Separately from elected federal legislative bodies.", "usage": 741}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Nearly all modern Western-style democracies function as some type of representative democracy: for example, the United Kingdom (a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy), Germany (a federal parliamentary republic), France (a unitary semi-presidential republic), and the United States (a federal presidential republic). Representative democracy places power in the hands of representatives who are elected by the people. Political parties often become central to this form of democracy if electoral systems require or encourage voters to vote for political parties or for candidates associated with political parties (as opposed to voting for individual representatives). Some political theorists (including Robert Dahl, Gregory Houston, and Ian Liebenberg) have described representative democracy as polyarchy. Representative democracy can be organized in different ways, including both parliamentary and presidential systems of government. Elected representatives typically form a legislature (such as a parliament or congress), which may be composed of a single chamber or two chambers. Where two chambers exist, their members are often elected in different ways. The power of representatives is usually curtailed by a constitution (as in a constitutional democracy or a constitutional monarchy) or other measures to balance representative power: Theorists such as Edmund Burke believe that part of the duty of a representative was not simply to communicate the wishes of the electorate but also to use their own judgment in the exercise of their powers, even if their views are not reflective of those of a majority of voters: Certainly, Gentlemen, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a Representative, to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the Law and the Constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion. The Roman Republic was the first known state in the Western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the Roman assemblies. The Roman model of governance would inspire many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek model, because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which people vote for representatives who then vote on policy initiatives; as opposed to direct democracy, a form of democracy in which people vote on policy initiatives directly. A European medieval tradition of selecting representatives from the various estates (classes, but not as we know them today) to advise/control monarchs led to relatively wide familiarity with representative systems inspired by Roman systems. In Britain, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the fathers of representative government for holding two famous parliaments. The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns. Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England implemented some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy, culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. Widening of the voting franchise took place through a series of Reform Acts in the 19th and 20th centuries. The American Revolution led to the creation of a new Constitution of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office. Senators were not directly elected by the people until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. Women, men who owned no property, and Black people, and others not originally given voting rights, in most states eventually gained the vote through changes in state and federal law in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries. Until it was repealed by the Fourteenth Amendment following the Civil War, the Three-Fifths Compromise gave a disproportionate representation of slave states in the House of Representatives relative to the voters in free states. In 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all males in 1792. Universal male suffrage was re-established in France in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848. Representative democracy came into general favour particularly in post-industrial revolution nation states\n\nquestion: Where does legal power usually remain in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "in the hands of representatives who are elected by the people.", "usage": 1132}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Many historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern representative democracy in the United Kingdom. Globally, a majority of governments in the world are representative democracies, including constitutional monarchies and republics with strong representative branches. Separate but related, and very large, bodies of research in political philosophy and social science investigate how and how well elected representatives, such as legislators, represent the interests or preferences of one or another constituency. The empirical research shows that representative systems tend to be biased towards the representation of more affluent classes, to the detriment of the population at large. In his book Political Parties, written in 1911, Robert Michels argues that most representative systems deteriorate towards an oligarchy or particracy. This is known as the iron law of oligarchy. Representative democracies which are stable have been analysed by Adolf Gasser and compared to the unstable representative democracies in his book Gemeindefreiheit als Rettung Europas which was published in 1943 and a second edition in 1947. Adolf Gasser stated the following requirements for a representative democracy in order to remain stable, unaffected by the iron law of oligarchy: A drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance. Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized. Proponents of direct democracy criticize representative democracy due to its inherent structure. As the fundamental basis of representative democracy is non inclusive system, in which representatives turn into an elite class that works behind closed doors, as well as the criticizing the elector system as being driven by a capitalistic and authoritarian system. The system of stochocracy has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected. Stochocracy aims to at least reduce this degradation by having all representatives appointed by lottery instead of by voting. Therefore, this system is also called lottocracy. The system was proposed by the writer Roger de Sizif in 1998 in his book La Stochocratie. Choosing officeholders by lot was also the standard practice in ancient Athenian democracy and in ancient India. The rationale behind this practice was to avoid lobbying and electioneering by economic oligarchs. The system of deliberative democracy is a mix between a majority-ruled system and a consensus-based system. It allows for representative democracies or direct democracies to coexist with its system of governance, providing an initial advantage.\n\nquestion: Where does legal power usually remain in the United States?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 646}, "Your task is to judge whether the following two answers are factually consistent.
