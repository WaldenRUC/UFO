It stars Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, Madonna, Lori Petty, Rosie O'Donnell, Jon Lovitz, David Strathairn, Garry Marshall, and Bill Pullman. It was written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel from a story by Kelly Candaele and Kim Wilson. A League of Their Own was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $132.4 million worldwide and garnering acclaim for Marshall's direction and the performances of its ensemble cast. In 2012, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 1988, Dottie Hinson attends the opening of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League exhibit at the Baseball Hall of Fame. She sees many former teammates and friends, prompting a flashback to 1943. When World War II threatens to shut down Major League Baseball, Chicago Cubs owner Walter Harvey persuades his fellow owners to bankroll a women's league. Ira Lowenstein is put in charge. Scout Ernie Capadino attends an industrial-league softball game in Oregon and likes what he sees in Dottie, the catcher for a local dairy. She is not interested; she is happy with her life while waiting for her husband Bob to return from the war. Her younger sister Kit Keller, however, is desperate to get away and make something of herself. Capadino is unimpressed by Kit's batting and refuses to watch her pitch, but agrees to take her along if she changes Dottie's mind. Dottie agrees for her sister's sake. Dottie and Kit travel to Harvey Field in Chicago for the tryout. They meet taxi dancer Mae \"All the Way Mae\" Mordabito and her best friend, bouncer Doris Murphy, soft-spoken right fielder Evelyn Gardner, illiterate left fielder Shirley Baker, pitcher/shortstop and former Miss Georgia beauty queen Ellen Sue Gotlander, left field/relief pitcher Betty \"Spaghetti\" Horn, second baseman Marla Hooch, first baseman Helen Haley, and Alice \"Skeeter\" Gaspers. They and five others constitute the Rockford Peaches, while 48 others make up the Racine Belles, Kenosha Comets, and South Bend Blue Sox. The Peaches are managed by former star Cubs slugger Jimmy Dugan, a cynical alcoholic. He initially treats the whole thing as a joke, forcing Dottie to take over as on-field leader initially. Dugan is also abrasive toward his players. The team travels with Evelyn's spoiled bratty son Stillwell and tightly wound team chaperone Miss Cuthburt. With a Life magazine photographer in the stands, Lowenstein begs the players to do something spectacular, as the league has attracted little attention. Dottie obliges, catching a popped-up ball behind home plate while doing a split. The resulting photograph makes the magazine cover. A publicity campaign draws more people to the ballgames, but the owners remain unconvinced. The teammates bond. Marla marries a man named Nelson whom she met on a raucous roadhouse outing and leaves the team for the rest of the season, Mae teaches Shirley to read, and Evelyn writes a team song. Lowenstein makes Dottie the face of the league, making Kit resentful. Their sibling rivalry intensifies, resulting in Kit's trade to the Racine Belles. The Peaches end the season with the league's best record, qualifying for the World Series. Jimmy gives Betty a telegram informing her that her husband was killed in action in the Pacific Theater. Grief-stricken, she leaves the team. That evening, Dottie receives a surprise when Bob shows up, having been wounded and discharged from the Army. Jimmy discovers that Dottie is going home with Bob. Unable to persuade her to play in the World Series, he tells her she will regret her decision. The Peaches face the Belles in the World Series, which goes the full seven games. Dottie rejoins the Peaches for the seventh game, while Kit is the starting pitcher for the Belles. With the Belles leading by a run in the top of the ninth, Dottie drives in the go-ahead run. Kit is distraught, but gets a second chance when she comes to bat with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. She gets a hit and, ignoring the third base coach's sign to stop, scores the winning run by knocking her sister over at the plate and dislodging the ball from Dottie's hand. The sellout crowd convinces Harvey to give Lowenstein the owners' support. After the game, the sisters reconcile before Dottie leaves with Bob.

The surviving Peaches sing Evelyn's team song and pose for a photo. During the closing credits, they play baseball at Doubleday Field. Director Penny Marshall was inspired by the 1987 TV documentary A League of their Own, about the AAGPBL. She had never heard of the league, and contacted the film's creators, Kelly Candaele and Kim Wilson, to collaborate with the scriptwriters, Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz, on producing a screenplay for 20th Century Fox. Fox eventually passed on the script and Marshall signed with Sony Pictures, who were eager to produce it. On MLB Network's Costas at the Movies in 2013, director Penny Marshall talked about her initial interest in Demi Moore for the part of Dottie Hinson: \"Demi Moore, I liked, but by the time we came around, she was pregnant.\" Debra Winger was then cast as Dottie and spent three months training with the Chicago Cubs in preparation. However, she dropped out of the production four weeks before the start of principal photography, later saying that the casting of Madonna was the reason for her decision. Marshall chose Geena Davis to replace Winger. USC assistant baseball coach Bill Hughes was the film's technical adviser and put the film's ensemble cast through baseball camp three months before filming. Principal photography began July 10, 1991. Filming the game scenes involved many physical mishaps: Anne Ramsay (Helen Haley) broke her nose with a baseball mitt while trying to catch a ball, and the large bruise seen on actress Ren\u00e9e Coleman's thigh was real. Discussing the skirts they wore playing in the film, Geena Davis said on MLB Network's Costas at the Movies in 2013, \"Some of our real cast, from sliding into home, had ripped the skin off their legs. It was nutty.\" In a 2021 interview, Petty claimed to have broken her foot during filming, but reiterated her enjoyment of the shoot and the understanding of the film's importance at the time. The tryout scene, at a fictional Major League Baseball stadium in Chicago called Harvey Field, was filmed at the Chicago Cubs' home stadium, Wrigley Field. The Rockford Peaches' home games were filmed at League Stadium in Huntingburg, Indiana, and the championship game against Racine was filmed at Bosse Field in Evansville, Indiana. Additional games were filmed at Jay Littleton Ball Park in Ontario, California. The house where the Rockford Peaches lived is in Henderson, Kentucky; in addition to interior shots, the exterior of the house is visible both when one of the team members weds and drives off with her husband and when Dottie is leaving with her husband. The final week of shooting was during late October 1991 in Cooperstown, New York, where 65 original AAGPBL members appeared in scenes recreating the induction of the league into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988. Due to the length of the schedule, the cast entertained themselves by putting on an elaborate amateur production, \"Jesus Christ Superstar Goes Hawaiian.\" A League of Their Own soundtrack was released on CD and cassette tape by Columbia Records on June 30, 1992. The album peaked at #159 on the US Billboard 200 albums chart on July 25, 1992. Although Madonna contributed \"This Used to Be My Playground\" to the film, featured over the closing credits, her recording was not included on the soundtrack album for contractual reasons. A League of Their Own was released on July 1, 1992, and grossed $13.2 million in its first weekend, finishing second at the box office behind Batman Returns. In its second weekend it dropped just 15%, making $11.5 million and finishing first. It ended up a commercial success, making $107.5 million in the United States and Canada, but only $24.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $132.4 million against a production budget of $40 million. The film was well received by critics, who praised the cast. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 81% based on 79 reviews, with an average score of 7/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Sentimental and light, but still thoroughly charming, A League of Their Own is buoyed by solid performances from a wonderful cast.\" On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 69 based 21 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote: \"Though big of budget, A League of Their Own is one of the year's most cheerful, most relaxed, most easily enjoyable comedies.

What's fresh are the personalities of the players, the gradual unfolding of their coach and the way this early chapter of women's liberation fit into the hidebound traditions of professional baseball.\" On December 19, 2012, it was announced that A League of Their Own would be preserved in the United States National Film Registry. Jimmy Dugan's (Tom Hanks) remark to Evelyn Gardner (Bitty Schram), \"There's no crying in baseball!\", was ranked 54th on the American Film Institute's 2005 list AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. A League of Their Own was released as a 20th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray on October 16, 2012. 47 former AAGPBL players reunited in New York to celebrate the film and the real women who inspired it. Events included a trip to Cooperstown for a special program at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, reminiscent of the film's final scene depicting AAGPBL players and family meeting to honor the Women's Professional Baseball League. The reunion wrapped up with a game of softball held at Alliance Bank Stadium in nearby Syracuse. Former players also made an appearance at Bosse Field in Evansville, Indiana on June 6, 2012, where many of the film's game scenes were filmed. Bosse Field still retains many of the Racine Belles themes from the movie. The event included an outdoor screening of the film, and a display of cars featured in the film. In addition to Bosse Field, the production used Huntingburg, Indiana's League Stadium, another Southwestern Indiana field older than Bosse, that was renovated for it. A short-lived series of the same title based on the film aired on CBS in April 1993, with Garry Marshall, Megan Cavanagh, Tracy Reiner, Freddie Simpson, and Jon Lovitz reprising their roles. Carey Lowell took over Geena Davis's role. Only five of the six episodes made were broadcast. On August 6, 2020, Amazon Video ordered a reboot series with the same title as the movie. The series debuted on August 12, 2022, on Amazon. The series was renewed in March 2023 for a four-episode final season, but in August 2023, Amazon announced that the second season would be scrapped due to delays caused by the WGA strike.\n\nquestion: What time period is 'A League of Their Own' set in?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "WWII", "usage": 625}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The eight-episode TV show, now available to stream in full, offers a new spin on the beloved 1992 Penny Marshall film of the same name that tells the (mostly) true story of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) founded by Philip K. Wrigley, the gum magnate and Chicago Cubs owner, during World War II. The series isn\u2019t a remake of the beloved 30-year-old film starring Geena Davis, Madonna, and Rosie O\u2019Donnell, but a \u201creimagining,\u201d according to the show\u2019s co-creator and star Abbi Jacobson. \u201cWe are really attempting to tell the stories that were missing from the film, and about this league in particular,\u201d she told Entertainment Tonight earlier this month. The new A League of Their Own, like its predecessor, follows the Rockford Peaches over the course of the league\u2019s 1943 inaugural season. Yet the historical dramedy does so with a more inclusive purview and cast, focusing on two topics the film all but ignores: race and sexuality. The show stars Jacobson as Carson, the Peaches\u2019 starting catcher, whose acceptance into the league allows her a chance not just to play professional baseball but to broaden her sexual horizons. The series also tells the parallel story of Max, a talented pitcher, played by Chant\u00e9 Adams, who isn\u2019t allowed to try out for the AAGPBL because she is Black. The rejection puts her on a different path toward becoming a professional ball player and a journey toward redefining her gender identity. Both of these characters offer a modern take on the overlooked and misunderstood women of the AAGPBL, as well as a loving addendum to Marshall\u2019s film. Ultimately, A League of Their Own differs from the movie, but it stays true to history. Black women were denied the chance to try out for the AAGPBL because, like Major League Baseball in the early \u201840s, it was informally segregated. (The MLB\u2019s color barrier was broken in 1947 when Jackie Robinson signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers.) The original movie touches on this fact very briefly in a scene in which a Black woman (played by DeLisa Chinn-Tyler) sitting in the segregated area of the ballpark\u2019s stands throws a foul ball back to Rockford Peaches pitcher Ellen Sue (Freddie Simpson) with such force that it stings her hand. \u201cIt did bother us that in order to be historically accurate, we could not have a diverse cast,\u201d screenwriter Lowell Ganz told Buzzfeed in 2017. The less than 15-second scene was Ganz and his co-writer Babaloo Mandel\u2019s way of acknowledging the racial injustices of the AAGPBL, which did allow white-passing Latinas to play. Thirty years later, the Amazon series expands upon the memorable moment to show that despite being unable to play for the league, which ran for 12 seasons between 1943 and 1954, there were Black women who played professional baseball. Max is based on the only three women to ever play in the Negro League: Toni Stone, Mamie \u201cPeanut\u201d Johnson, and Connie Morgan. Stone (real name, Marcenia Lyle Alberga) became the first Black woman to play in the Negro League when she was signed by the Indianapolis Clowns in 1953. Lizzie Murphy, known as \u201cthe Queen of Baseball,\u201d was the first woman to ever play professional baseball alongside men. In 1922, she played first base for the Boston Red Sox during a charity exhibition game. No woman has ever been signed by MLB in its 146-year history, despite there being no rules against women playing for the league, which makes Stone\u2019s signing an impressive feat. She became her team\u2019s second baseman after they lost a talented infielder named Hank Aaron to the Boston (soon-to-be Milwaukee) Braves. Stone was considered to be the top female player in the 1940s and \u201850s due to her powerful swing. The career.243 hitter would later say the \u201chappiest moment\u201d of her life was getting a hit off legendary pitcher Satchel Paige, considered by many to be the greatest pitcher in Negro League history. Despite her success, Stone was not welcomed into the league by her fellow ballplayers. She had scars on her wrists from when male players tried to spike her with their cleats while sliding into second base. She told the San Francisco Chronicle in 1991 that her own teammates would tell her to \u201cgo home and fix my husband some biscuits.\u201d Stone only played two years in the Negro League, but her impressive play led to her induction into the Women\u2019s Sports Hall of Fame in 1993, three\n\nquestion: What time period is 'A League of Their Own' set in?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "World War II", "usage": 1092}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Johnson was the second female player and first female pitcher to join the Negro League after signing with the Indianapolis Clowns months after Stone joined the team. Over the course of Johnson\u2019s three-year career, she recorded 33 wins and eight losses. She also boasted a career batting average of.273. Johnson, who died in 2017, had gone to try out for the AAGPBL with a friend, but both women were turned down because they were Black. She later said that being rejected from the AAGPBL was one of the best things that ever happened to her. \u201cIf I would have played with the women, I would have missed out on the opportunity that I received, and I would have just been another player,\u201d she told the Kansas City Star in 2010. \u201cBut now, I\u2019ve done something that makes me stand out a little bit.\u201d It was Stone and Johnson who inspired Morgan to join the Negro League. After five seasons with the North Philadelphia Honey Drippers, an African American women\u2019s baseball team, she wrote Syd Pollock, the Clowns\u2019 general manager, asking for a tryout. He was so impressed by what he saw, he signed Morgan in 1954 to replace Stone (on Stone\u2019s recommendation) at second base. Morgan ended her one-year stint in the Negro League with a career batting average of.300. In 2010, Sports Illustrated went as far as to say that Morgan, who died in 1996, might have been the most talented female player to ever play in the Negro League. Read More: The Story Behind Netflix\u2019s Late-in-Life Coming-Out Documentary A Secret Love A League of Their Own has become an iconic queer movie despite having no openly gay characters. (Rosie O\u2019Donnell, who makes a cameo in the series, recently admitted that she has always believed her A League of Their Own character was gay, but Marshall disagreed.) The series looks to change that by putting the lives of queer people front and center. Players in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League were forced to hide their sexuality in plain sight. This was not only to keep their spots on the team, but so they could protect themselves and their families from the dangers that came with being gay. (Homosexuality was considered a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association up until 1973.) Yet Maybelle Blair, the former AAGPBL player who inspired Madonna\u2019s character in A League of Their Own, recently admitted that \u201cout of 650, I bet you 400 was gay.\u201d The now 95-year-old was one of them. \u201cI think  is a great opportunity for these young girl ball players to come  realize that they\u2019re not alone, and you don\u2019t have to hide,\u201d Blair said during a June panel at the 2022 Tribeca Festival. \u201cI hid for 75, 85 years and this is actually basically the first time I\u2019ve ever come out.\u201d The AAGPBL looked to erase lesbians from its history and there wasn\u2019t much the players could do to stop it back then. \u201cWe were born at a time when we were all in the closet and that was just the name of the game,\u201d Dot Wilkinson, one of the greatest softball players of all time, who is also gay, said in the 2015 documentary Extra Innings. \u201cAnd you had to live with it and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d Wikinson turned down the opportunity to play in the AAGPBL because she didn\u2019t want to adhere to the league\u2019s strict code of conduct, which forbade players from fraternizing with members of rival teams. One AAGPBL manager reportedly released two players whom he suspected were romantically involved, concerned that they would \u201ccontaminate\u201d their teammates, according to The Nation. Others like Terry Donahue, who played for the Peoria Redwings from 1946 through 1949, hid her seven-decade relationship with wife Pat Henschel from the world. Their love story was the subject of the 2020 Netflix documentary A Secret Love. The new series celebrates the league\u2019s queer history by bringing the lives of these ballplayers out of the shadows. The scene in which Carson discovers a hidden gay bar was inspired by Blair\u2019s own experiences on the road with her teammates, but ends much differently for the fictional character, who learns the hard way the dangers of being gay, even behind closed doors, in the \u201840s. The series says the \u201cthings that Penny Marshall couldn\u2019t say in 1992,\u201d Blair, who acted as a consultant for the show, told the Los Angeles Times in August. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t ready for any of this, but it needed to be told because it is the truth.\u201d Read More: Amazon\n\nquestion: What time period is 'A League of Their Own' set in?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1081}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

There they\u2019re taught how to walk \u201cgracefully and grandfully,\u201d sit like a lady, and sip tea without slurping, all of which is played for laughs. The show\u2019s charm school scene, however, gets at the real consequences that came with being told you weren\u2019t feminine enough to play baseball when one woman is sent home for not curtseying right and another nearly loses her spot for not applying her makeup correctly. The motto of the AAGPBL was \u201cplay like a man, look like a lady,\u201d and players were required to maintain a rigid beauty and personal hygiene routine to maintain their roster spots. Former players have said that the Helena Rubenstein-run charm school was the AAGPBL\u2019s way of weeding out the women they feared would be perceived as lesbians. Josephine \u201cJoJo\u201d D\u2019Angelo, who identified as gay, claimed she was kicked off her team for having a \u201cbutchy haircut.\u201d A former player named Connie Wisniewski was reportedly told \u201cshe\u2019d be kicked off her team if she chose to get a close-trimmed cut.\u201d No \u201cboyish bobs\u201d was just one of the AAGPBL\u2019s rules that was designed to help women \u201cdress, act, and carry themselves as befits the feminine sex,\u201d according to the league\u2019s official handbook. In the first episode of the series, after watching the tryouts, league owner and candymaker Morris Baker (a Wrigley surrogate played by Kevin Dunn) argues that they\u2019ll \u201cneed a magician\u201d to make these women appear more ladylike. \u201cLook at their calves,\u201d he gripes. \u201cThey\u2019re enormous!\u201d To which his right hand man Marshall (Nat Faxon) assures him he\u2019ll find someone to \u201cteach the women how to be women.\u201d In the real league, players were forced to wear lipstick on the field because \u201cevery woman wants to have an attractive and pleasing mouth.\u201d They were also required \u201cto preserve your nails in a presentable condition and in keeping with the practical needs of your hands in playing ball.\u201d Players faced fines of up to $10 if they wore pants or shorts outside of their living quarters. Three strikes and they would be thrown out of the league. One player was even told to stop wearing girls\u2019 Oxford shoes \u201cbecause they were excessively masculine-looking,\u201d according to Girls of Summer: In Their Own League. Most notably, the women were forced to play in skirts no shorter than six inches above the kneecap because Wrigley, the league\u2019s owner, thought it would be more pleasing to the eye. Despite it being far less safe for the players, who suffered horrible bruises nicknamed \u201cstrawberries\u201d from sliding. \u201cWhen I heard about the league\u2019s uniform, I thought that was a joke. No way was I gonna play ball in a dress,\u201d Joyce Hill Westerman, who played for the AAGPBL between 1944 and 1954, told the Chicago Tribune in 2014. \u201cBut then when I saw what kind of ball these ladies played, I was so in awe of them that I changed my mind.\u201d The new A League of Their Own focuses on the pressure women, especially queer women, were under to follow the league\u2019s patriarchal standards of beauty. What the show makes clear is that these women chose to play by the AAGPBL\u2019s rules because they knew it was the only way to make their dreams of playing professional baseball a reality.

She sees many former teammates and friends, prompting a flashback to 1943. When World War II threatens to shut down Major League Baseball, Chicago Cubs owner Walter Harvey persuades his fellow owners to bankroll a women's league. Ira Lowenstein is put in charge. Scout Ernie Capadino attends an industrial-league softball game in Oregon and likes what he sees in Dottie, the catcher for a local dairy. She is not interested; she is happy with her life while waiting for her husband Bob to return from the war. Her younger sister Kit Keller, however, is desperate to get away and make something of herself. Capadino is unimpressed by Kit's batting and refuses to watch her pitch, but agrees to take her along if she changes Dottie's mind. Dottie agrees for her sister's sake. Dottie and Kit travel to Harvey Field in Chicago for the tryout. They meet taxi dancer Mae \"All the Way Mae\" Mordabito and her best friend, bouncer Doris Murphy, soft-spoken right fielder Evelyn Gardner, illiterate left fielder Shirley Baker, pitcher/shortstop and former Miss Georgia beauty queen Ellen Sue Gotlander, left field/relief pitcher Betty \"Spaghetti\" Horn, second baseman Marla Hooch, first baseman Helen Haley, and Alice \"Skeeter\" Gaspers. They and five others constitute the Rockford Peaches, while 48 others make up the Racine Belles, Kenosha Comets, and South Bend Blue Sox. The Peaches are managed by former star Cubs slugger Jimmy Dugan, a cynical alcoholic. He initially treats the whole thing as a joke, forcing Dottie to take over as on-field leader initially. Dugan is also abrasive toward his players. The team travels with Evelyn's spoiled bratty son Stillwell and tightly wound team chaperone Miss Cuthburt. With a Life magazine photographer in the stands, Lowenstein begs the players to do something spectacular, as the league has attracted little attention. Dottie obliges, catching a popped-up ball behind home plate while doing a split. The resulting photograph makes the magazine cover. A publicity campaign draws more people to the ballgames, but the owners remain unconvinced. The teammates bond. Marla marries a man named Nelson whom she met on a raucous roadhouse outing and leaves the team for the rest of the season, Mae teaches Shirley to read, and Evelyn writes a team song. Lowenstein makes Dottie the face of the league, making Kit resentful. Their sibling rivalry intensifies, resulting in Kit's trade to the Racine Belles. The Peaches end the season with the league's best record, qualifying for the World Series. Jimmy gives Betty a telegram informing her that her husband was killed in action in the Pacific Theater. Grief-stricken, she leaves the team. That evening, Dottie receives a surprise when Bob shows up, having been wounded and discharged from the Army. Jimmy discovers that Dottie is going home with Bob. Unable to persuade her to play in the World Series, he tells her she will regret her decision. The Peaches face the Belles in the World Series, which goes the full seven games. Dottie rejoins the Peaches for the seventh game, while Kit is the starting pitcher for the Belles. With the Belles leading by a run in the top of the ninth, Dottie drives in the go-ahead run. Kit is distraught, but gets a second chance when she comes to bat with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. She gets a hit and, ignoring the third base coach's sign to stop, scores the winning run by knocking her sister over at the plate and dislodging the ball from Dottie's hand. The sellout crowd convinces Harvey to give Lowenstein the owners' support. After the game, the sisters reconcile before Dottie leaves with Bob.

The surviving Peaches sing Evelyn's team song and pose for a photo. During the closing credits, they play baseball at Doubleday Field. Director Penny Marshall was inspired by the 1987 TV documentary A League of their Own, about the AAGPBL. She had never heard of the league, and contacted the film's creators, Kelly Candaele and Kim Wilson, to collaborate with the scriptwriters, Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz, on producing a screenplay for 20th Century Fox. Fox eventually passed on the script and Marshall signed with Sony Pictures, who were eager to produce it. On MLB Network's Costas at the Movies in 2013, director Penny Marshall talked about her initial interest in Demi Moore for the part of Dottie Hinson: \"Demi Moore, I liked, but by the time we came around, she was pregnant.\" Debra Winger was then cast as Dottie and spent three months training with the Chicago Cubs in preparation. However, she dropped out of the production four weeks before the start of principal photography, later saying that the casting of Madonna was the reason for her decision. Marshall chose Geena Davis to replace Winger. USC assistant baseball coach Bill Hughes was the film's technical adviser and put the film's ensemble cast through baseball camp three months before filming. Principal photography began July 10, 1991. Filming the game scenes involved many physical mishaps: Anne Ramsay (Helen Haley) broke her nose with a baseball mitt while trying to catch a ball, and the large bruise seen on actress Ren\u00e9e Coleman's thigh was real. Discussing the skirts they wore playing in the film, Geena Davis said on MLB Network's Costas at the Movies in 2013, \"Some of our real cast, from sliding into home, had ripped the skin off their legs. It was nutty.\" In a 2021 interview, Petty claimed to have broken her foot during filming, but reiterated her enjoyment of the shoot and the understanding of the film's importance at the time. The tryout scene, at a fictional Major League Baseball stadium in Chicago called Harvey Field, was filmed at the Chicago Cubs' home stadium, Wrigley Field. The Rockford Peaches' home games were filmed at League Stadium in Huntingburg, Indiana, and the championship game against Racine was filmed at Bosse Field in Evansville, Indiana. Additional games were filmed at Jay Littleton Ball Park in Ontario, California. The house where the Rockford Peaches lived is in Henderson, Kentucky; in addition to interior shots, the exterior of the house is visible both when one of the team members weds and drives off with her husband and when Dottie is leaving with her husband. The final week of shooting was during late October 1991 in Cooperstown, New York, where 65 original AAGPBL members appeared in scenes recreating the induction of the league into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988. Due to the length of the schedule, the cast entertained themselves by putting on an elaborate amateur production, \"Jesus Christ Superstar Goes Hawaiian.\" A League of Their Own soundtrack was released on CD and cassette tape by Columbia Records on June 30, 1992. The album peaked at #159 on the US Billboard 200 albums chart on July 25, 1992. Although Madonna contributed \"This Used to Be My Playground\" to the film, featured over the closing credits, her recording was not included on the soundtrack album for contractual reasons. A League of Their Own was released on July 1, 1992, and grossed $13.2 million in its first weekend, finishing second at the box office behind Batman Returns. In its second weekend it dropped just 15%, making $11.5 million and finishing first. It ended up a commercial success, making $107.5 million in the United States and Canada, but only $24.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $132.4 million against a production budget of $40 million. The film was well received by critics, who praised the cast. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 81% based on 79 reviews, with an average score of 7/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Sentimental and light, but still thoroughly charming, A League of Their Own is buoyed by solid performances from a wonderful cast.\" On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 69 based 21 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote: \"Though big of budget, A League of Their Own is one of the year's most cheerful, most relaxed, most easily enjoyable comedies.

Jimmy Dugan's (Tom Hanks) remark to Evelyn Gardner (Bitty Schram), \"There's no crying in baseball!\", was ranked 54th on the American Film Institute's 2005 list AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. A League of Their Own was released as a 20th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray on October 16, 2012. 47 former AAGPBL players reunited in New York to celebrate the film and the real women who inspired it. Events included a trip to Cooperstown for a special program at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, reminiscent of the film's final scene depicting AAGPBL players and family meeting to honor the Women's Professional Baseball League. The reunion wrapped up with a game of softball held at Alliance Bank Stadium in nearby Syracuse. Former players also made an appearance at Bosse Field in Evansville, Indiana on June 6, 2012, where many of the film's game scenes were filmed. Bosse Field still retains many of the Racine Belles themes from the movie. The event included an outdoor screening of the film, and a display of cars featured in the film. In addition to Bosse Field, the production used Huntingburg, Indiana's League Stadium, another Southwestern Indiana field older than Bosse, that was renovated for it. A short-lived series of the same title based on the film aired on CBS in April 1993, with Garry Marshall, Megan Cavanagh, Tracy Reiner, Freddie Simpson, and Jon Lovitz reprising their roles. Carey Lowell took over Geena Davis's role. Only five of the six episodes made were broadcast. On August 6, 2020, Amazon Video ordered a reboot series with the same title as the movie. The series debuted on August 12, 2022, on Amazon. The series was renewed in March 2023 for a four-episode final season, but in August 2023, Amazon announced that the second season would be scrapped due to delays caused by the WGA strike.\n\nquestion: What does 'A League of Their Own' tell a fictionalized account of?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "A League of Their Own tells a fictionalized account of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during WWII.", "usage": 646}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The eight-episode TV show, now available to stream in full, offers a new spin on the beloved 1992 Penny Marshall film of the same name that tells the (mostly) true story of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) founded by Philip K. Wrigley, the gum magnate and Chicago Cubs owner, during World War II. The series isn\u2019t a remake of the beloved 30-year-old film starring Geena Davis, Madonna, and Rosie O\u2019Donnell, but a \u201creimagining,\u201d according to the show\u2019s co-creator and star Abbi Jacobson. \u201cWe are really attempting to tell the stories that were missing from the film, and about this league in particular,\u201d she told Entertainment Tonight earlier this month. The new A League of Their Own, like its predecessor, follows the Rockford Peaches over the course of the league\u2019s 1943 inaugural season. Yet the historical dramedy does so with a more inclusive purview and cast, focusing on two topics the film all but ignores: race and sexuality. The show stars Jacobson as Carson, the Peaches\u2019 starting catcher, whose acceptance into the league allows her a chance not just to play professional baseball but to broaden her sexual horizons. The series also tells the parallel story of Max, a talented pitcher, played by Chant\u00e9 Adams, who isn\u2019t allowed to try out for the AAGPBL because she is Black. The rejection puts her on a different path toward becoming a professional ball player and a journey toward redefining her gender identity. Both of these characters offer a modern take on the overlooked and misunderstood women of the AAGPBL, as well as a loving addendum to Marshall\u2019s film. Ultimately, A League of Their Own differs from the movie, but it stays true to history. Black women were denied the chance to try out for the AAGPBL because, like Major League Baseball in the early \u201840s, it was informally segregated. (The MLB\u2019s color barrier was broken in 1947 when Jackie Robinson signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers.) The original movie touches on this fact very briefly in a scene in which a Black woman (played by DeLisa Chinn-Tyler) sitting in the segregated area of the ballpark\u2019s stands throws a foul ball back to Rockford Peaches pitcher Ellen Sue (Freddie Simpson) with such force that it stings her hand. \u201cIt did bother us that in order to be historically accurate, we could not have a diverse cast,\u201d screenwriter Lowell Ganz told Buzzfeed in 2017. The less than 15-second scene was Ganz and his co-writer Babaloo Mandel\u2019s way of acknowledging the racial injustices of the AAGPBL, which did allow white-passing Latinas to play. Thirty years later, the Amazon series expands upon the memorable moment to show that despite being unable to play for the league, which ran for 12 seasons between 1943 and 1954, there were Black women who played professional baseball. Max is based on the only three women to ever play in the Negro League: Toni Stone, Mamie \u201cPeanut\u201d Johnson, and Connie Morgan. Stone (real name, Marcenia Lyle Alberga) became the first Black woman to play in the Negro League when she was signed by the Indianapolis Clowns in 1953. Lizzie Murphy, known as \u201cthe Queen of Baseball,\u201d was the first woman to ever play professional baseball alongside men. In 1922, she played first base for the Boston Red Sox during a charity exhibition game. No woman has ever been signed by MLB in its 146-year history, despite there being no rules against women playing for the league, which makes Stone\u2019s signing an impressive feat. She became her team\u2019s second baseman after they lost a talented infielder named Hank Aaron to the Boston (soon-to-be Milwaukee) Braves. Stone was considered to be the top female player in the 1940s and \u201850s due to her powerful swing. The career.243 hitter would later say the \u201chappiest moment\u201d of her life was getting a hit off legendary pitcher Satchel Paige, considered by many to be the greatest pitcher in Negro League history. Despite her success, Stone was not welcomed into the league by her fellow ballplayers. She had scars on her wrists from when male players tried to spike her with their cleats while sliding into second base. She told the San Francisco Chronicle in 1991 that her own teammates would tell her to \u201cgo home and fix my husband some biscuits.\u201d Stone only played two years in the Negro League, but her impressive play led to her induction into the Women\u2019s Sports Hall of Fame in 1993, three\n\nquestion: What does 'A League of Their Own' tell a fictionalized account of?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) during World War II", "usage": 1108}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Johnson was the second female player and first female pitcher to join the Negro League after signing with the Indianapolis Clowns months after Stone joined the team. Over the course of Johnson\u2019s three-year career, she recorded 33 wins and eight losses. She also boasted a career batting average of.273. Johnson, who died in 2017, had gone to try out for the AAGPBL with a friend, but both women were turned down because they were Black. She later said that being rejected from the AAGPBL was one of the best things that ever happened to her. \u201cIf I would have played with the women, I would have missed out on the opportunity that I received, and I would have just been another player,\u201d she told the Kansas City Star in 2010. \u201cBut now, I\u2019ve done something that makes me stand out a little bit.\u201d It was Stone and Johnson who inspired Morgan to join the Negro League. After five seasons with the North Philadelphia Honey Drippers, an African American women\u2019s baseball team, she wrote Syd Pollock, the Clowns\u2019 general manager, asking for a tryout. He was so impressed by what he saw, he signed Morgan in 1954 to replace Stone (on Stone\u2019s recommendation) at second base. Morgan ended her one-year stint in the Negro League with a career batting average of.300. In 2010, Sports Illustrated went as far as to say that Morgan, who died in 1996, might have been the most talented female player to ever play in the Negro League. Read More: The Story Behind Netflix\u2019s Late-in-Life Coming-Out Documentary A Secret Love A League of Their Own has become an iconic queer movie despite having no openly gay characters. (Rosie O\u2019Donnell, who makes a cameo in the series, recently admitted that she has always believed her A League of Their Own character was gay, but Marshall disagreed.) The series looks to change that by putting the lives of queer people front and center. Players in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League were forced to hide their sexuality in plain sight. This was not only to keep their spots on the team, but so they could protect themselves and their families from the dangers that came with being gay. (Homosexuality was considered a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association up until 1973.) Yet Maybelle Blair, the former AAGPBL player who inspired Madonna\u2019s character in A League of Their Own, recently admitted that \u201cout of 650, I bet you 400 was gay.\u201d The now 95-year-old was one of them. \u201cI think  is a great opportunity for these young girl ball players to come  realize that they\u2019re not alone, and you don\u2019t have to hide,\u201d Blair said during a June panel at the 2022 Tribeca Festival. \u201cI hid for 75, 85 years and this is actually basically the first time I\u2019ve ever come out.\u201d The AAGPBL looked to erase lesbians from its history and there wasn\u2019t much the players could do to stop it back then. \u201cWe were born at a time when we were all in the closet and that was just the name of the game,\u201d Dot Wilkinson, one of the greatest softball players of all time, who is also gay, said in the 2015 documentary Extra Innings. \u201cAnd you had to live with it and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d Wikinson turned down the opportunity to play in the AAGPBL because she didn\u2019t want to adhere to the league\u2019s strict code of conduct, which forbade players from fraternizing with members of rival teams. One AAGPBL manager reportedly released two players whom he suspected were romantically involved, concerned that they would \u201ccontaminate\u201d their teammates, according to The Nation. Others like Terry Donahue, who played for the Peoria Redwings from 1946 through 1949, hid her seven-decade relationship with wife Pat Henschel from the world. Their love story was the subject of the 2020 Netflix documentary A Secret Love. The new series celebrates the league\u2019s queer history by bringing the lives of these ballplayers out of the shadows. The scene in which Carson discovers a hidden gay bar was inspired by Blair\u2019s own experiences on the road with her teammates, but ends much differently for the fictional character, who learns the hard way the dangers of being gay, even behind closed doors, in the \u201840s. The series says the \u201cthings that Penny Marshall couldn\u2019t say in 1992,\u201d Blair, who acted as a consultant for the show, told the Los Angeles Times in August. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t ready for any of this, but it needed to be told because it is the truth.\u201d Read More: Amazon\n\nquestion: What does 'A League of Their Own' tell a fictionalized account of?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1083}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

There they\u2019re taught how to walk \u201cgracefully and grandfully,\u201d sit like a lady, and sip tea without slurping, all of which is played for laughs. The show\u2019s charm school scene, however, gets at the real consequences that came with being told you weren\u2019t feminine enough to play baseball when one woman is sent home for not curtseying right and another nearly loses her spot for not applying her makeup correctly. The motto of the AAGPBL was \u201cplay like a man, look like a lady,\u201d and players were required to maintain a rigid beauty and personal hygiene routine to maintain their roster spots. Former players have said that the Helena Rubenstein-run charm school was the AAGPBL\u2019s way of weeding out the women they feared would be perceived as lesbians. Josephine \u201cJoJo\u201d D\u2019Angelo, who identified as gay, claimed she was kicked off her team for having a \u201cbutchy haircut.\u201d A former player named Connie Wisniewski was reportedly told \u201cshe\u2019d be kicked off her team if she chose to get a close-trimmed cut.\u201d No \u201cboyish bobs\u201d was just one of the AAGPBL\u2019s rules that was designed to help women \u201cdress, act, and carry themselves as befits the feminine sex,\u201d according to the league\u2019s official handbook. In the first episode of the series, after watching the tryouts, league owner and candymaker Morris Baker (a Wrigley surrogate played by Kevin Dunn) argues that they\u2019ll \u201cneed a magician\u201d to make these women appear more ladylike. \u201cLook at their calves,\u201d he gripes. \u201cThey\u2019re enormous!\u201d To which his right hand man Marshall (Nat Faxon) assures him he\u2019ll find someone to \u201cteach the women how to be women.\u201d In the real league, players were forced to wear lipstick on the field because \u201cevery woman wants to have an attractive and pleasing mouth.\u201d They were also required \u201cto preserve your nails in a presentable condition and in keeping with the practical needs of your hands in playing ball.\u201d Players faced fines of up to $10 if they wore pants or shorts outside of their living quarters. Three strikes and they would be thrown out of the league. One player was even told to stop wearing girls\u2019 Oxford shoes \u201cbecause they were excessively masculine-looking,\u201d according to Girls of Summer: In Their Own League. Most notably, the women were forced to play in skirts no shorter than six inches above the kneecap because Wrigley, the league\u2019s owner, thought it would be more pleasing to the eye. Despite it being far less safe for the players, who suffered horrible bruises nicknamed \u201cstrawberries\u201d from sliding. \u201cWhen I heard about the league\u2019s uniform, I thought that was a joke. No way was I gonna play ball in a dress,\u201d Joyce Hill Westerman, who played for the AAGPBL between 1944 and 1954, told the Chicago Tribune in 2014. \u201cBut then when I saw what kind of ball these ladies played, I was so in awe of them that I changed my mind.\u201d The new A League of Their Own focuses on the pressure women, especially queer women, were under to follow the league\u2019s patriarchal standards of beauty. What the show makes clear is that these women chose to play by the AAGPBL\u2019s rules because they knew it was the only way to make their dreams of playing professional baseball a reality.
