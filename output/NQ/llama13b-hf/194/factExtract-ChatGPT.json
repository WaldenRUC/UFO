This can cause the clock to display the wrong time if the user is in a different time zone. Daylight Saving Time: Many countries observe daylight saving time, which can cause the clock on the wall to display the wrong time if the user is not aware of the correct time. Battery Life: If the clock on the wall is battery-powered, the battery life can affect the accuracy of the clock. A weak battery can cause the clock to display the wrong time or stop working altogether. Maintenance: The clock on the wall requires regular maintenance to ensure accurate timekeeping. Dust, dirt, and other debris can accumulate on the clock's mechanisms, causing it to display the wrong time.", "phrase": "Time zone, Daylight Saving Time, Battery Life, Maintenance"}, {"question": "When is it safe to rely on the time displayed on the clock?", "sentence": "When is it Safe to Rely on the Time Displayed on the Clock? When the clock is set to the correct time zone and daylight saving time is observed. When the battery is new and has a full charge. When the clock has been regularly maintained and cleaned.", "phrase": "When it is set to the correct time zone and observes daylight saving time, when the battery is new and fully charged, when it has been regularly maintained and cleaned"}]}
