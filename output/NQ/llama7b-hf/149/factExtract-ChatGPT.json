These three molecules are produced through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA, a molecule that is produced from the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.", "phrase": "ATP, NADH, and FADH2"}, {"question": "How is ATP produced during the citric acid cycle?", "sentence": "ATP is the primary energy-carrying molecule in the cell, and it is produced through the process of substrate-level phosphorylation. During the citric acid cycle, ATP is produced through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA, which is the primary source of energy for the cell.", "phrase": "Through the process of substrate-level phosphorylation"}, {"question": "What is NADH and how is it produced during the citric acid cycle?", "sentence": "NADH is another important energy-carrying molecule that is produced during the citric acid cycle. NADH is produced through the reduction of coenzyme NAD+, which is a critical component of the citric acid cycle.", "phrase": "NADH is an important energy-carrying molecule that is produced through the reduction of coenzyme NAD+"}, {"question": "What is FADH2 and how is it produced during the citric acid cycle?", "sentence": "FADH2 is the third end product of the citric acid cycle, and it is produced through the oxidation of fatty acids and other substrates.", "phrase": "FADH2 is the third end product of the citric acid cycle and is produced through the oxidation of fatty acids and other substrates"}]}
