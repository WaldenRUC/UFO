Directly answer yes or no.\nAnswer 1: The ratio of the length of the second finger (2D:4D) to the length of the fourth finger (2D:4D) may be related to exposure to certain hormones in the womb, which can affect brain development.\nAnswer 2: The 2D:4D ratio is the ratio of the lengths of the index finger and the ring finger in males. It is related to schizophrenia as a lower 2D:4D asymmetry index was found in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy individuals.": {"response": "No", "usage": 139}, "Your task is to judge whether the following two answers are factually consistent.
