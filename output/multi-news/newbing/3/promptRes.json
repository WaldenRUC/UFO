A source close to the matter told the Journal that the company is closing its doors because it lost several clients in recent months and faces growing legal fees as part of the Facebook investigation. Cambridge Analytica has been at the heart of the data scandal that has rocked Facebook, the world's largest social network, and led to calls for more regulation of user data. Facebook banned the political data analysis firm in March, and said it believes data from up to 87 million people was \"improperly shared\" with Cambridge Analytica. \"Facebook's trying to move past this all, and this is kind of the next step in that,\" Ian Sherr, the executive editor of CNET News, said about Cambridge Analytica's closure. \"This company is no longer going to be a thorn in their side in the real world. It's now a rhetorical thorn in their side that people will bring up quite often whenever concerned about privacy.\" The man who mined who data for Cambridge Analytica is a scientist named Aleksandr Kogan. He developed an app that harvested data from tens of millions of unwitting Facebook users, CBS News' Lesley Stahl reported last month for \"60 Minutes.\" He asked Facebook users to take a survey and used their answers to build psychological profiles meant to predict their behavior. When doing that, he failed to disclose that what he was really after was access to their friends -- tens of millions of people he could not otherwise reach easily. He also didn't disclose that he was doing the survey for Cambridge Analytica, which used the material to influence people on behalf of political clients. Kogan acknowledged giving the data to Cambridge Analytica and apologized for his actions in the \"60 Minutes\" interview. He said he was \"sincerely sorry\" about the way he and \"tens of thousands\" of other app developers took advantage of what he said was Facebook's lax data policy enforcement, but he doesn't think he really did anything wrong. As political consultants, Cambridge Analytica was hired by campaigns to analyze voters and target them with ads. In the 2016 presidential election, it worked first for Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign, then later for Donald Trump, though his campaign says they didn't use the Kogan data. The Republican benefactors Robert and Rebekah Mercer were Cambridge Analytica's financial backers, and Steve Bannon was on the board. Cambridge Analytica suspended chief executive Alexander Nix in March after he and other senior executives at the firm were caught on video saying they would go beyond using data to hurt a client's rival political candidate. Those tactics, Nix said in a report broadcast by the U.K.'s Channel 4, included entrapping politicians to influence an election's outcome. Late last month, Kogan took questions from British lawmakers. First published on May 2, 2018 / 2:59 PM EDT \u00a9 2018 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The company will begin bankruptcy proceedings, it said, after losing clients and facing mounting legal fees resulting from the scandal over reports the company harvested personal data about millions of Facebook users beginning in 2014. \u201cThe siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.\u201d Allegations of the improper use of data for 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 U.S. election campaign, has hurt the shares of the world\u2019s biggest social network and prompted multiple official investigations in the United States and Europe. Related Coverage \u201cOver the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company\u2019s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said. The firm is shutting down effective Wednesday and employees have been told to turn in their computers, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier. The Cambridge Analytica sign had been removed from the reception area of its London offices on Wednesday. At SCL\u2019s Washington, D.C. office, a man declined to answer questions from a Reuters reporter. After the announcement, Britain\u2019s data regulator said it would continue civil and criminal investigations of the firm and will pursue \u201cindividuals and directors as appropriate\u201d despite the shutdown. \u201cWe will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said in a statement. Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported. Cambridge Analytica marketed itself as a provider of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients. After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm\u2019s help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a \u201csecret sauce\u201d it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could. One unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia is whether Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time messages during the campaign that were anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive. Bannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm, and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation.

Issie Lapowsky Cambridge Analytica, the embattled data firm that worked on President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, has told employees it is shutting down, along with its UK counterpart SCL Elections. The move, which impacts all offices of both companies worldwide, comes amid recent revelations that the company harvested the data of up to 87 million Facebook users without their consent, according to multiple sources close to the company. The decision to close the company's doors internationally was announced to employees during a global town hall meeting, held in the firm's New York City offices Wednesday. The company's reportedly recently appointed CEO Julian Wheatland told staffers the company had evaluated all options and no longer saw a way forward. One source says that New York employees were told to pack up and leave immediately, with few details about how they'll be compensated going forward. The feeling in the room was \"just shock,\" says the source. \u201cThere was indication the company was in trouble and change would be coming, but we didn\u2019t see this as the resolution.\" SCL Elections and \"certain of its affiliates,\" including Cambridge Analytica, are beginning insolvency proceedings in the UK and filing for bankruptcy in the United States, according to a statement from the data firm's US-based branch. \"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers,\" the statement read. \"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration.\" Gizmodo first reported that Cambridge Analytica's US offices would shut down. According to a source, the decision also impacts SCL Defense, which has done work for the US government. The Wall Street Journal reports that SCL Group founder Nigel Oakes confirmed both SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica are closing. In March, The New York Times, alongside The Guardian and The Observer, published simultaneous accounts from a former whistleblower named Christopher Wylie, who reported that Cambridge Analytica had hired a researcher to conduct a psychological profile of the American electorate. The researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, built a personality quiz app that collected data on anyone who took it, as well as on their friends. Kogan sold that data to Cambridge Analytica to develop so-called \"psychographic profiles\" of American voters. Hours before the news broke, Facebook cut Cambridge Analytica and SCL off from its platform, deeply wounding a company that had already lost market share in both its political and commercial business. Shortly after, Channel 4 news in the UK aired undercover videos in which the former CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, was recorded bragging about using underhanded tactics like bribery and entrapment on behalf of his clients. In the statement put out by Cambridge Analytica, the company noted the results of an internal investigation which concluded that the allegations against it were not \"borne out by the facts.\u201d Angela Watercutter Steven Levy Steven Levy Andy Greenberg Nix was removed as CEO in March, but the company vowed to press on. Just yesterday, Cambridge Analytica's official Twitter account tweeted out a link to a website refuting the waves of bad press the company has received with the caption, \"Get the Facts Behind the Facebook Story.\" In March, Business Insider reported that several of Cambridge Analytica's key players had set up a separate company called Emerdata in the UK last year. Cambridge Analytica's main funder Rebekah Mercer sits on that company's board. Cambridge Analytica and SCL continue to be the subject of an investigation by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office into the role both companies played in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Updated: 4:02 pm ET 5/2/2018 This story was updated throughout to include comments from Cambridge Analytica and its employees, additional details about Emerdata, and confirmation by SCL Group's founder that the companies are shutting down.

The British-based company and its affiliate, SCL Elections, are filing insolvency proceedings in Britain and bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. Cambridge Analytica said a \u201csiege of media coverage\u201d of its dealings with Facebook has driven away customers, leaving the business no longer viable. It said reports about how it obtained and used Facebook user data were unfounded. \u201cDespite the company\u2019s efforts to correct the record,  has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\u201d the company said in a statement. Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research used the quiz app \u201cThis Is Your Digital Life\u201d to gather data on 270,000 users \u2014 and the users\u2019 friends, who did not participate in the quiz \u2014 which it then shared with Cambridge Analytica in 2015. The company used the demographic information from 87 million Facebook users to target political advertising. In March, whistleblower and Cambridge Analytica co-founder Christopher Wylie revealed the company was holding onto user data without their consent even after Facebook told the company to delete it. Wylie said the company was initially funded by billionaire Robert Mercer and his boss was former Breitbart founder and White House adviser Steve Bannon. Wylie said leadership at Cambridge Analytica wanted to fight a \u201cculture war.\u201d \u201cRules don\u2019t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it\u2019s all fair,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to fight a culture war in America.\u201d \u201cCambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\u201d Wylie said he used coding to execute Bannon and Mercer\u2019s idea to combine big data and social media to target Facebook users based on psychological profiles. On March 20, Cambridge Analytica suspended CEO Alexander Nix and said it was investigating comments Nix made in an undercover recording. He said the company could secretly compromise political rivals by arranging smear campaigns, setting up encounters with prostitutes and staging bribery situations. Counsel Julian Malins, who conducted Cambridge Analytica\u2019s internal investigation, said allegations against the firm were not \u201cborne out by the facts.\u201d \u201cI had full access to all members of staff and documents in the preparation of my report,\u201d Malins said. \u201cMy findings entirely reflect the amazement of the staff, on watching the television programmes and reading the sensationalistic reporting, that any of these media outlets could have been talking about the company for which they worked. Nothing of what they heard or read resonated with what they actually did for a living.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign used the services of Cambridge Analytica for the 2016 presidential election.

The United Kingdom-based company that collaborated with Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign made the decision to close its doors after many of its largest clients walked out \u2014 a result of accusations that it used leaked personal data to inform political campaigns. The firm violated Facebook\u2019s policy in order to obtain knowledge from user accounts. Cambridge Analytica released a statement Wednesday on its closure, and said it was \u201cvilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\u201d Its parent company, SCL, will also shut down. In early April, Cambridge Analytica denied having access to 87 million accounts in another statement. \u201cCambridge Analytica licensed data for no more than 30 million people,\u201d the company said, in addition to reiterating that none of the information obtained informed the 2016 presidential campaign. During a Congressional hearing on April 11, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made his most recent of multiple apologies for the incident, stressing his dedication to consumer privacy. \u201cIt\u2019s clear now that we didn\u2019t do enough to prevent  tools from being used for harm,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cIt was my mistake, and I\u2019m sorry.

A source close to the matter told the Journal that the company is closing its doors because it lost several clients in recent months and faces growing legal fees as part of the Facebook investigation. Cambridge Analytica has been at the heart of the data scandal that has rocked Facebook, the world's largest social network, and led to calls for more regulation of user data. Facebook banned the political data analysis firm in March, and said it believes data from up to 87 million people was \"improperly shared\" with Cambridge Analytica. \"Facebook's trying to move past this all, and this is kind of the next step in that,\" Ian Sherr, the executive editor of CNET News, said about Cambridge Analytica's closure. \"This company is no longer going to be a thorn in their side in the real world. It's now a rhetorical thorn in their side that people will bring up quite often whenever concerned about privacy.\" The man who mined who data for Cambridge Analytica is a scientist named Aleksandr Kogan. He developed an app that harvested data from tens of millions of unwitting Facebook users, CBS News' Lesley Stahl reported last month for \"60 Minutes.\" He asked Facebook users to take a survey and used their answers to build psychological profiles meant to predict their behavior. When doing that, he failed to disclose that what he was really after was access to their friends -- tens of millions of people he could not otherwise reach easily. He also didn't disclose that he was doing the survey for Cambridge Analytica, which used the material to influence people on behalf of political clients. Kogan acknowledged giving the data to Cambridge Analytica and apologized for his actions in the \"60 Minutes\" interview. He said he was \"sincerely sorry\" about the way he and \"tens of thousands\" of other app developers took advantage of what he said was Facebook's lax data policy enforcement, but he doesn't think he really did anything wrong. As political consultants, Cambridge Analytica was hired by campaigns to analyze voters and target them with ads. In the 2016 presidential election, it worked first for Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign, then later for Donald Trump, though his campaign says they didn't use the Kogan data. The Republican benefactors Robert and Rebekah Mercer were Cambridge Analytica's financial backers, and Steve Bannon was on the board. Cambridge Analytica suspended chief executive Alexander Nix in March after he and other senior executives at the firm were caught on video saying they would go beyond using data to hurt a client's rival political candidate. Those tactics, Nix said in a report broadcast by the U.K.'s Channel 4, included entrapping politicians to influence an election's outcome. Late last month, Kogan took questions from British lawmakers. First published on May 2, 2018 / 2:59 PM EDT \u00a9 2018 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The company will begin bankruptcy proceedings, it said, after losing clients and facing mounting legal fees resulting from the scandal over reports the company harvested personal data about millions of Facebook users beginning in 2014. \u201cThe siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.\u201d Allegations of the improper use of data for 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 U.S. election campaign, has hurt the shares of the world\u2019s biggest social network and prompted multiple official investigations in the United States and Europe. Related Coverage \u201cOver the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company\u2019s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said. The firm is shutting down effective Wednesday and employees have been told to turn in their computers, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier. The Cambridge Analytica sign had been removed from the reception area of its London offices on Wednesday. At SCL\u2019s Washington, D.C. office, a man declined to answer questions from a Reuters reporter. After the announcement, Britain\u2019s data regulator said it would continue civil and criminal investigations of the firm and will pursue \u201cindividuals and directors as appropriate\u201d despite the shutdown. \u201cWe will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said in a statement. Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported. Cambridge Analytica marketed itself as a provider of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients. After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm\u2019s help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a \u201csecret sauce\u201d it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could. One unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia is whether Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time messages during the campaign that were anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive. Bannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm, and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation.

Issie Lapowsky Cambridge Analytica, the embattled data firm that worked on President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, has told employees it is shutting down, along with its UK counterpart SCL Elections. The move, which impacts all offices of both companies worldwide, comes amid recent revelations that the company harvested the data of up to 87 million Facebook users without their consent, according to multiple sources close to the company. The decision to close the company's doors internationally was announced to employees during a global town hall meeting, held in the firm's New York City offices Wednesday. The company's reportedly recently appointed CEO Julian Wheatland told staffers the company had evaluated all options and no longer saw a way forward. One source says that New York employees were told to pack up and leave immediately, with few details about how they'll be compensated going forward. The feeling in the room was \"just shock,\" says the source. \u201cThere was indication the company was in trouble and change would be coming, but we didn\u2019t see this as the resolution.\" SCL Elections and \"certain of its affiliates,\" including Cambridge Analytica, are beginning insolvency proceedings in the UK and filing for bankruptcy in the United States, according to a statement from the data firm's US-based branch. \"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers,\" the statement read. \"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration.\" Gizmodo first reported that Cambridge Analytica's US offices would shut down. According to a source, the decision also impacts SCL Defense, which has done work for the US government. The Wall Street Journal reports that SCL Group founder Nigel Oakes confirmed both SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica are closing. In March, The New York Times, alongside The Guardian and The Observer, published simultaneous accounts from a former whistleblower named Christopher Wylie, who reported that Cambridge Analytica had hired a researcher to conduct a psychological profile of the American electorate. The researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, built a personality quiz app that collected data on anyone who took it, as well as on their friends. Kogan sold that data to Cambridge Analytica to develop so-called \"psychographic profiles\" of American voters. Hours before the news broke, Facebook cut Cambridge Analytica and SCL off from its platform, deeply wounding a company that had already lost market share in both its political and commercial business. Shortly after, Channel 4 news in the UK aired undercover videos in which the former CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, was recorded bragging about using underhanded tactics like bribery and entrapment on behalf of his clients. In the statement put out by Cambridge Analytica, the company noted the results of an internal investigation which concluded that the allegations against it were not \"borne out by the facts.\u201d Angela Watercutter Steven Levy Steven Levy Andy Greenberg Nix was removed as CEO in March, but the company vowed to press on. Just yesterday, Cambridge Analytica's official Twitter account tweeted out a link to a website refuting the waves of bad press the company has received with the caption, \"Get the Facts Behind the Facebook Story.\" In March, Business Insider reported that several of Cambridge Analytica's key players had set up a separate company called Emerdata in the UK last year. Cambridge Analytica's main funder Rebekah Mercer sits on that company's board. Cambridge Analytica and SCL continue to be the subject of an investigation by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office into the role both companies played in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Updated: 4:02 pm ET 5/2/2018 This story was updated throughout to include comments from Cambridge Analytica and its employees, additional details about Emerdata, and confirmation by SCL Group's founder that the companies are shutting down.

The British-based company and its affiliate, SCL Elections, are filing insolvency proceedings in Britain and bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. Cambridge Analytica said a \u201csiege of media coverage\u201d of its dealings with Facebook has driven away customers, leaving the business no longer viable. It said reports about how it obtained and used Facebook user data were unfounded. \u201cDespite the company\u2019s efforts to correct the record,  has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\u201d the company said in a statement. Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research used the quiz app \u201cThis Is Your Digital Life\u201d to gather data on 270,000 users \u2014 and the users\u2019 friends, who did not participate in the quiz \u2014 which it then shared with Cambridge Analytica in 2015. The company used the demographic information from 87 million Facebook users to target political advertising. In March, whistleblower and Cambridge Analytica co-founder Christopher Wylie revealed the company was holding onto user data without their consent even after Facebook told the company to delete it. Wylie said the company was initially funded by billionaire Robert Mercer and his boss was former Breitbart founder and White House adviser Steve Bannon. Wylie said leadership at Cambridge Analytica wanted to fight a \u201cculture war.\u201d \u201cRules don\u2019t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it\u2019s all fair,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to fight a culture war in America.\u201d \u201cCambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\u201d Wylie said he used coding to execute Bannon and Mercer\u2019s idea to combine big data and social media to target Facebook users based on psychological profiles. On March 20, Cambridge Analytica suspended CEO Alexander Nix and said it was investigating comments Nix made in an undercover recording. He said the company could secretly compromise political rivals by arranging smear campaigns, setting up encounters with prostitutes and staging bribery situations. Counsel Julian Malins, who conducted Cambridge Analytica\u2019s internal investigation, said allegations against the firm were not \u201cborne out by the facts.\u201d \u201cI had full access to all members of staff and documents in the preparation of my report,\u201d Malins said. \u201cMy findings entirely reflect the amazement of the staff, on watching the television programmes and reading the sensationalistic reporting, that any of these media outlets could have been talking about the company for which they worked. Nothing of what they heard or read resonated with what they actually did for a living.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign used the services of Cambridge Analytica for the 2016 presidential election.

Cambridge Analytica and SCL continue to be the subject of an investigation by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office into the role both companies played in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Updated: 4:02 pm ET 5/2/2018 This story was updated throughout to include comments from Cambridge Analytica and its employees, additional details about Emerdata, and confirmation by SCL Group's founder that the companies are shutting down.

The British-based company and its affiliate, SCL Elections, are filing insolvency proceedings in Britain and bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. Cambridge Analytica said a \u201csiege of media coverage\u201d of its dealings with Facebook has driven away customers, leaving the business no longer viable. It said reports about how it obtained and used Facebook user data were unfounded. \u201cDespite the company\u2019s efforts to correct the record,  has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\u201d the company said in a statement. Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research used the quiz app \u201cThis Is Your Digital Life\u201d to gather data on 270,000 users \u2014 and the users\u2019 friends, who did not participate in the quiz \u2014 which it then shared with Cambridge Analytica in 2015. The company used the demographic information from 87 million Facebook users to target political advertising. In March, whistleblower and Cambridge Analytica co-founder Christopher Wylie revealed the company was holding onto user data without their consent even after Facebook told the company to delete it. Wylie said the company was initially funded by billionaire Robert Mercer and his boss was former Breitbart founder and White House adviser Steve Bannon. Wylie said leadership at Cambridge Analytica wanted to fight a \u201cculture war.\u201d \u201cRules don\u2019t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it\u2019s all fair,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to fight a culture war in America.\u201d \u201cCambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\u201d Wylie said he used coding to execute Bannon and Mercer\u2019s idea to combine big data and social media to target Facebook users based on psychological profiles. On March 20, Cambridge Analytica suspended CEO Alexander Nix and said it was investigating comments Nix made in an undercover recording. He said the company could secretly compromise political rivals by arranging smear campaigns, setting up encounters with prostitutes and staging bribery situations. Counsel Julian Malins, who conducted Cambridge Analytica\u2019s internal investigation, said allegations against the firm were not \u201cborne out by the facts.\u201d \u201cI had full access to all members of staff and documents in the preparation of my report,\u201d Malins said. \u201cMy findings entirely reflect the amazement of the staff, on watching the television programmes and reading the sensationalistic reporting, that any of these media outlets could have been talking about the company for which they worked. Nothing of what they heard or read resonated with what they actually did for a living.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign used the services of Cambridge Analytica for the 2016 presidential election.

A source close to the matter told the Journal that the company is closing its doors because it lost several clients in recent months and faces growing legal fees as part of the Facebook investigation. Cambridge Analytica has been at the heart of the data scandal that has rocked Facebook, the world's largest social network, and led to calls for more regulation of user data. Facebook banned the political data analysis firm in March, and said it believes data from up to 87 million people was \"improperly shared\" with Cambridge Analytica. \"Facebook's trying to move past this all, and this is kind of the next step in that,\" Ian Sherr, the executive editor of CNET News, said about Cambridge Analytica's closure. \"This company is no longer going to be a thorn in their side in the real world. It's now a rhetorical thorn in their side that people will bring up quite often whenever concerned about privacy.\" The man who mined who data for Cambridge Analytica is a scientist named Aleksandr Kogan. He developed an app that harvested data from tens of millions of unwitting Facebook users, CBS News' Lesley Stahl reported last month for \"60 Minutes.\" He asked Facebook users to take a survey and used their answers to build psychological profiles meant to predict their behavior. When doing that, he failed to disclose that what he was really after was access to their friends -- tens of millions of people he could not otherwise reach easily. He also didn't disclose that he was doing the survey for Cambridge Analytica, which used the material to influence people on behalf of political clients. Kogan acknowledged giving the data to Cambridge Analytica and apologized for his actions in the \"60 Minutes\" interview. He said he was \"sincerely sorry\" about the way he and \"tens of thousands\" of other app developers took advantage of what he said was Facebook's lax data policy enforcement, but he doesn't think he really did anything wrong. As political consultants, Cambridge Analytica was hired by campaigns to analyze voters and target them with ads. In the 2016 presidential election, it worked first for Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign, then later for Donald Trump, though his campaign says they didn't use the Kogan data. The Republican benefactors Robert and Rebekah Mercer were Cambridge Analytica's financial backers, and Steve Bannon was on the board. Cambridge Analytica suspended chief executive Alexander Nix in March after he and other senior executives at the firm were caught on video saying they would go beyond using data to hurt a client's rival political candidate. Those tactics, Nix said in a report broadcast by the U.K.'s Channel 4, included entrapping politicians to influence an election's outcome. Late last month, Kogan took questions from British lawmakers. First published on May 2, 2018 / 2:59 PM EDT \u00a9 2018 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The company will begin bankruptcy proceedings, it said, after losing clients and facing mounting legal fees resulting from the scandal over reports the company harvested personal data about millions of Facebook users beginning in 2014. \u201cThe siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.\u201d Allegations of the improper use of data for 87 million Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 U.S. election campaign, has hurt the shares of the world\u2019s biggest social network and prompted multiple official investigations in the United States and Europe. Related Coverage \u201cOver the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company\u2019s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said. The firm is shutting down effective Wednesday and employees have been told to turn in their computers, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier. The Cambridge Analytica sign had been removed from the reception area of its London offices on Wednesday. At SCL\u2019s Washington, D.C. office, a man declined to answer questions from a Reuters reporter. After the announcement, Britain\u2019s data regulator said it would continue civil and criminal investigations of the firm and will pursue \u201cindividuals and directors as appropriate\u201d despite the shutdown. \u201cWe will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said in a statement. Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on U.S. elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, the New York Times reported. Cambridge Analytica marketed itself as a provider of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients. After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm\u2019s help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a \u201csecret sauce\u201d it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could. One unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia is whether Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time messages during the campaign that were anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive. Bannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm, and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation.

To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Issie Lapowsky Cambridge Analytica, the embattled data firm that worked on President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, has told employees it is shutting down, along with its UK counterpart SCL Elections. The move, which impacts all offices of both companies worldwide, comes amid recent revelations that the company harvested the data of up to 87 million Facebook users without their consent, according to multiple sources close to the company. The decision to close the company's doors internationally was announced to employees during a global town hall meeting, held in the firm's New York City offices Wednesday. The company's reportedly recently appointed CEO Julian Wheatland told staffers the company had evaluated all options and no longer saw a way forward. One source says that New York employees were told to pack up and leave immediately, with few details about how they'll be compensated going forward. The feeling in the room was \"just shock,\" says the source. \u201cThere was indication the company was in trouble and change would be coming, but we didn\u2019t see this as the resolution.\" SCL Elections and \"certain of its affiliates,\" including Cambridge Analytica, are beginning insolvency proceedings in the UK and filing for bankruptcy in the United States, according to a statement from the data firm's US-based branch. \"The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers,\" the statement read. \"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration.\" Gizmodo first reported that Cambridge Analytica's US offices would shut down. According to a source, the decision also impacts SCL Defense, which has done work for the US government. The Wall Street Journal reports that SCL Group founder Nigel Oakes confirmed both SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica are closing. In March, The New York Times, alongside The Guardian and The Observer, published simultaneous accounts from a former whistleblower named Christopher Wylie, who reported that Cambridge Analytica had hired a researcher to conduct a psychological profile of the American electorate. The researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, built a personality quiz app that collected data on anyone who took it, as well as on their friends. Kogan sold that data to Cambridge Analytica to develop so-called \"psychographic profiles\" of American voters. Hours before the news broke, Facebook cut Cambridge Analytica and SCL off from its platform, deeply wounding a company that had already lost market share in both its political and commercial business. Shortly after, Channel 4 news in the UK aired undercover videos in which the former CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, was recorded bragging about using underhanded tactics like bribery and entrapment on behalf of his clients. In the statement put out by Cambridge Analytica, the company noted the results of an internal investigation which concluded that the allegations against it were not \"borne out by the facts.\u201d Angela Watercutter Steven Levy Steven Levy Andy Greenberg Nix was removed as CEO in March, but the company vowed to press on. Just yesterday, Cambridge Analytica's official Twitter account tweeted out a link to a website refuting the waves of bad press the company has received with the caption, \"Get the Facts Behind the Facebook Story.\" In March, Business Insider reported that several of Cambridge Analytica's key players had set up a separate company called Emerdata in the UK last year.

Cambridge Analytica marketed itself as a provider of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients. After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm\u2019s help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a \u201csecret sauce\u201d it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could. One unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia is whether Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time messages during the campaign that were anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive. Bannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm, and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation.

Issie Lapowsky Cambridge Analytica, the embattled data firm that worked on President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, has told employees it is shutting down, along with its UK counterpart SCL Elections. The move, which impacts all offices of both companies worldwide, comes amid recent revelations that the company harvested the data of up to 87 million Facebook users without their consent, according to multiple sources close to the company. The decision to close the company's doors internationally was announced to employees during a global town hall meeting, held in the firm's New York City offices Wednesday. The company's reportedly recently appointed CEO Julian Wheatland told staffers the company had evaluated all options and no longer saw a way forward. One source says that New York employees were told to pack up and leave immediately, with few details about how they'll be compensated going forward.

According to a source, the decision also impacts SCL Defense, which has done work for the US government. The Wall Street Journal reports that SCL Group founder Nigel Oakes confirmed both SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica are closing. In March, The New York Times, alongside The Guardian and The Observer, published simultaneous accounts from a former whistleblower named Christopher Wylie, who reported that Cambridge Analytica had hired a researcher to conduct a psychological profile of the American electorate. The researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, built a personality quiz app that collected data on anyone who took it, as well as on their friends. Kogan sold that data to Cambridge Analytica to develop so-called \"psychographic profiles\" of American voters. Hours before the news broke, Facebook cut Cambridge Analytica and SCL off from its platform, deeply wounding a company that had already lost market share in both its political and commercial business. Shortly after, Channel 4 news in the UK aired undercover videos in which the former CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, was recorded bragging about using underhanded tactics like bribery and entrapment on behalf of his clients. In the statement put out by Cambridge Analytica, the company noted the results of an internal investigation which concluded that the allegations against it were not \"borne out by the facts.\u201d Angela Watercutter Steven Levy Steven Levy Andy Greenberg Nix was removed as CEO in March, but the company vowed to press on. Just yesterday, Cambridge Analytica's official Twitter account tweeted out a link to a website refuting the waves of bad press the company has received with the caption, \"Get the Facts Behind the Facebook Story.\" In March, Business Insider reported that several of Cambridge Analytica's key players had set up a separate company called Emerdata in the UK last year. Cambridge Analytica's main funder Rebekah Mercer sits on that company's board. Cambridge Analytica and SCL continue to be the subject of an investigation by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office into the role both companies played in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

The British-based company and its affiliate, SCL Elections, are filing insolvency proceedings in Britain and bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. Cambridge Analytica said a \u201csiege of media coverage\u201d of its dealings with Facebook has driven away customers, leaving the business no longer viable. It said reports about how it obtained and used Facebook user data were unfounded. \u201cDespite the company\u2019s efforts to correct the record,  has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\u201d the company said in a statement. Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research used the quiz app \u201cThis Is Your Digital Life\u201d to gather data on 270,000 users \u2014 and the users\u2019 friends, who did not participate in the quiz \u2014 which it then shared with Cambridge Analytica in 2015. The company used the demographic information from 87 million Facebook users to target political advertising. In March, whistleblower and Cambridge Analytica co-founder Christopher Wylie revealed the company was holding onto user data without their consent even after Facebook told the company to delete it. Wylie said the company was initially funded by billionaire Robert Mercer and his boss was former Breitbart founder and White House adviser Steve Bannon. Wylie said leadership at Cambridge Analytica wanted to fight a \u201cculture war.\u201d \u201cRules don\u2019t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it\u2019s all fair,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to fight a culture war in America.\u201d \u201cCambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\u201d Wylie said he used coding to execute Bannon and Mercer\u2019s idea to combine big data and social media to target Facebook users based on psychological profiles. On March 20, Cambridge Analytica suspended CEO Alexander Nix and said it was investigating comments Nix made in an undercover recording. He said the company could secretly compromise political rivals by arranging smear campaigns, setting up encounters with prostitutes and staging bribery situations. Counsel Julian Malins, who conducted Cambridge Analytica\u2019s internal investigation, said allegations against the firm were not \u201cborne out by the facts.\u201d \u201cI had full access to all members of staff and documents in the preparation of my report,\u201d Malins said. \u201cMy findings entirely reflect the amazement of the staff, on watching the television programmes and reading the sensationalistic reporting, that any of these media outlets could have been talking about the company for which they worked. Nothing of what they heard or read resonated with what they actually did for a living.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign used the services of Cambridge Analytica for the 2016 presidential election.

A source close to the matter told the Journal that the company is closing its doors because it lost several clients in recent months and faces growing legal fees as part of the Facebook investigation. Cambridge Analytica has been at the heart of the data scandal that has rocked Facebook, the world's largest social network, and led to calls for more regulation of user data. Facebook banned the political data analysis firm in March, and said it believes data from up to 87 million people was \"improperly shared\" with Cambridge Analytica. \"Facebook's trying to move past this all, and this is kind of the next step in that,\" Ian Sherr, the executive editor of CNET News, said about Cambridge Analytica's closure. \"This company is no longer going to be a thorn in their side in the real world. It's now a rhetorical thorn in their side that people will bring up quite often whenever concerned about privacy.\" The man who mined who data for Cambridge Analytica is a scientist named Aleksandr Kogan. He developed an app that harvested data from tens of millions of unwitting Facebook users, CBS News' Lesley Stahl reported last month for \"60 Minutes.\" He asked Facebook users to take a survey and used their answers to build psychological profiles meant to predict their behavior. When doing that, he failed to disclose that what he was really after was access to their friends -- tens of millions of people he could not otherwise reach easily. He also didn't disclose that he was doing the survey for Cambridge Analytica, which used the material to influence people on behalf of political clients. Kogan acknowledged giving the data to Cambridge Analytica and apologized for his actions in the \"60 Minutes\" interview. He said he was \"sincerely sorry\" about the way he and \"tens of thousands\" of other app developers took advantage of what he said was Facebook's lax data policy enforcement, but he doesn't think he really did anything wrong. As political consultants, Cambridge Analytica was hired by campaigns to analyze voters and target them with ads. In the 2016 presidential election, it worked first for Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign, then later for Donald Trump, though his campaign says they didn't use the Kogan data. The Republican benefactors Robert and Rebekah Mercer were Cambridge Analytica's financial backers, and Steve Bannon was on the board. Cambridge Analytica suspended chief executive Alexander Nix in March after he and other senior executives at the firm were caught on video saying they would go beyond using data to hurt a client's rival political candidate. Those tactics, Nix said in a report broadcast by the U.K.'s Channel 4, included entrapping politicians to influence an election's outcome. Late last month, Kogan took questions from British lawmakers. First published on May 2, 2018 / 2:59 PM EDT \u00a9 2018 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.
