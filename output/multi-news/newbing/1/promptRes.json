There are 104 GI Bill beneficiaries on MIT's campus, worth some $3 million in tuition to the university. At least 20 were impacted by huge delays in benefits that include tuition and up to $3,000 per month in housing allowances. The issue mostly stems from school officials never properly applying for some courses to be approved for GI Bill funding from the Department of Veterans Affairs, while admitting students with promises that the VA would support their education, an oversight that is becoming a pattern at major universities. \"The school totally dropped the ball here, and no one can give me straight answers,\" Michael Luu, an aerospace engineering Ph.D. student who has spent months at the school unsure how he is going to pay for its tuition and relies on the GI Bill's housing allowance to make ends meet, told Military.com. News of MIT's benefits issues follows a failure at Howard University, another prestigious private university, where a Military.com investigation found that student veterans suffered through at least a year of clerical errors and misfiled paperwork, leaving some on the verge of losing their homes. Read Next: As US Troops and Families Go Hungry, They Don\u2019t Trust the Pentagon for Help The systemic failure at Howard culminated in the District of Columbia State Approving Agency, which oversees GI Bill policy compliance, threatening to cut Howard off from GI Bill funding, which would have left some 235 beneficiaries on campus displaced and likely having to find a new school, and possibly cost the school at least $6.3 million a year in lost money from the benefits. Almost immediately after the Military.com investigation was published, Howard scrambled and was able to keep its status as a GI Bill-approved school. The school official who handled veteran benefits left the job almost immediately after publication of the story. Will Hubbard, vice president for veterans and military policy for Veterans Education Success, a GI Bill advocacy group in Washington, D.C., told Military.com that the MIT and Howard situations are a bad combination of the VA's mismanaged priorities in targeting prestigious institutions instead of rooting out bogus schools -- and the schools themselves failing to adequately manage student veterans. \"They  are just kind of aggressive in areas they shouldn't be on these administrative errors; it's a question of where VA is allocating its sources,\" Hubbard said. \"But these schools that accept GI Bill money but don\u2019t allocate resources to managing that, they're doing something wrong. It's VA being overly aggressive coming into contact with a school's mismanagement; both are wrong.\" Advocates and lawmakers previously focused much of their attention on schools of questionable educational merit that fly under the radar and often rely on GI Bill money to stay afloat. In 2018, the VA inspector general warned the department could waste $2.3 billion in payments to \"ineligible colleges\" through 2023. In the bulk of cases, the payments would go to predatory for-profit universities or fraudulent schools. But MIT and Howard are legitimate schools and offer some of the best-quality higher education in the country. Advocates are not aware of other cases like MIT and Howard but, given the recent issues with those prestigious schools, Hubbard said it's very likely there are other major universities fumbling military scholarships, underscoring the need for student veterans to be cognizant of whether their programs, not just the schools themselves, are VA certified. Military.com spoke to multiple MIT officials, student veterans on campus, and officials with the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education, which acts as the middleman between the VA and schools to approve programs in an effort to curtail fraud and preserve the integrity of the GI Bill. The GI Bill benefit is one of the federal government's largest, and, many argue, most successful entitlement programs. Most sources interviewed had a different understanding of the specifics of the MIT problem and its scope. Issues appear to have started in February, the beginning of the spring semester, when the school did not properly apply for eligibility of its dual-degree Leaders for Global Operations engineering program. The school also has never sought approval for its Ph.D. programs. Yet most students, including those in doctoral programs, interviewed by Military.com did not see problems with their funding until the summer or fall semesters. Schools typically must coordinate with regulators annually for courses to be eligible for student veterans to use military scholarships. \"There were some periods we submitted information, and we didn't receive a response for many months,\" Ian Waitz, the school's vice chancellor, told Military.com, referring to a back-and-forth between the school and state-level GI Bill approving authorities. \"The VA has a set of policies that are designed for very good reasons to stop predatory behavior that require some specifics on what you need to complete a\n\nquestion: What happened to some veterans at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "They lost GI Bill eligibility for one of its programs and never sought approval for doctoral courses due to a series of paperwork snafus and poor communication with state approving authorities.", "usage": 1139}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

So we need to understand exactly what is needed, go program by program so that our descriptions satisfy VA requirements.\" In addition to the Ph.D. programs never being approved, the state approving agency acting on behalf of the VA yanked MIT's Global Leadership dual-degree program eligibility after an audit of the school's GI Bill compliance was conducted and it was discovered the program should never have been verified because the school never submitted it in its catalog to approving authorities. It is unclear how students were able to use the GI Bill for unapproved programs; it could have been an oversight by the VA until the audit. But Military.com could not confirm specifics on the timeline of events. \"They never asked for approval; we can't approve things if they don't ask,\" an official who oversees GI Bill approval for schools, told Military.com on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. \"When we asked them for the information, they couldn't provide it.\" To protect students from enrolling in schools with uncertified programs, former President Barack Obama signed an executive order in 2012 telling universities that courses must be approved by the VA before enrolling students. \"If there are any shortcomings with respect to that standard which occurred during the pandemic, we will seek to address them expeditiously,\" Waitz said. In the meantime, Waitz said that any of the school's GI Bill beneficiaries whose programs are in limbo or continue to not be approved by education auditors will have their tuition and housing allowance covered by the school. The Global Leadership program was retroactively approved earlier this fall, setting up students to potentially get funds from the VA covering the gap in program approval dating back to the beginning of the year. He added that the school is in the middle of getting doctoral programs certified for GI Bill use. But it's unclear why those programs weren't approved to begin with, which is seemingly rare for schools to not have all of their courses approved. Luu stopped receiving his GI Bill benefits at MIT in September, including his earned scholarship to cover a massive chunk of tuition and about $3,000 per month in a housing allowance, money he relies on heavily for living expenses. \"It has just been silence from the school's end on what the next steps are. It has become a growing frustration, and no one will tell me what the problem is,\" Luu, who served as an infantry officer in the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade, told Military.com. Last month, MIT's aerospace department gave Luu what is effectively an impromptu scholarship of $27,000 to cover tuition costs while the administration figures out how to certify Ph.D. programs. However, Luu said he has not received all the compensation he has earned, and the school's financial services personnel are not sure how that money is supposed to be issued. But Luu said there's no plan for next semester, which begins in February. School officials have been telling him for the better part of the past year his program would be certified, but have not given him a timeline. The problem spurred Luu to file a congressional complaint to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who sits on the Armed Services Committee. Congressional complaints are a means for constituents to contact their senators or House representatives to help resolve issues, often involving federal benefits. Andrew Tresansky, a student in the Global Leadership program, had his spring semester covered by the GI Bill, but the money stopped coming in the summer and he is out roughly $10,000. The program's certification was not done in time for fall, and he paid for schooling with a separate grant and out of pocket, although the VA reimbursed him in early November. The school also paid him some money he lost earlier in the fall semester, but not for what he paid out during the summer. \"I'm saving up for a house, so I was lucky in that respect,\" said Tresansky, who previously served as a naval submarine officer. \"I'm lucky. My wife has a good job; we had a lot saved up. But we weren't planning to spend that money this way.\" Tresansky says he appreciates MIT stepping in, covering some of the lost housing allowance for the fall semester and tuition. However, it is unclear why the school hasn't covered the summer semester or how long it will take the VA to provide back pay to students given the LGO program is now certified. \"MIT has been trying to do the right thing, and VA has been difficult to deal with,\" he said. Some students Military.com spoke to pointed to a lack of a student veterans office on campus, and clear points of contact -- a common staple at most universities -- for those having GI Bill issues. MIT currently has two officials charged with certifying courses, but that staff also fill other roles at the school.

Some students are frustrated that MIT, of all schools, stumbled over military scholarships to begin with. \"You're profiting off the Defense Department,\" Luu said of the school. \"There's a disconnect.\" If you are a beneficiary of any military scholarships such as the GI Bill or National Guard Tuition Assistance and your school has encountered problems certifying your program or any class, please contact steve.beynon@military.com.

The Army veteran and his Chicago lawyer are asking the Supreme Court to take his case, which could help other long-serving vets tap college educational benefits for themselves and their families that they earned under more than one version of the GI Bill. Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times Arguing that he was wrongly denied GI Bill educational benefits, Rudisill is taking his fight to the Supreme Court in a legal quest that his Chicago attorney hopes will open up additional college benefits for himself and others and recognize \u201cwhat veterans have given to this nation.\u201d If the high court agrees to hear his appeal, its decision in the much-watched case could affect 2 million U.S. military veterans who served at least six years and earned educational benefits under more than one version of the GI Bill, a series of federal laws that entitles vets to benefits for their service. Rudisill says the federal Department of Veterans Affairs used what a lower-court ruling in his favor agreed were \u201cabsurd\u201d calculations that shortchanged him on financial support for postgraduate schooling that he had hoped to use to change careers and help other vets. He\u2019s right, former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been of the mind that, when in doubt, always defer to the veteran,\u201d says Hagel, a Vietnam War combat veteran who, as a Republican U.S. senator representing Nebraska, helped marshal bipartisan support for the passage in 2008 of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Hagel says in an interview that the aim of the law was to aid veterans. Asked about Rudisill\u2019s case, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s the veteran who deserves the break here.\u201d Former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is a Vietnam War vet who, as a Republican U.S. senator from Nebraska, helped win passage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Mark Wilson / Getty Images Enacted as a way to help keep people in military service longer and stabilize the nation\u2019s all-volunteer armed forces, the Post-9/11 GI Bill was the first upgrade of the original law in almost 25 years and now accounts for the bulk of GI Bill benefits, according to the Congressional Research Service. Rudisill earned educational benefits under two separate GI Bills: He enlisted in the Army in 2000. After getting out in 2002, he used about 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for college, then returned to the military in 2004 after friends were killed in action. He initially joined the North Carolina National Guard, later becoming a commissioned Army officer, serving five more years on active duty, including two tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He was wounded in suicide-bomb attacks and by roadside bombs. And, as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, he helped save lives by turning back a Taliban assault on a remote outpost while directing medical evacuations under fire. He was awarded the Bronze Star, among other honors, and attained the rank of captain. A wounded James Rudisill when he was medically evacuated in 2005 to Balad Air Base\u2019s combat support hospital in Iraq. Provided After leaving the Army, he joined the FBI, where his work has included investigating ISIS supporters and white supremacists. Under federal law, veterans can use benefits they\u2019ve earned under both the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for a maximum of 48 months of college or other higher education. Having previously used just over 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for his bachelor\u2019s degree, Rudisill figured he had about 22 months of benefits remaining. He planned to tap that number of months from his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to get a divinity degree at Yale University so he could return to the Army as a chaplain and minister to troops. But the VA calculated his remaining benefits differently. The agency figured that, because Rudisill still had 10 months of unused Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits, it would give him only that much, converted to Post-9/11 benefits. And that was all he could get, according to the VA. That would come to a total of 36 months under the two plans \u2014 12 months fewer than the combined maximum of 48 months that he\u2019d counted on. That ruined his chance to go to Yale, to which he\u2019d already been accepted but which he couldn\u2019t afford without the GI Bill money. Rudisill, who lives in Virginia, sued and won twice, but then saw that court victory overturned on appeal. That\u2019s the ruling he wants the Supreme Court to overturn if the court decides to hear his case. Rudisill has been fighting the VA for so long that, now 43, he\u2019s too old to be accepted into the Army chaplain program. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me,\ufffd\n\nquestion: What happened to some veterans at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1090}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times One of his lawyers calls Rudisill\u2019s circumstances \u201ca trap for the unwary\u201d that can ensnare all veterans who use part of their Montgomery GI Bill benefits and expect to be able to separately tap Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Rudisill won a victory in 2019 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \u2014 the federal court with exclusive jurisdiction on veterans\u2019 matters \u2014 ruled in his favor, saying Congress never intended to shortchange veterans. The federal government appealed, and Rudisill won again in 2021, when a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with him. But the VA asked for a reconsideration by the full bench of appellate judges. In December, a majority of the full appellate court sided with the government. A VA spokesman won\u2019t comment beyond saying agency officials agree with the appellate court ruling. \u201cIt was immensely disappointing,\u201d Rudisill says. \u201cAt this point, not for myself, but for the millions of veterans who are stymied by this very narrow interpretation of the statute.\u201d Misha Tseytlin, a Chicago partner in the law firm Troutman Pepper, is part of Rudisill\u2019s all-volunteer legal team. The lawyers argue that the VA\u2019s calculations don\u2019t make sense based on the laws themselves and also based on court rulings favoring veterans going back to World War II. That so-called \u201cpro-veteran canon\u201d says that \u201cbecause veterans have given so much to this nation, if there\u2019s any ambiguity, give the vets the benefit of the doubt concerning benefits,\u201d Tseytlin says. Misha Tseytlin, the Chicago lawyer representing James Rudisill in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Pat Nabong / Sun-Times Tim McHugh, a former Army paratrooper who is another lawyer on Rudisill\u2019s team, says Congress\u2019 intent must be considered. \u201cThink about what is the purpose of these programs in the first place,\u201d he says. Hagel \u2014 who was a deputy VA administrator under President Ronald Reagan and Defense secretary under President Barack Obama \u2014 says that when Democrat Jim Webb of Virginia proposed the 2008 law, he enthusiastically agreed to co-sponsor it to help vets readjust to civilian life. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, which took effect in 2009, provides added educational benefits \u2014 including being able to share those benefits with a veteran\u2019s children or spouse \u2014 in exchange for staying on in the military longer. \u201cWe were sending these men and women back into combat for one, two, three, four tours and more,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cYou are counting on these people to go back and back and back.\u201d Of Rudisill\u2019s case, Hagel says: \u201cI hope the Supreme Court takes it up, and I hope they study it very carefully and look at all the factors.\u201d If they do, he says, the pro-veteran canon should tip the scales toward Rudisill and others like him. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed they deserve a little extra edge,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cVets don\u2019t expect anything free. But they do expect some kind of acknowledgement. And it\u2019s an investment. When you educate a veteran, you are making an investment in the country.\u201d Retired Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Petta, who got his undergraduate degree from Southern Illinois University through a Navy program, is in the same position as Rudisill. Petta\u2019s story was included in a friend-of-the-court brief in Rudisill\u2019s case last year. The Boston-area man enlisted in the Navy in 1992, serving as a submarine technician while taking classes from SIU online. He left the Navy in 2000 but rejoined after 9/11. In 2002, he became a Coast Guard officer and later was accepted into a Coast Guard law school program, for which he used just over 33 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits. During two decades in the Coast Guard, he also earned Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, which he never touched. Going by the 48-month maximum, Petta still would have had nearly 15 months of college benefits to transfer to his children. But the VA used the same math that it did with Rudisill, saying Petta had less than three months available \u2014 shorting him of 12 months that\n\nquestion: What happened to some veterans at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1055}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Provided Petta calls the VA\u2019s decisions \u201chorribly bureaucratic.\u201d He says he was told that if he had used up the three remaining months of Montgomery GI Bill benefits before applying to use his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, his kids would have gotten the 12 months he thought he was entitled to. After he challenged the VA\u2019s decision, he got a form letter saying his son could get 14 months and 23 days of his benefits. He celebrated \u2014 and then another letter arrived saying his son could get only two months and 23 days. \u201cIt\u2019s a house of mirrors,\u201d Petta says. \u201cI\u2019m not asking anybody to feel bad for me. But what frustrates me is there are service members who are much worse off than I am.\u201d Veterans and their advocates have been closely watching Rudisill\u2019s case. Among them: U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a retired Army lieutenant colonel who flew combat missions in Iraq, was awarded the Purple Heart and was an assistant VA secretary under Obama. Duckworth\u2019s spokeswoman says the senator \u201cbelieves in the veterans canon that, if there is ambiguity in the laws providing benefits, courts should decide cases in a manner that benefits the veterans seeking benefits.\u201d U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth: Give vets the benefit of the doubt in deciding benefits. AP Aniela Szymanski, a Nevada lawyer who specializes in veterans issues, says the December appellate decision in Rudisill\u2019s case glossed over that long tradition of law regarding vets. \u201cIf the court was going to err on any side, it should have been on the side of the veterans,\u201d says Szymanski, who served active duty in the Marine Corps and remains an officer in the Marine Reserves.

On March 30, the California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education officially withdrew GI Bill approval for all coursework offered by the University of Arizona Global Campus, formerly known as Ashford University. The move followed a decision by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education revoking the school\u2019s license to operate in the state. Without that approval, students are unable to use GI Bill benefits to pay for any of the for-profit school\u2019s 90 education programs. In a statement, Department of Veterans Affairs officials said they are \u201cclosely monitoring this situation and notifying impacted GI Bill beneficiaries of CSAAVE\u2019s action and options that may be available to them.\u201d About 3,000 students who were enrolled in coursework at UAGC prior to March 30 will be able to continue receiving tuition and related benefits through the end of their current term. But whether they\u2019ll be able to complete degree programs with the school or at other institutions remains unclear. The school could also get a new operating license approved in a separate state, but that process can take months or years. It is unclear whether officials plan to do that and whether a new license could be approved before the fall semester. Under federal law, VA leaders can restore full GI Bill benefits for students \u201cwhose school has closed or been disapproved,\u201d but only under certain circumstances. VA officials said the UAGC situation does not fall under those specific requirements, although outside advocates have already called for the department to reconsider that interpretation. \u201cVeterans rely on VA\u2019s stamp of approval when choosing a school for their GI Bill benefits,\u201d Jennifer Esparza, legal affairs director at Veterans Education Success, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge VA to put veterans first by embracing the law that protects veterans from deceptive recruiting.\u201d In a separate legal fight last month, a California court fined Ashford University and its former owners more than $22 million in penalties for giving misleading statements to prospective students about their education programs and post-college career prospects. UAGC officials are not liable for those penalties, which are based on actions that occured before its ownership and name change in late 2020. Officials from Veterans Education Success argue that the VA could terminate the school\u2019s GI Bill eligibility based on that court ruling, thereby making students eligible for reinstatement of their GI Bill benefits. But for now, VA officials said they are not considering that step. VA paid more than $31 million in GI Bill benefits to UAGC in fiscal 2020, according to department records. Students with questions about GI Bill payments or other financial support from the department can contact VA\u2019s Education Call Center at 888-442-4551. Update: In a statement provided to Military Times a day after publication of this story, UAGC officials said they hope to obtain a new operating license in Arizona and regain eligibility for GI Bill funds as soon as possible. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to keep students in the classroom as we await the formal approval in Arizona,\u201d UAGC President Paul Pastorek said. \u201cThis is an unacceptable situation for our students and we have already made immediate adjustments such that UAGC is providing grant funds to all affected students so that their education is not impacted by this temporary lapse.\u201d Leo covers Congress, Veterans Affairs and the White House for Military Times.

News of MIT's benefits issues follows a failure at Howard University, another prestigious private university, where a Military.com investigation found that student veterans suffered through at least a year of clerical errors and misfiled paperwork, leaving some on the verge of losing their homes. Read Next: As US Troops and Families Go Hungry, They Don\u2019t Trust the Pentagon for Help The systemic failure at Howard culminated in the District of Columbia State Approving Agency, which oversees GI Bill policy compliance, threatening to cut Howard off from GI Bill funding, which would have left some 235 beneficiaries on campus displaced and likely having to find a new school, and possibly cost the school at least $6.3 million a year in lost money from the benefits. Almost immediately after the Military.com investigation was published, Howard scrambled and was able to keep its status as a GI Bill-approved school. The school official who handled veteran benefits left the job almost immediately after publication of the story. Will Hubbard, vice president for veterans and military policy for Veterans Education Success, a GI Bill advocacy group in Washington, D.C., told Military.com that the MIT and Howard situations are a bad combination of the VA's mismanaged priorities in targeting prestigious institutions instead of rooting out bogus schools -- and the schools themselves failing to adequately manage student veterans. \"They  are just kind of aggressive in areas they shouldn't be on these administrative errors; it's a question of where VA is allocating its sources,\" Hubbard said. \"But these schools that accept GI Bill money but don\u2019t allocate resources to managing that, they're doing something wrong. It's VA being overly aggressive coming into contact with a school's mismanagement; both are wrong.\" Advocates and lawmakers previously focused much of their attention on schools of questionable educational merit that fly under the radar and often rely on GI Bill money to stay afloat. In 2018, the VA inspector general warned the department could waste $2.3 billion in payments to \"ineligible colleges\" through 2023. In the bulk of cases, the payments would go to predatory for-profit universities or fraudulent schools. But MIT and Howard are legitimate schools and offer some of the best-quality higher education in the country. Advocates are not aware of other cases like MIT and Howard but, given the recent issues with those prestigious schools, Hubbard said it's very likely there are other major universities fumbling military scholarships, underscoring the need for student veterans to be cognizant of whether their programs, not just the schools themselves, are VA certified. Military.com spoke to multiple MIT officials, student veterans on campus, and officials with the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education, which acts as the middleman between the VA and schools to approve programs in an effort to curtail fraud and preserve the integrity of the GI Bill. The GI Bill benefit is one of the federal government's largest, and, many argue, most successful entitlement programs. Most sources interviewed had a different understanding of the specifics of the MIT problem and its scope. Issues appear to have started in February, the beginning of the spring semester, when the school did not properly apply for eligibility of its dual-degree Leaders for Global Operations engineering program. The school also has never sought approval for its Ph.D. programs. Yet most students, including those in doctoral programs, interviewed by Military.com did not see problems with their funding until the summer or fall semesters. Schools typically must coordinate with regulators annually for courses to be eligible for student veterans to use military scholarships. \"There were some periods we submitted information, and we didn't receive a response for many months,\" Ian Waitz, the school's vice chancellor, told Military.com, referring to a back-and-forth between the school and state-level GI Bill approving authorities. \"The VA has a set of policies that are designed for very good reasons to stop predatory behavior that require some specifics on what you need to complete a\n\nquestion: What is the main cause of the issue for the veterans at MIT?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "paperwork snafus and poor communication with state approving authorities.", "usage": 1119}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

So we need to understand exactly what is needed, go program by program so that our descriptions satisfy VA requirements.\" In addition to the Ph.D. programs never being approved, the state approving agency acting on behalf of the VA yanked MIT's Global Leadership dual-degree program eligibility after an audit of the school's GI Bill compliance was conducted and it was discovered the program should never have been verified because the school never submitted it in its catalog to approving authorities. It is unclear how students were able to use the GI Bill for unapproved programs; it could have been an oversight by the VA until the audit. But Military.com could not confirm specifics on the timeline of events. \"They never asked for approval; we can't approve things if they don't ask,\" an official who oversees GI Bill approval for schools, told Military.com on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. \"When we asked them for the information, they couldn't provide it.\" To protect students from enrolling in schools with uncertified programs, former President Barack Obama signed an executive order in 2012 telling universities that courses must be approved by the VA before enrolling students. \"If there are any shortcomings with respect to that standard which occurred during the pandemic, we will seek to address them expeditiously,\" Waitz said. In the meantime, Waitz said that any of the school's GI Bill beneficiaries whose programs are in limbo or continue to not be approved by education auditors will have their tuition and housing allowance covered by the school. The Global Leadership program was retroactively approved earlier this fall, setting up students to potentially get funds from the VA covering the gap in program approval dating back to the beginning of the year. He added that the school is in the middle of getting doctoral programs certified for GI Bill use. But it's unclear why those programs weren't approved to begin with, which is seemingly rare for schools to not have all of their courses approved. Luu stopped receiving his GI Bill benefits at MIT in September, including his earned scholarship to cover a massive chunk of tuition and about $3,000 per month in a housing allowance, money he relies on heavily for living expenses. \"It has just been silence from the school's end on what the next steps are. It has become a growing frustration, and no one will tell me what the problem is,\" Luu, who served as an infantry officer in the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade, told Military.com. Last month, MIT's aerospace department gave Luu what is effectively an impromptu scholarship of $27,000 to cover tuition costs while the administration figures out how to certify Ph.D. programs. However, Luu said he has not received all the compensation he has earned, and the school's financial services personnel are not sure how that money is supposed to be issued. But Luu said there's no plan for next semester, which begins in February. School officials have been telling him for the better part of the past year his program would be certified, but have not given him a timeline. The problem spurred Luu to file a congressional complaint to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who sits on the Armed Services Committee. Congressional complaints are a means for constituents to contact their senators or House representatives to help resolve issues, often involving federal benefits. Andrew Tresansky, a student in the Global Leadership program, had his spring semester covered by the GI Bill, but the money stopped coming in the summer and he is out roughly $10,000. The program's certification was not done in time for fall, and he paid for schooling with a separate grant and out of pocket, although the VA reimbursed him in early November. The school also paid him some money he lost earlier in the fall semester, but not for what he paid out during the summer. \"I'm saving up for a house, so I was lucky in that respect,\" said Tresansky, who previously served as a naval submarine officer. \"I'm lucky. My wife has a good job; we had a lot saved up. But we weren't planning to spend that money this way.\" Tresansky says he appreciates MIT stepping in, covering some of the lost housing allowance for the fall semester and tuition. However, it is unclear why the school hasn't covered the summer semester or how long it will take the VA to provide back pay to students given the LGO program is now certified. \"MIT has been trying to do the right thing, and VA has been difficult to deal with,\" he said. Some students Military.com spoke to pointed to a lack of a student veterans office on campus, and clear points of contact -- a common staple at most universities -- for those having GI Bill issues. MIT currently has two officials charged with certifying courses, but that staff also fill other roles at the school.

Some students are frustrated that MIT, of all schools, stumbled over military scholarships to begin with. \"You're profiting off the Defense Department,\" Luu said of the school. \"There's a disconnect.\" If you are a beneficiary of any military scholarships such as the GI Bill or National Guard Tuition Assistance and your school has encountered problems certifying your program or any class, please contact steve.beynon@military.com.

The Army veteran and his Chicago lawyer are asking the Supreme Court to take his case, which could help other long-serving vets tap college educational benefits for themselves and their families that they earned under more than one version of the GI Bill. Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times Arguing that he was wrongly denied GI Bill educational benefits, Rudisill is taking his fight to the Supreme Court in a legal quest that his Chicago attorney hopes will open up additional college benefits for himself and others and recognize \u201cwhat veterans have given to this nation.\u201d If the high court agrees to hear his appeal, its decision in the much-watched case could affect 2 million U.S. military veterans who served at least six years and earned educational benefits under more than one version of the GI Bill, a series of federal laws that entitles vets to benefits for their service. Rudisill says the federal Department of Veterans Affairs used what a lower-court ruling in his favor agreed were \u201cabsurd\u201d calculations that shortchanged him on financial support for postgraduate schooling that he had hoped to use to change careers and help other vets. He\u2019s right, former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been of the mind that, when in doubt, always defer to the veteran,\u201d says Hagel, a Vietnam War combat veteran who, as a Republican U.S. senator representing Nebraska, helped marshal bipartisan support for the passage in 2008 of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Hagel says in an interview that the aim of the law was to aid veterans. Asked about Rudisill\u2019s case, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s the veteran who deserves the break here.\u201d Former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is a Vietnam War vet who, as a Republican U.S. senator from Nebraska, helped win passage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Mark Wilson / Getty Images Enacted as a way to help keep people in military service longer and stabilize the nation\u2019s all-volunteer armed forces, the Post-9/11 GI Bill was the first upgrade of the original law in almost 25 years and now accounts for the bulk of GI Bill benefits, according to the Congressional Research Service. Rudisill earned educational benefits under two separate GI Bills: He enlisted in the Army in 2000. After getting out in 2002, he used about 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for college, then returned to the military in 2004 after friends were killed in action. He initially joined the North Carolina National Guard, later becoming a commissioned Army officer, serving five more years on active duty, including two tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He was wounded in suicide-bomb attacks and by roadside bombs. And, as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, he helped save lives by turning back a Taliban assault on a remote outpost while directing medical evacuations under fire. He was awarded the Bronze Star, among other honors, and attained the rank of captain. A wounded James Rudisill when he was medically evacuated in 2005 to Balad Air Base\u2019s combat support hospital in Iraq. Provided After leaving the Army, he joined the FBI, where his work has included investigating ISIS supporters and white supremacists. Under federal law, veterans can use benefits they\u2019ve earned under both the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for a maximum of 48 months of college or other higher education. Having previously used just over 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for his bachelor\u2019s degree, Rudisill figured he had about 22 months of benefits remaining. He planned to tap that number of months from his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to get a divinity degree at Yale University so he could return to the Army as a chaplain and minister to troops. But the VA calculated his remaining benefits differently. The agency figured that, because Rudisill still had 10 months of unused Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits, it would give him only that much, converted to Post-9/11 benefits. And that was all he could get, according to the VA. That would come to a total of 36 months under the two plans \u2014 12 months fewer than the combined maximum of 48 months that he\u2019d counted on. That ruined his chance to go to Yale, to which he\u2019d already been accepted but which he couldn\u2019t afford without the GI Bill money. Rudisill, who lives in Virginia, sued and won twice, but then saw that court victory overturned on appeal. That\u2019s the ruling he wants the Supreme Court to overturn if the court decides to hear his case. Rudisill has been fighting the VA for so long that, now 43, he\u2019s too old to be accepted into the Army chaplain program. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me,\ufffd\n\nquestion: What is the main cause of the issue for the veterans at MIT?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Use of absurd calculations by the federal Department of Veterans Affairs", "usage": 1100}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times One of his lawyers calls Rudisill\u2019s circumstances \u201ca trap for the unwary\u201d that can ensnare all veterans who use part of their Montgomery GI Bill benefits and expect to be able to separately tap Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Rudisill won a victory in 2019 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \u2014 the federal court with exclusive jurisdiction on veterans\u2019 matters \u2014 ruled in his favor, saying Congress never intended to shortchange veterans. The federal government appealed, and Rudisill won again in 2021, when a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with him. But the VA asked for a reconsideration by the full bench of appellate judges. In December, a majority of the full appellate court sided with the government. A VA spokesman won\u2019t comment beyond saying agency officials agree with the appellate court ruling. \u201cIt was immensely disappointing,\u201d Rudisill says. \u201cAt this point, not for myself, but for the millions of veterans who are stymied by this very narrow interpretation of the statute.\u201d Misha Tseytlin, a Chicago partner in the law firm Troutman Pepper, is part of Rudisill\u2019s all-volunteer legal team. The lawyers argue that the VA\u2019s calculations don\u2019t make sense based on the laws themselves and also based on court rulings favoring veterans going back to World War II. That so-called \u201cpro-veteran canon\u201d says that \u201cbecause veterans have given so much to this nation, if there\u2019s any ambiguity, give the vets the benefit of the doubt concerning benefits,\u201d Tseytlin says. Misha Tseytlin, the Chicago lawyer representing James Rudisill in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Pat Nabong / Sun-Times Tim McHugh, a former Army paratrooper who is another lawyer on Rudisill\u2019s team, says Congress\u2019 intent must be considered. \u201cThink about what is the purpose of these programs in the first place,\u201d he says. Hagel \u2014 who was a deputy VA administrator under President Ronald Reagan and Defense secretary under President Barack Obama \u2014 says that when Democrat Jim Webb of Virginia proposed the 2008 law, he enthusiastically agreed to co-sponsor it to help vets readjust to civilian life. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, which took effect in 2009, provides added educational benefits \u2014 including being able to share those benefits with a veteran\u2019s children or spouse \u2014 in exchange for staying on in the military longer. \u201cWe were sending these men and women back into combat for one, two, three, four tours and more,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cYou are counting on these people to go back and back and back.\u201d Of Rudisill\u2019s case, Hagel says: \u201cI hope the Supreme Court takes it up, and I hope they study it very carefully and look at all the factors.\u201d If they do, he says, the pro-veteran canon should tip the scales toward Rudisill and others like him. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed they deserve a little extra edge,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cVets don\u2019t expect anything free. But they do expect some kind of acknowledgement. And it\u2019s an investment. When you educate a veteran, you are making an investment in the country.\u201d Retired Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Petta, who got his undergraduate degree from Southern Illinois University through a Navy program, is in the same position as Rudisill. Petta\u2019s story was included in a friend-of-the-court brief in Rudisill\u2019s case last year. The Boston-area man enlisted in the Navy in 1992, serving as a submarine technician while taking classes from SIU online. He left the Navy in 2000 but rejoined after 9/11. In 2002, he became a Coast Guard officer and later was accepted into a Coast Guard law school program, for which he used just over 33 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits. During two decades in the Coast Guard, he also earned Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, which he never touched. Going by the 48-month maximum, Petta still would have had nearly 15 months of college benefits to transfer to his children. But the VA used the same math that it did with Rudisill, saying Petta had less than three months available \u2014 shorting him of 12 months that\n\nquestion: What is the main cause of the issue for the veterans at MIT?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1056}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

After he challenged the VA\u2019s decision, he got a form letter saying his son could get 14 months and 23 days of his benefits. He celebrated \u2014 and then another letter arrived saying his son could get only two months and 23 days. \u201cIt\u2019s a house of mirrors,\u201d Petta says. \u201cI\u2019m not asking anybody to feel bad for me. But what frustrates me is there are service members who are much worse off than I am.\u201d Veterans and their advocates have been closely watching Rudisill\u2019s case. Among them: U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a retired Army lieutenant colonel who flew combat missions in Iraq, was awarded the Purple Heart and was an assistant VA secretary under Obama. Duckworth\u2019s spokeswoman says the senator \u201cbelieves in the veterans canon that, if there is ambiguity in the laws providing benefits, courts should decide cases in a manner that benefits the veterans seeking benefits.\u201d U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth: Give vets the benefit of the doubt in deciding benefits. AP Aniela Szymanski, a Nevada lawyer who specializes in veterans issues, says the December appellate decision in Rudisill\u2019s case glossed over that long tradition of law regarding vets. \u201cIf the court was going to err on any side, it should have been on the side of the veterans,\u201d says Szymanski, who served active duty in the Marine Corps and remains an officer in the Marine Reserves.

On March 30, the California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education officially withdrew GI Bill approval for all coursework offered by the University of Arizona Global Campus, formerly known as Ashford University. The move followed a decision by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education revoking the school\u2019s license to operate in the state. Without that approval, students are unable to use GI Bill benefits to pay for any of the for-profit school\u2019s 90 education programs. In a statement, Department of Veterans Affairs officials said they are \u201cclosely monitoring this situation and notifying impacted GI Bill beneficiaries of CSAAVE\u2019s action and options that may be available to them.\u201d About 3,000 students who were enrolled in coursework at UAGC prior to March 30 will be able to continue receiving tuition and related benefits through the end of their current term. But whether they\u2019ll be able to complete degree programs with the school or at other institutions remains unclear. The school could also get a new operating license approved in a separate state, but that process can take months or years. It is unclear whether officials plan to do that and whether a new license could be approved before the fall semester. Under federal law, VA leaders can restore full GI Bill benefits for students \u201cwhose school has closed or been disapproved,\u201d but only under certain circumstances. VA officials said the UAGC situation does not fall under those specific requirements, although outside advocates have already called for the department to reconsider that interpretation. \u201cVeterans rely on VA\u2019s stamp of approval when choosing a school for their GI Bill benefits,\u201d Jennifer Esparza, legal affairs director at Veterans Education Success, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge VA to put veterans first by embracing the law that protects veterans from deceptive recruiting.\u201d In a separate legal fight last month, a California court fined Ashford University and its former owners more than $22 million in penalties for giving misleading statements to prospective students about their education programs and post-college career prospects. UAGC officials are not liable for those penalties, which are based on actions that occured before its ownership and name change in late 2020. Officials from Veterans Education Success argue that the VA could terminate the school\u2019s GI Bill eligibility based on that court ruling, thereby making students eligible for reinstatement of their GI Bill benefits. But for now, VA officials said they are not considering that step. VA paid more than $31 million in GI Bill benefits to UAGC in fiscal 2020, according to department records. Students with questions about GI Bill payments or other financial support from the department can contact VA\u2019s Education Call Center at 888-442-4551. Update: In a statement provided to Military Times a day after publication of this story, UAGC officials said they hope to obtain a new operating license in Arizona and regain eligibility for GI Bill funds as soon as possible. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to keep students in the classroom as we await the formal approval in Arizona,\u201d UAGC President Paul Pastorek said. \u201cThis is an unacceptable situation for our students and we have already made immediate adjustments such that UAGC is providing grant funds to all affected students so that their education is not impacted by this temporary lapse.\u201d Leo covers Congress, Veterans Affairs and the White House for Military Times.

Will Hubbard, vice president for veterans and military policy for Veterans Education Success, a GI Bill advocacy group in Washington, D.C., told Military.com that the MIT and Howard situations are a bad combination of the VA's mismanaged priorities in targeting prestigious institutions instead of rooting out bogus schools -- and the schools themselves failing to adequately manage student veterans. \"They  are just kind of aggressive in areas they shouldn't be on these administrative errors; it's a question of where VA is allocating its sources,\" Hubbard said. \"But these schools that accept GI Bill money but don\u2019t allocate resources to managing that, they're doing something wrong. It's VA being overly aggressive coming into contact with a school's mismanagement; both are wrong.\" Advocates and lawmakers previously focused much of their attention on schools of questionable educational merit that fly under the radar and often rely on GI Bill money to stay afloat. In 2018, the VA inspector general warned the department could waste $2.3 billion in payments to \"ineligible colleges\" through 2023. In the bulk of cases, the payments would go to predatory for-profit universities or fraudulent schools. But MIT and Howard are legitimate schools and offer some of the best-quality higher education in the country. Advocates are not aware of other cases like MIT and Howard but, given the recent issues with those prestigious schools, Hubbard said it's very likely there are other major universities fumbling military scholarships, underscoring the need for student veterans to be cognizant of whether their programs, not just the schools themselves, are VA certified. Military.com spoke to multiple MIT officials, student veterans on campus, and officials with the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education, which acts as the middleman between the VA and schools to approve programs in an effort to curtail fraud and preserve the integrity of the GI Bill. The GI Bill benefit is one of the federal government's largest, and, many argue, most successful entitlement programs. Most sources interviewed had a different understanding of the specifics of the MIT problem and its scope. Issues appear to have started in February, the beginning of the spring semester, when the school did not properly apply for eligibility of its dual-degree Leaders for Global Operations engineering program. The school also has never sought approval for its Ph.D. programs. Yet most students, including those in doctoral programs, interviewed by Military.com did not see problems with their funding until the summer or fall semesters. Schools typically must coordinate with regulators annually for courses to be eligible for student veterans to use military scholarships. \"There were some periods we submitted information, and we didn't receive a response for many months,\" Ian Waitz, the school's vice chancellor, told Military.com, referring to a back-and-forth between the school and state-level GI Bill approving authorities. \"The VA has a set of policies that are designed for very good reasons to stop predatory behavior that require some specifics on what you need to complete a\n\nquestion: How did Howard University respond after a Military.com investigation was published?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Howard scrambled and was able to keep its status as a GI Bill-approved school and the school official who handled veteran benefits left the job almost immediately after publication of the story.", "usage": 1139}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

So we need to understand exactly what is needed, go program by program so that our descriptions satisfy VA requirements.\" In addition to the Ph.D. programs never being approved, the state approving agency acting on behalf of the VA yanked MIT's Global Leadership dual-degree program eligibility after an audit of the school's GI Bill compliance was conducted and it was discovered the program should never have been verified because the school never submitted it in its catalog to approving authorities. It is unclear how students were able to use the GI Bill for unapproved programs; it could have been an oversight by the VA until the audit. But Military.com could not confirm specifics on the timeline of events. \"They never asked for approval; we can't approve things if they don't ask,\" an official who oversees GI Bill approval for schools, told Military.com on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. \"When we asked them for the information, they couldn't provide it.\" To protect students from enrolling in schools with uncertified programs, former President Barack Obama signed an executive order in 2012 telling universities that courses must be approved by the VA before enrolling students. \"If there are any shortcomings with respect to that standard which occurred during the pandemic, we will seek to address them expeditiously,\" Waitz said. In the meantime, Waitz said that any of the school's GI Bill beneficiaries whose programs are in limbo or continue to not be approved by education auditors will have their tuition and housing allowance covered by the school. The Global Leadership program was retroactively approved earlier this fall, setting up students to potentially get funds from the VA covering the gap in program approval dating back to the beginning of the year. He added that the school is in the middle of getting doctoral programs certified for GI Bill use. But it's unclear why those programs weren't approved to begin with, which is seemingly rare for schools to not have all of their courses approved. Luu stopped receiving his GI Bill benefits at MIT in September, including his earned scholarship to cover a massive chunk of tuition and about $3,000 per month in a housing allowance, money he relies on heavily for living expenses. \"It has just been silence from the school's end on what the next steps are. It has become a growing frustration, and no one will tell me what the problem is,\" Luu, who served as an infantry officer in the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade, told Military.com. Last month, MIT's aerospace department gave Luu what is effectively an impromptu scholarship of $27,000 to cover tuition costs while the administration figures out how to certify Ph.D. programs. However, Luu said he has not received all the compensation he has earned, and the school's financial services personnel are not sure how that money is supposed to be issued. But Luu said there's no plan for next semester, which begins in February. School officials have been telling him for the better part of the past year his program would be certified, but have not given him a timeline. The problem spurred Luu to file a congressional complaint to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who sits on the Armed Services Committee. Congressional complaints are a means for constituents to contact their senators or House representatives to help resolve issues, often involving federal benefits. Andrew Tresansky, a student in the Global Leadership program, had his spring semester covered by the GI Bill, but the money stopped coming in the summer and he is out roughly $10,000. The program's certification was not done in time for fall, and he paid for schooling with a separate grant and out of pocket, although the VA reimbursed him in early November. The school also paid him some money he lost earlier in the fall semester, but not for what he paid out during the summer. \"I'm saving up for a house, so I was lucky in that respect,\" said Tresansky, who previously served as a naval submarine officer. \"I'm lucky. My wife has a good job; we had a lot saved up. But we weren't planning to spend that money this way.\" Tresansky says he appreciates MIT stepping in, covering some of the lost housing allowance for the fall semester and tuition. However, it is unclear why the school hasn't covered the summer semester or how long it will take the VA to provide back pay to students given the LGO program is now certified. \"MIT has been trying to do the right thing, and VA has been difficult to deal with,\" he said. Some students Military.com spoke to pointed to a lack of a student veterans office on campus, and clear points of contact -- a common staple at most universities -- for those having GI Bill issues. MIT currently has two officials charged with certifying courses, but that staff also fill other roles at the school.

Some students are frustrated that MIT, of all schools, stumbled over military scholarships to begin with. \"You're profiting off the Defense Department,\" Luu said of the school. \"There's a disconnect.\" If you are a beneficiary of any military scholarships such as the GI Bill or National Guard Tuition Assistance and your school has encountered problems certifying your program or any class, please contact steve.beynon@military.com.

The Army veteran and his Chicago lawyer are asking the Supreme Court to take his case, which could help other long-serving vets tap college educational benefits for themselves and their families that they earned under more than one version of the GI Bill. Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times Arguing that he was wrongly denied GI Bill educational benefits, Rudisill is taking his fight to the Supreme Court in a legal quest that his Chicago attorney hopes will open up additional college benefits for himself and others and recognize \u201cwhat veterans have given to this nation.\u201d If the high court agrees to hear his appeal, its decision in the much-watched case could affect 2 million U.S. military veterans who served at least six years and earned educational benefits under more than one version of the GI Bill, a series of federal laws that entitles vets to benefits for their service. Rudisill says the federal Department of Veterans Affairs used what a lower-court ruling in his favor agreed were \u201cabsurd\u201d calculations that shortchanged him on financial support for postgraduate schooling that he had hoped to use to change careers and help other vets. He\u2019s right, former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been of the mind that, when in doubt, always defer to the veteran,\u201d says Hagel, a Vietnam War combat veteran who, as a Republican U.S. senator representing Nebraska, helped marshal bipartisan support for the passage in 2008 of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Hagel says in an interview that the aim of the law was to aid veterans. Asked about Rudisill\u2019s case, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s the veteran who deserves the break here.\u201d Former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is a Vietnam War vet who, as a Republican U.S. senator from Nebraska, helped win passage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Mark Wilson / Getty Images Enacted as a way to help keep people in military service longer and stabilize the nation\u2019s all-volunteer armed forces, the Post-9/11 GI Bill was the first upgrade of the original law in almost 25 years and now accounts for the bulk of GI Bill benefits, according to the Congressional Research Service. Rudisill earned educational benefits under two separate GI Bills: He enlisted in the Army in 2000. After getting out in 2002, he used about 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for college, then returned to the military in 2004 after friends were killed in action. He initially joined the North Carolina National Guard, later becoming a commissioned Army officer, serving five more years on active duty, including two tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He was wounded in suicide-bomb attacks and by roadside bombs. And, as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, he helped save lives by turning back a Taliban assault on a remote outpost while directing medical evacuations under fire. He was awarded the Bronze Star, among other honors, and attained the rank of captain. A wounded James Rudisill when he was medically evacuated in 2005 to Balad Air Base\u2019s combat support hospital in Iraq. Provided After leaving the Army, he joined the FBI, where his work has included investigating ISIS supporters and white supremacists. Under federal law, veterans can use benefits they\u2019ve earned under both the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for a maximum of 48 months of college or other higher education. Having previously used just over 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for his bachelor\u2019s degree, Rudisill figured he had about 22 months of benefits remaining. He planned to tap that number of months from his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to get a divinity degree at Yale University so he could return to the Army as a chaplain and minister to troops. But the VA calculated his remaining benefits differently. The agency figured that, because Rudisill still had 10 months of unused Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits, it would give him only that much, converted to Post-9/11 benefits. And that was all he could get, according to the VA. That would come to a total of 36 months under the two plans \u2014 12 months fewer than the combined maximum of 48 months that he\u2019d counted on. That ruined his chance to go to Yale, to which he\u2019d already been accepted but which he couldn\u2019t afford without the GI Bill money. Rudisill, who lives in Virginia, sued and won twice, but then saw that court victory overturned on appeal. That\u2019s the ruling he wants the Supreme Court to overturn if the court decides to hear his case. Rudisill has been fighting the VA for so long that, now 43, he\u2019s too old to be accepted into the Army chaplain program. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me,\ufffd\n\nquestion: How did Howard University respond after a Military.com investigation was published?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1090}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times One of his lawyers calls Rudisill\u2019s circumstances \u201ca trap for the unwary\u201d that can ensnare all veterans who use part of their Montgomery GI Bill benefits and expect to be able to separately tap Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Rudisill won a victory in 2019 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \u2014 the federal court with exclusive jurisdiction on veterans\u2019 matters \u2014 ruled in his favor, saying Congress never intended to shortchange veterans. The federal government appealed, and Rudisill won again in 2021, when a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with him. But the VA asked for a reconsideration by the full bench of appellate judges. In December, a majority of the full appellate court sided with the government. A VA spokesman won\u2019t comment beyond saying agency officials agree with the appellate court ruling. \u201cIt was immensely disappointing,\u201d Rudisill says. \u201cAt this point, not for myself, but for the millions of veterans who are stymied by this very narrow interpretation of the statute.\u201d Misha Tseytlin, a Chicago partner in the law firm Troutman Pepper, is part of Rudisill\u2019s all-volunteer legal team. The lawyers argue that the VA\u2019s calculations don\u2019t make sense based on the laws themselves and also based on court rulings favoring veterans going back to World War II. That so-called \u201cpro-veteran canon\u201d says that \u201cbecause veterans have given so much to this nation, if there\u2019s any ambiguity, give the vets the benefit of the doubt concerning benefits,\u201d Tseytlin says. Misha Tseytlin, the Chicago lawyer representing James Rudisill in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Pat Nabong / Sun-Times Tim McHugh, a former Army paratrooper who is another lawyer on Rudisill\u2019s team, says Congress\u2019 intent must be considered. \u201cThink about what is the purpose of these programs in the first place,\u201d he says. Hagel \u2014 who was a deputy VA administrator under President Ronald Reagan and Defense secretary under President Barack Obama \u2014 says that when Democrat Jim Webb of Virginia proposed the 2008 law, he enthusiastically agreed to co-sponsor it to help vets readjust to civilian life. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, which took effect in 2009, provides added educational benefits \u2014 including being able to share those benefits with a veteran\u2019s children or spouse \u2014 in exchange for staying on in the military longer. \u201cWe were sending these men and women back into combat for one, two, three, four tours and more,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cYou are counting on these people to go back and back and back.\u201d Of Rudisill\u2019s case, Hagel says: \u201cI hope the Supreme Court takes it up, and I hope they study it very carefully and look at all the factors.\u201d If they do, he says, the pro-veteran canon should tip the scales toward Rudisill and others like him. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed they deserve a little extra edge,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cVets don\u2019t expect anything free. But they do expect some kind of acknowledgement. And it\u2019s an investment. When you educate a veteran, you are making an investment in the country.\u201d Retired Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Petta, who got his undergraduate degree from Southern Illinois University through a Navy program, is in the same position as Rudisill. Petta\u2019s story was included in a friend-of-the-court brief in Rudisill\u2019s case last year. The Boston-area man enlisted in the Navy in 1992, serving as a submarine technician while taking classes from SIU online. He left the Navy in 2000 but rejoined after 9/11. In 2002, he became a Coast Guard officer and later was accepted into a Coast Guard law school program, for which he used just over 33 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits. During two decades in the Coast Guard, he also earned Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, which he never touched. Going by the 48-month maximum, Petta still would have had nearly 15 months of college benefits to transfer to his children. But the VA used the same math that it did with Rudisill, saying Petta had less than three months available \u2014 shorting him of 12 months that\n\nquestion: How did Howard University respond after a Military.com investigation was published?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1055}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Provided Petta calls the VA\u2019s decisions \u201chorribly bureaucratic.\u201d He says he was told that if he had used up the three remaining months of Montgomery GI Bill benefits before applying to use his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, his kids would have gotten the 12 months he thought he was entitled to. After he challenged the VA\u2019s decision, he got a form letter saying his son could get 14 months and 23 days of his benefits. He celebrated \u2014 and then another letter arrived saying his son could get only two months and 23 days. \u201cIt\u2019s a house of mirrors,\u201d Petta says. \u201cI\u2019m not asking anybody to feel bad for me. But what frustrates me is there are service members who are much worse off than I am.\u201d Veterans and their advocates have been closely watching Rudisill\u2019s case. Among them: U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a retired Army lieutenant colonel who flew combat missions in Iraq, was awarded the Purple Heart and was an assistant VA secretary under Obama. Duckworth\u2019s spokeswoman says the senator \u201cbelieves in the veterans canon that, if there is ambiguity in the laws providing benefits, courts should decide cases in a manner that benefits the veterans seeking benefits.\u201d U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth: Give vets the benefit of the doubt in deciding benefits. AP Aniela Szymanski, a Nevada lawyer who specializes in veterans issues, says the December appellate decision in Rudisill\u2019s case glossed over that long tradition of law regarding vets. \u201cIf the court was going to err on any side, it should have been on the side of the veterans,\u201d says Szymanski, who served active duty in the Marine Corps and remains an officer in the Marine Reserves.

On March 30, the California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education officially withdrew GI Bill approval for all coursework offered by the University of Arizona Global Campus, formerly known as Ashford University. The move followed a decision by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education revoking the school\u2019s license to operate in the state. Without that approval, students are unable to use GI Bill benefits to pay for any of the for-profit school\u2019s 90 education programs. In a statement, Department of Veterans Affairs officials said they are \u201cclosely monitoring this situation and notifying impacted GI Bill beneficiaries of CSAAVE\u2019s action and options that may be available to them.\u201d About 3,000 students who were enrolled in coursework at UAGC prior to March 30 will be able to continue receiving tuition and related benefits through the end of their current term. But whether they\u2019ll be able to complete degree programs with the school or at other institutions remains unclear. The school could also get a new operating license approved in a separate state, but that process can take months or years. It is unclear whether officials plan to do that and whether a new license could be approved before the fall semester. Under federal law, VA leaders can restore full GI Bill benefits for students \u201cwhose school has closed or been disapproved,\u201d but only under certain circumstances. VA officials said the UAGC situation does not fall under those specific requirements, although outside advocates have already called for the department to reconsider that interpretation. \u201cVeterans rely on VA\u2019s stamp of approval when choosing a school for their GI Bill benefits,\u201d Jennifer Esparza, legal affairs director at Veterans Education Success, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge VA to put veterans first by embracing the law that protects veterans from deceptive recruiting.\u201d In a separate legal fight last month, a California court fined Ashford University and its former owners more than $22 million in penalties for giving misleading statements to prospective students about their education programs and post-college career prospects. UAGC officials are not liable for those penalties, which are based on actions that occured before its ownership and name change in late 2020. Officials from Veterans Education Success argue that the VA could terminate the school\u2019s GI Bill eligibility based on that court ruling, thereby making students eligible for reinstatement of their GI Bill benefits. But for now, VA officials said they are not considering that step. VA paid more than $31 million in GI Bill benefits to UAGC in fiscal 2020, according to department records. Students with questions about GI Bill payments or other financial support from the department can contact VA\u2019s Education Call Center at 888-442-4551. Update: In a statement provided to Military Times a day after publication of this story, UAGC officials said they hope to obtain a new operating license in Arizona and regain eligibility for GI Bill funds as soon as possible. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to keep students in the classroom as we await the formal approval in Arizona,\u201d UAGC President Paul Pastorek said. \u201cThis is an unacceptable situation for our students and we have already made immediate adjustments such that UAGC is providing grant funds to all affected students so that their education is not impacted by this temporary lapse.\u201d Leo covers Congress, Veterans Affairs and the White House for Military Times.

There are 104 GI Bill beneficiaries on MIT's campus, worth some $3 million in tuition to the university. At least 20 were impacted by huge delays in benefits that include tuition and up to $3,000 per month in housing allowances. The issue mostly stems from school officials never properly applying for some courses to be approved for GI Bill funding from the Department of Veterans Affairs, while admitting students with promises that the VA would support their education, an oversight that is becoming a pattern at major universities. \"The school totally dropped the ball here, and no one can give me straight answers,\" Michael Luu, an aerospace engineering Ph.D. student who has spent months at the school unsure how he is going to pay for its tuition and relies on the GI Bill's housing allowance to make ends meet, told Military.com. News of MIT's benefits issues follows a failure at Howard University, another prestigious private university, where a Military.com investigation found that student veterans suffered through at least a year of clerical errors and misfiled paperwork, leaving some on the verge of losing their homes. Read Next: As US Troops and Families Go Hungry, They Don\u2019t Trust the Pentagon for Help The systemic failure at Howard culminated in the District of Columbia State Approving Agency, which oversees GI Bill policy compliance, threatening to cut Howard off from GI Bill funding, which would have left some 235 beneficiaries on campus displaced and likely having to find a new school, and possibly cost the school at least $6.3 million a year in lost money from the benefits. Almost immediately after the Military.com investigation was published, Howard scrambled and was able to keep its status as a GI Bill-approved school. The school official who handled veteran benefits left the job almost immediately after publication of the story. Will Hubbard, vice president for veterans and military policy for Veterans Education Success, a GI Bill advocacy group in Washington, D.C., told Military.com that the MIT and Howard situations are a bad combination of the VA's mismanaged priorities in targeting prestigious institutions instead of rooting out bogus schools -- and the schools themselves failing to adequately manage student veterans. \"They  are just kind of aggressive in areas they shouldn't be on these administrative errors; it's a question of where VA is allocating its sources,\" Hubbard said. \"But these schools that accept GI Bill money but don\u2019t allocate resources to managing that, they're doing something wrong. It's VA being overly aggressive coming into contact with a school's mismanagement; both are wrong.\" Advocates and lawmakers previously focused much of their attention on schools of questionable educational merit that fly under the radar and often rely on GI Bill money to stay afloat. In 2018, the VA inspector general warned the department could waste $2.3 billion in payments to \"ineligible colleges\" through 2023. In the bulk of cases, the payments would go to predatory for-profit universities or fraudulent schools. But MIT and Howard are legitimate schools and offer some of the best-quality higher education in the country. Advocates are not aware of other cases like MIT and Howard but, given the recent issues with those prestigious schools, Hubbard said it's very likely there are other major universities fumbling military scholarships, underscoring the need for student veterans to be cognizant of whether their programs, not just the schools themselves, are VA certified. Military.com spoke to multiple MIT officials, student veterans on campus, and officials with the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education, which acts as the middleman between the VA and schools to approve programs in an effort to curtail fraud and preserve the integrity of the GI Bill. The GI Bill benefit is one of the federal government's largest, and, many argue, most successful entitlement programs. Most sources interviewed had a different understanding of the specifics of the MIT problem and its scope. Issues appear to have started in February, the beginning of the spring semester, when the school did not properly apply for eligibility of its dual-degree Leaders for Global Operations engineering program. The school also has never sought approval for its Ph.D. programs. Yet most students, including those in doctoral programs, interviewed by Military.com did not see problems with their funding until the summer or fall semesters. Schools typically must coordinate with regulators annually for courses to be eligible for student veterans to use military scholarships. \"There were some periods we submitted information, and we didn't receive a response for many months,\" Ian Waitz, the school's vice chancellor, told Military.com, referring to a back-and-forth between the school and state-level GI Bill approving authorities. \"The VA has a set of policies that are designed for very good reasons to stop predatory behavior that require some specifics on what you need to complete a\n\nquestion: What does James Rudisill, a longtime FBI agent and Army veteran, argue regarding the GI Bill benefits?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1116}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

So we need to understand exactly what is needed, go program by program so that our descriptions satisfy VA requirements.\" In addition to the Ph.D. programs never being approved, the state approving agency acting on behalf of the VA yanked MIT's Global Leadership dual-degree program eligibility after an audit of the school's GI Bill compliance was conducted and it was discovered the program should never have been verified because the school never submitted it in its catalog to approving authorities. It is unclear how students were able to use the GI Bill for unapproved programs; it could have been an oversight by the VA until the audit. But Military.com could not confirm specifics on the timeline of events. \"They never asked for approval; we can't approve things if they don't ask,\" an official who oversees GI Bill approval for schools, told Military.com on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. \"When we asked them for the information, they couldn't provide it.\" To protect students from enrolling in schools with uncertified programs, former President Barack Obama signed an executive order in 2012 telling universities that courses must be approved by the VA before enrolling students. \"If there are any shortcomings with respect to that standard which occurred during the pandemic, we will seek to address them expeditiously,\" Waitz said. In the meantime, Waitz said that any of the school's GI Bill beneficiaries whose programs are in limbo or continue to not be approved by education auditors will have their tuition and housing allowance covered by the school. The Global Leadership program was retroactively approved earlier this fall, setting up students to potentially get funds from the VA covering the gap in program approval dating back to the beginning of the year. He added that the school is in the middle of getting doctoral programs certified for GI Bill use. But it's unclear why those programs weren't approved to begin with, which is seemingly rare for schools to not have all of their courses approved. Luu stopped receiving his GI Bill benefits at MIT in September, including his earned scholarship to cover a massive chunk of tuition and about $3,000 per month in a housing allowance, money he relies on heavily for living expenses. \"It has just been silence from the school's end on what the next steps are. It has become a growing frustration, and no one will tell me what the problem is,\" Luu, who served as an infantry officer in the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade, told Military.com. Last month, MIT's aerospace department gave Luu what is effectively an impromptu scholarship of $27,000 to cover tuition costs while the administration figures out how to certify Ph.D. programs. However, Luu said he has not received all the compensation he has earned, and the school's financial services personnel are not sure how that money is supposed to be issued. But Luu said there's no plan for next semester, which begins in February. School officials have been telling him for the better part of the past year his program would be certified, but have not given him a timeline. The problem spurred Luu to file a congressional complaint to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who sits on the Armed Services Committee. Congressional complaints are a means for constituents to contact their senators or House representatives to help resolve issues, often involving federal benefits. Andrew Tresansky, a student in the Global Leadership program, had his spring semester covered by the GI Bill, but the money stopped coming in the summer and he is out roughly $10,000. The program's certification was not done in time for fall, and he paid for schooling with a separate grant and out of pocket, although the VA reimbursed him in early November. The school also paid him some money he lost earlier in the fall semester, but not for what he paid out during the summer. \"I'm saving up for a house, so I was lucky in that respect,\" said Tresansky, who previously served as a naval submarine officer. \"I'm lucky. My wife has a good job; we had a lot saved up. But we weren't planning to spend that money this way.\" Tresansky says he appreciates MIT stepping in, covering some of the lost housing allowance for the fall semester and tuition. However, it is unclear why the school hasn't covered the summer semester or how long it will take the VA to provide back pay to students given the LGO program is now certified. \"MIT has been trying to do the right thing, and VA has been difficult to deal with,\" he said. Some students Military.com spoke to pointed to a lack of a student veterans office on campus, and clear points of contact -- a common staple at most universities -- for those having GI Bill issues. MIT currently has two officials charged with certifying courses, but that staff also fill other roles at the school.

Some students are frustrated that MIT, of all schools, stumbled over military scholarships to begin with. \"You're profiting off the Defense Department,\" Luu said of the school. \"There's a disconnect.\" If you are a beneficiary of any military scholarships such as the GI Bill or National Guard Tuition Assistance and your school has encountered problems certifying your program or any class, please contact steve.beynon@military.com.

The Army veteran and his Chicago lawyer are asking the Supreme Court to take his case, which could help other long-serving vets tap college educational benefits for themselves and their families that they earned under more than one version of the GI Bill. Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times Arguing that he was wrongly denied GI Bill educational benefits, Rudisill is taking his fight to the Supreme Court in a legal quest that his Chicago attorney hopes will open up additional college benefits for himself and others and recognize \u201cwhat veterans have given to this nation.\u201d If the high court agrees to hear his appeal, its decision in the much-watched case could affect 2 million U.S. military veterans who served at least six years and earned educational benefits under more than one version of the GI Bill, a series of federal laws that entitles vets to benefits for their service. Rudisill says the federal Department of Veterans Affairs used what a lower-court ruling in his favor agreed were \u201cabsurd\u201d calculations that shortchanged him on financial support for postgraduate schooling that he had hoped to use to change careers and help other vets. He\u2019s right, former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been of the mind that, when in doubt, always defer to the veteran,\u201d says Hagel, a Vietnam War combat veteran who, as a Republican U.S. senator representing Nebraska, helped marshal bipartisan support for the passage in 2008 of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Hagel says in an interview that the aim of the law was to aid veterans. Asked about Rudisill\u2019s case, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s the veteran who deserves the break here.\u201d Former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is a Vietnam War vet who, as a Republican U.S. senator from Nebraska, helped win passage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Mark Wilson / Getty Images Enacted as a way to help keep people in military service longer and stabilize the nation\u2019s all-volunteer armed forces, the Post-9/11 GI Bill was the first upgrade of the original law in almost 25 years and now accounts for the bulk of GI Bill benefits, according to the Congressional Research Service. Rudisill earned educational benefits under two separate GI Bills: He enlisted in the Army in 2000. After getting out in 2002, he used about 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for college, then returned to the military in 2004 after friends were killed in action. He initially joined the North Carolina National Guard, later becoming a commissioned Army officer, serving five more years on active duty, including two tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He was wounded in suicide-bomb attacks and by roadside bombs. And, as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, he helped save lives by turning back a Taliban assault on a remote outpost while directing medical evacuations under fire. He was awarded the Bronze Star, among other honors, and attained the rank of captain. A wounded James Rudisill when he was medically evacuated in 2005 to Balad Air Base\u2019s combat support hospital in Iraq. Provided After leaving the Army, he joined the FBI, where his work has included investigating ISIS supporters and white supremacists. Under federal law, veterans can use benefits they\u2019ve earned under both the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for a maximum of 48 months of college or other higher education. Having previously used just over 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for his bachelor\u2019s degree, Rudisill figured he had about 22 months of benefits remaining. He planned to tap that number of months from his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to get a divinity degree at Yale University so he could return to the Army as a chaplain and minister to troops. But the VA calculated his remaining benefits differently. The agency figured that, because Rudisill still had 10 months of unused Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits, it would give him only that much, converted to Post-9/11 benefits. And that was all he could get, according to the VA. That would come to a total of 36 months under the two plans \u2014 12 months fewer than the combined maximum of 48 months that he\u2019d counted on. That ruined his chance to go to Yale, to which he\u2019d already been accepted but which he couldn\u2019t afford without the GI Bill money. Rudisill, who lives in Virginia, sued and won twice, but then saw that court victory overturned on appeal. That\u2019s the ruling he wants the Supreme Court to overturn if the court decides to hear his case. Rudisill has been fighting the VA for so long that, now 43, he\u2019s too old to be accepted into the Army chaplain program. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me,\ufffd\n\nquestion: What does James Rudisill, a longtime FBI agent and Army veteran, argue regarding the GI Bill benefits?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Rudisill argues that he was wrongly denied GI Bill educational benefits due to the absurd calculations used by the federal Department of Veterans Affairs.", "usage": 1125}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times One of his lawyers calls Rudisill\u2019s circumstances \u201ca trap for the unwary\u201d that can ensnare all veterans who use part of their Montgomery GI Bill benefits and expect to be able to separately tap Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Rudisill won a victory in 2019 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \u2014 the federal court with exclusive jurisdiction on veterans\u2019 matters \u2014 ruled in his favor, saying Congress never intended to shortchange veterans. The federal government appealed, and Rudisill won again in 2021, when a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with him. But the VA asked for a reconsideration by the full bench of appellate judges. In December, a majority of the full appellate court sided with the government. A VA spokesman won\u2019t comment beyond saying agency officials agree with the appellate court ruling. \u201cIt was immensely disappointing,\u201d Rudisill says. \u201cAt this point, not for myself, but for the millions of veterans who are stymied by this very narrow interpretation of the statute.\u201d Misha Tseytlin, a Chicago partner in the law firm Troutman Pepper, is part of Rudisill\u2019s all-volunteer legal team. The lawyers argue that the VA\u2019s calculations don\u2019t make sense based on the laws themselves and also based on court rulings favoring veterans going back to World War II. That so-called \u201cpro-veteran canon\u201d says that \u201cbecause veterans have given so much to this nation, if there\u2019s any ambiguity, give the vets the benefit of the doubt concerning benefits,\u201d Tseytlin says. Misha Tseytlin, the Chicago lawyer representing James Rudisill in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Pat Nabong / Sun-Times Tim McHugh, a former Army paratrooper who is another lawyer on Rudisill\u2019s team, says Congress\u2019 intent must be considered. \u201cThink about what is the purpose of these programs in the first place,\u201d he says. Hagel \u2014 who was a deputy VA administrator under President Ronald Reagan and Defense secretary under President Barack Obama \u2014 says that when Democrat Jim Webb of Virginia proposed the 2008 law, he enthusiastically agreed to co-sponsor it to help vets readjust to civilian life. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, which took effect in 2009, provides added educational benefits \u2014 including being able to share those benefits with a veteran\u2019s children or spouse \u2014 in exchange for staying on in the military longer. \u201cWe were sending these men and women back into combat for one, two, three, four tours and more,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cYou are counting on these people to go back and back and back.\u201d Of Rudisill\u2019s case, Hagel says: \u201cI hope the Supreme Court takes it up, and I hope they study it very carefully and look at all the factors.\u201d If they do, he says, the pro-veteran canon should tip the scales toward Rudisill and others like him. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed they deserve a little extra edge,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cVets don\u2019t expect anything free. But they do expect some kind of acknowledgement. And it\u2019s an investment. When you educate a veteran, you are making an investment in the country.\u201d Retired Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Petta, who got his undergraduate degree from Southern Illinois University through a Navy program, is in the same position as Rudisill. Petta\u2019s story was included in a friend-of-the-court brief in Rudisill\u2019s case last year. The Boston-area man enlisted in the Navy in 1992, serving as a submarine technician while taking classes from SIU online. He left the Navy in 2000 but rejoined after 9/11. In 2002, he became a Coast Guard officer and later was accepted into a Coast Guard law school program, for which he used just over 33 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits. During two decades in the Coast Guard, he also earned Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, which he never touched. Going by the 48-month maximum, Petta still would have had nearly 15 months of college benefits to transfer to his children. But the VA used the same math that it did with Rudisill, saying Petta had less than three months available \u2014 shorting him of 12 months that\n\nquestion: What does James Rudisill, a longtime FBI agent and Army veteran, argue regarding the GI Bill benefits?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "It hasn't been for years and years now.

After he challenged the VA\u2019s decision, he got a form letter saying his son could get 14 months and 23 days of his benefits. He celebrated \u2014 and then another letter arrived saying his son could get only two months and 23 days. \u201cIt\u2019s a house of mirrors,\u201d Petta says. \u201cI\u2019m not asking anybody to feel bad for me. But what frustrates me is there are service members who are much worse off than I am.\u201d Veterans and their advocates have been closely watching Rudisill\u2019s case. Among them: U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a retired Army lieutenant colonel who flew combat missions in Iraq, was awarded the Purple Heart and was an assistant VA secretary under Obama. Duckworth\u2019s spokeswoman says the senator \u201cbelieves in the veterans canon that, if there is ambiguity in the laws providing benefits, courts should decide cases in a manner that benefits the veterans seeking benefits.\u201d U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth: Give vets the benefit of the doubt in deciding benefits. AP Aniela Szymanski, a Nevada lawyer who specializes in veterans issues, says the December appellate decision in Rudisill\u2019s case glossed over that long tradition of law regarding vets. \u201cIf the court was going to err on any side, it should have been on the side of the veterans,\u201d says Szymanski, who served active duty in the Marine Corps and remains an officer in the Marine Reserves.

On March 30, the California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education officially withdrew GI Bill approval for all coursework offered by the University of Arizona Global Campus, formerly known as Ashford University. The move followed a decision by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education revoking the school\u2019s license to operate in the state. Without that approval, students are unable to use GI Bill benefits to pay for any of the for-profit school\u2019s 90 education programs. In a statement, Department of Veterans Affairs officials said they are \u201cclosely monitoring this situation and notifying impacted GI Bill beneficiaries of CSAAVE\u2019s action and options that may be available to them.\u201d About 3,000 students who were enrolled in coursework at UAGC prior to March 30 will be able to continue receiving tuition and related benefits through the end of their current term. But whether they\u2019ll be able to complete degree programs with the school or at other institutions remains unclear. The school could also get a new operating license approved in a separate state, but that process can take months or years. It is unclear whether officials plan to do that and whether a new license could be approved before the fall semester. Under federal law, VA leaders can restore full GI Bill benefits for students \u201cwhose school has closed or been disapproved,\u201d but only under certain circumstances. VA officials said the UAGC situation does not fall under those specific requirements, although outside advocates have already called for the department to reconsider that interpretation. \u201cVeterans rely on VA\u2019s stamp of approval when choosing a school for their GI Bill benefits,\u201d Jennifer Esparza, legal affairs director at Veterans Education Success, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge VA to put veterans first by embracing the law that protects veterans from deceptive recruiting.\u201d In a separate legal fight last month, a California court fined Ashford University and its former owners more than $22 million in penalties for giving misleading statements to prospective students about their education programs and post-college career prospects. UAGC officials are not liable for those penalties, which are based on actions that occured before its ownership and name change in late 2020. Officials from Veterans Education Success argue that the VA could terminate the school\u2019s GI Bill eligibility based on that court ruling, thereby making students eligible for reinstatement of their GI Bill benefits. But for now, VA officials said they are not considering that step. VA paid more than $31 million in GI Bill benefits to UAGC in fiscal 2020, according to department records. Students with questions about GI Bill payments or other financial support from the department can contact VA\u2019s Education Call Center at 888-442-4551. Update: In a statement provided to Military Times a day after publication of this story, UAGC officials said they hope to obtain a new operating license in Arizona and regain eligibility for GI Bill funds as soon as possible. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to keep students in the classroom as we await the formal approval in Arizona,\u201d UAGC President Paul Pastorek said. \u201cThis is an unacceptable situation for our students and we have already made immediate adjustments such that UAGC is providing grant funds to all affected students so that their education is not impacted by this temporary lapse.\u201d Leo covers Congress, Veterans Affairs and the White House for Military Times.

There are 104 GI Bill beneficiaries on MIT's campus, worth some $3 million in tuition to the university. At least 20 were impacted by huge delays in benefits that include tuition and up to $3,000 per month in housing allowances. The issue mostly stems from school officials never properly applying for some courses to be approved for GI Bill funding from the Department of Veterans Affairs, while admitting students with promises that the VA would support their education, an oversight that is becoming a pattern at major universities. \"The school totally dropped the ball here, and no one can give me straight answers,\" Michael Luu, an aerospace engineering Ph.D. student who has spent months at the school unsure how he is going to pay for its tuition and relies on the GI Bill's housing allowance to make ends meet, told Military.com. News of MIT's benefits issues follows a failure at Howard University, another prestigious private university, where a Military.com investigation found that student veterans suffered through at least a year of clerical errors and misfiled paperwork, leaving some on the verge of losing their homes. Read Next: As US Troops and Families Go Hungry, They Don\u2019t Trust the Pentagon for Help The systemic failure at Howard culminated in the District of Columbia State Approving Agency, which oversees GI Bill policy compliance, threatening to cut Howard off from GI Bill funding, which would have left some 235 beneficiaries on campus displaced and likely having to find a new school, and possibly cost the school at least $6.3 million a year in lost money from the benefits. Almost immediately after the Military.com investigation was published, Howard scrambled and was able to keep its status as a GI Bill-approved school. The school official who handled veteran benefits left the job almost immediately after publication of the story. Will Hubbard, vice president for veterans and military policy for Veterans Education Success, a GI Bill advocacy group in Washington, D.C., told Military.com that the MIT and Howard situations are a bad combination of the VA's mismanaged priorities in targeting prestigious institutions instead of rooting out bogus schools -- and the schools themselves failing to adequately manage student veterans. \"They  are just kind of aggressive in areas they shouldn't be on these administrative errors; it's a question of where VA is allocating its sources,\" Hubbard said. \"But these schools that accept GI Bill money but don\u2019t allocate resources to managing that, they're doing something wrong. It's VA being overly aggressive coming into contact with a school's mismanagement; both are wrong.\" Advocates and lawmakers previously focused much of their attention on schools of questionable educational merit that fly under the radar and often rely on GI Bill money to stay afloat. In 2018, the VA inspector general warned the department could waste $2.3 billion in payments to \"ineligible colleges\" through 2023. In the bulk of cases, the payments would go to predatory for-profit universities or fraudulent schools. But MIT and Howard are legitimate schools and offer some of the best-quality higher education in the country. Advocates are not aware of other cases like MIT and Howard but, given the recent issues with those prestigious schools, Hubbard said it's very likely there are other major universities fumbling military scholarships, underscoring the need for student veterans to be cognizant of whether their programs, not just the schools themselves, are VA certified. Military.com spoke to multiple MIT officials, student veterans on campus, and officials with the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education, which acts as the middleman between the VA and schools to approve programs in an effort to curtail fraud and preserve the integrity of the GI Bill. The GI Bill benefit is one of the federal government's largest, and, many argue, most successful entitlement programs. Most sources interviewed had a different understanding of the specifics of the MIT problem and its scope. Issues appear to have started in February, the beginning of the spring semester, when the school did not properly apply for eligibility of its dual-degree Leaders for Global Operations engineering program. The school also has never sought approval for its Ph.D. programs. Yet most students, including those in doctoral programs, interviewed by Military.com did not see problems with their funding until the summer or fall semesters. Schools typically must coordinate with regulators annually for courses to be eligible for student veterans to use military scholarships. \"There were some periods we submitted information, and we didn't receive a response for many months,\" Ian Waitz, the school's vice chancellor, told Military.com, referring to a back-and-forth between the school and state-level GI Bill approving authorities. \"The VA has a set of policies that are designed for very good reasons to stop predatory behavior that require some specifics on what you need to complete a\n\nquestion: How many U.S. military veterans could be affected by James Rudisill's case?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "20 veteran were impacted by James Rudisill's case.", "usage": 1122}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

So we need to understand exactly what is needed, go program by program so that our descriptions satisfy VA requirements.\" In addition to the Ph.D. programs never being approved, the state approving agency acting on behalf of the VA yanked MIT's Global Leadership dual-degree program eligibility after an audit of the school's GI Bill compliance was conducted and it was discovered the program should never have been verified because the school never submitted it in its catalog to approving authorities. It is unclear how students were able to use the GI Bill for unapproved programs; it could have been an oversight by the VA until the audit. But Military.com could not confirm specifics on the timeline of events. \"They never asked for approval; we can't approve things if they don't ask,\" an official who oversees GI Bill approval for schools, told Military.com on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. \"When we asked them for the information, they couldn't provide it.\" To protect students from enrolling in schools with uncertified programs, former President Barack Obama signed an executive order in 2012 telling universities that courses must be approved by the VA before enrolling students. \"If there are any shortcomings with respect to that standard which occurred during the pandemic, we will seek to address them expeditiously,\" Waitz said. In the meantime, Waitz said that any of the school's GI Bill beneficiaries whose programs are in limbo or continue to not be approved by education auditors will have their tuition and housing allowance covered by the school. The Global Leadership program was retroactively approved earlier this fall, setting up students to potentially get funds from the VA covering the gap in program approval dating back to the beginning of the year. He added that the school is in the middle of getting doctoral programs certified for GI Bill use. But it's unclear why those programs weren't approved to begin with, which is seemingly rare for schools to not have all of their courses approved. Luu stopped receiving his GI Bill benefits at MIT in September, including his earned scholarship to cover a massive chunk of tuition and about $3,000 per month in a housing allowance, money he relies on heavily for living expenses. \"It has just been silence from the school's end on what the next steps are. It has become a growing frustration, and no one will tell me what the problem is,\" Luu, who served as an infantry officer in the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade, told Military.com. Last month, MIT's aerospace department gave Luu what is effectively an impromptu scholarship of $27,000 to cover tuition costs while the administration figures out how to certify Ph.D. programs. However, Luu said he has not received all the compensation he has earned, and the school's financial services personnel are not sure how that money is supposed to be issued. But Luu said there's no plan for next semester, which begins in February. School officials have been telling him for the better part of the past year his program would be certified, but have not given him a timeline. The problem spurred Luu to file a congressional complaint to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who sits on the Armed Services Committee. Congressional complaints are a means for constituents to contact their senators or House representatives to help resolve issues, often involving federal benefits. Andrew Tresansky, a student in the Global Leadership program, had his spring semester covered by the GI Bill, but the money stopped coming in the summer and he is out roughly $10,000. The program's certification was not done in time for fall, and he paid for schooling with a separate grant and out of pocket, although the VA reimbursed him in early November. The school also paid him some money he lost earlier in the fall semester, but not for what he paid out during the summer. \"I'm saving up for a house, so I was lucky in that respect,\" said Tresansky, who previously served as a naval submarine officer. \"I'm lucky. My wife has a good job; we had a lot saved up. But we weren't planning to spend that money this way.\" Tresansky says he appreciates MIT stepping in, covering some of the lost housing allowance for the fall semester and tuition. However, it is unclear why the school hasn't covered the summer semester or how long it will take the VA to provide back pay to students given the LGO program is now certified. \"MIT has been trying to do the right thing, and VA has been difficult to deal with,\" he said. Some students Military.com spoke to pointed to a lack of a student veterans office on campus, and clear points of contact -- a common staple at most universities -- for those having GI Bill issues. MIT currently has two officials charged with certifying courses, but that staff also fill other roles at the school.

Some students are frustrated that MIT, of all schools, stumbled over military scholarships to begin with. \"You're profiting off the Defense Department,\" Luu said of the school. \"There's a disconnect.\" If you are a beneficiary of any military scholarships such as the GI Bill or National Guard Tuition Assistance and your school has encountered problems certifying your program or any class, please contact steve.beynon@military.com.

The Army veteran and his Chicago lawyer are asking the Supreme Court to take his case, which could help other long-serving vets tap college educational benefits for themselves and their families that they earned under more than one version of the GI Bill. Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times Arguing that he was wrongly denied GI Bill educational benefits, Rudisill is taking his fight to the Supreme Court in a legal quest that his Chicago attorney hopes will open up additional college benefits for himself and others and recognize \u201cwhat veterans have given to this nation.\u201d If the high court agrees to hear his appeal, its decision in the much-watched case could affect 2 million U.S. military veterans who served at least six years and earned educational benefits under more than one version of the GI Bill, a series of federal laws that entitles vets to benefits for their service. Rudisill says the federal Department of Veterans Affairs used what a lower-court ruling in his favor agreed were \u201cabsurd\u201d calculations that shortchanged him on financial support for postgraduate schooling that he had hoped to use to change careers and help other vets. He\u2019s right, former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been of the mind that, when in doubt, always defer to the veteran,\u201d says Hagel, a Vietnam War combat veteran who, as a Republican U.S. senator representing Nebraska, helped marshal bipartisan support for the passage in 2008 of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Hagel says in an interview that the aim of the law was to aid veterans. Asked about Rudisill\u2019s case, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s the veteran who deserves the break here.\u201d Former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is a Vietnam War vet who, as a Republican U.S. senator from Nebraska, helped win passage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Mark Wilson / Getty Images Enacted as a way to help keep people in military service longer and stabilize the nation\u2019s all-volunteer armed forces, the Post-9/11 GI Bill was the first upgrade of the original law in almost 25 years and now accounts for the bulk of GI Bill benefits, according to the Congressional Research Service. Rudisill earned educational benefits under two separate GI Bills: He enlisted in the Army in 2000. After getting out in 2002, he used about 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for college, then returned to the military in 2004 after friends were killed in action. He initially joined the North Carolina National Guard, later becoming a commissioned Army officer, serving five more years on active duty, including two tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He was wounded in suicide-bomb attacks and by roadside bombs. And, as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, he helped save lives by turning back a Taliban assault on a remote outpost while directing medical evacuations under fire. He was awarded the Bronze Star, among other honors, and attained the rank of captain. A wounded James Rudisill when he was medically evacuated in 2005 to Balad Air Base\u2019s combat support hospital in Iraq. Provided After leaving the Army, he joined the FBI, where his work has included investigating ISIS supporters and white supremacists. Under federal law, veterans can use benefits they\u2019ve earned under both the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for a maximum of 48 months of college or other higher education. Having previously used just over 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for his bachelor\u2019s degree, Rudisill figured he had about 22 months of benefits remaining. He planned to tap that number of months from his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to get a divinity degree at Yale University so he could return to the Army as a chaplain and minister to troops. But the VA calculated his remaining benefits differently. The agency figured that, because Rudisill still had 10 months of unused Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits, it would give him only that much, converted to Post-9/11 benefits. And that was all he could get, according to the VA. That would come to a total of 36 months under the two plans \u2014 12 months fewer than the combined maximum of 48 months that he\u2019d counted on. That ruined his chance to go to Yale, to which he\u2019d already been accepted but which he couldn\u2019t afford without the GI Bill money. Rudisill, who lives in Virginia, sued and won twice, but then saw that court victory overturned on appeal. That\u2019s the ruling he wants the Supreme Court to overturn if the court decides to hear his case. Rudisill has been fighting the VA for so long that, now 43, he\u2019s too old to be accepted into the Army chaplain program. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me,\ufffd\n\nquestion: How many U.S. military veterans could be affected by James Rudisill's case?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "2 million U.S. military veterans", "usage": 1100}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times One of his lawyers calls Rudisill\u2019s circumstances \u201ca trap for the unwary\u201d that can ensnare all veterans who use part of their Montgomery GI Bill benefits and expect to be able to separately tap Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Rudisill won a victory in 2019 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \u2014 the federal court with exclusive jurisdiction on veterans\u2019 matters \u2014 ruled in his favor, saying Congress never intended to shortchange veterans. The federal government appealed, and Rudisill won again in 2021, when a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with him. But the VA asked for a reconsideration by the full bench of appellate judges. In December, a majority of the full appellate court sided with the government. A VA spokesman won\u2019t comment beyond saying agency officials agree with the appellate court ruling. \u201cIt was immensely disappointing,\u201d Rudisill says. \u201cAt this point, not for myself, but for the millions of veterans who are stymied by this very narrow interpretation of the statute.\u201d Misha Tseytlin, a Chicago partner in the law firm Troutman Pepper, is part of Rudisill\u2019s all-volunteer legal team. The lawyers argue that the VA\u2019s calculations don\u2019t make sense based on the laws themselves and also based on court rulings favoring veterans going back to World War II. That so-called \u201cpro-veteran canon\u201d says that \u201cbecause veterans have given so much to this nation, if there\u2019s any ambiguity, give the vets the benefit of the doubt concerning benefits,\u201d Tseytlin says. Misha Tseytlin, the Chicago lawyer representing James Rudisill in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Pat Nabong / Sun-Times Tim McHugh, a former Army paratrooper who is another lawyer on Rudisill\u2019s team, says Congress\u2019 intent must be considered. \u201cThink about what is the purpose of these programs in the first place,\u201d he says. Hagel \u2014 who was a deputy VA administrator under President Ronald Reagan and Defense secretary under President Barack Obama \u2014 says that when Democrat Jim Webb of Virginia proposed the 2008 law, he enthusiastically agreed to co-sponsor it to help vets readjust to civilian life. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, which took effect in 2009, provides added educational benefits \u2014 including being able to share those benefits with a veteran\u2019s children or spouse \u2014 in exchange for staying on in the military longer. \u201cWe were sending these men and women back into combat for one, two, three, four tours and more,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cYou are counting on these people to go back and back and back.\u201d Of Rudisill\u2019s case, Hagel says: \u201cI hope the Supreme Court takes it up, and I hope they study it very carefully and look at all the factors.\u201d If they do, he says, the pro-veteran canon should tip the scales toward Rudisill and others like him. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed they deserve a little extra edge,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cVets don\u2019t expect anything free. But they do expect some kind of acknowledgement. And it\u2019s an investment. When you educate a veteran, you are making an investment in the country.\u201d Retired Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Petta, who got his undergraduate degree from Southern Illinois University through a Navy program, is in the same position as Rudisill. Petta\u2019s story was included in a friend-of-the-court brief in Rudisill\u2019s case last year. The Boston-area man enlisted in the Navy in 1992, serving as a submarine technician while taking classes from SIU online. He left the Navy in 2000 but rejoined after 9/11. In 2002, he became a Coast Guard officer and later was accepted into a Coast Guard law school program, for which he used just over 33 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits. During two decades in the Coast Guard, he also earned Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, which he never touched. Going by the 48-month maximum, Petta still would have had nearly 15 months of college benefits to transfer to his children. But the VA used the same math that it did with Rudisill, saying Petta had less than three months available \u2014 shorting him of 12 months that\n\nquestion: How many U.S. military veterans could be affected by James Rudisill's case?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "millions", "usage": 1060}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

After he challenged the VA\u2019s decision, he got a form letter saying his son could get 14 months and 23 days of his benefits. He celebrated \u2014 and then another letter arrived saying his son could get only two months and 23 days. \u201cIt\u2019s a house of mirrors,\u201d Petta says. \u201cI\u2019m not asking anybody to feel bad for me. But what frustrates me is there are service members who are much worse off than I am.\u201d Veterans and their advocates have been closely watching Rudisill\u2019s case. Among them: U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a retired Army lieutenant colonel who flew combat missions in Iraq, was awarded the Purple Heart and was an assistant VA secretary under Obama. Duckworth\u2019s spokeswoman says the senator \u201cbelieves in the veterans canon that, if there is ambiguity in the laws providing benefits, courts should decide cases in a manner that benefits the veterans seeking benefits.\u201d U.S. Sen.

On March 30, the California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education officially withdrew GI Bill approval for all coursework offered by the University of Arizona Global Campus, formerly known as Ashford University. The move followed a decision by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education revoking the school\u2019s license to operate in the state. Without that approval, students are unable to use GI Bill benefits to pay for any of the for-profit school\u2019s 90 education programs. In a statement, Department of Veterans Affairs officials said they are \u201cclosely monitoring this situation and notifying impacted GI Bill beneficiaries of CSAAVE\u2019s action and options that may be available to them.\u201d About 3,000 students who were enrolled in coursework at UAGC prior to March 30 will be able to continue receiving tuition and related benefits through the end of their current term. But whether they\u2019ll be able to complete degree programs with the school or at other institutions remains unclear. The school could also get a new operating license approved in a separate state, but that process can take months or years. It is unclear whether officials plan to do that and whether a new license could be approved before the fall semester. Under federal law, VA leaders can restore full GI Bill benefits for students \u201cwhose school has closed or been disapproved,\u201d but only under certain circumstances. VA officials said the UAGC situation does not fall under those specific requirements, although outside advocates have already called for the department to reconsider that interpretation. \u201cVeterans rely on VA\u2019s stamp of approval when choosing a school for their GI Bill benefits,\u201d Jennifer Esparza, legal affairs director at Veterans Education Success, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge VA to put veterans first by embracing the law that protects veterans from deceptive recruiting.\u201d In a separate legal fight last month, a California court fined Ashford University and its former owners more than $22 million in penalties for giving misleading statements to prospective students about their education programs and post-college career prospects. UAGC officials are not liable for those penalties, which are based on actions that occured before its ownership and name change in late 2020. Officials from Veterans Education Success argue that the VA could terminate the school\u2019s GI Bill eligibility based on that court ruling, thereby making students eligible for reinstatement of their GI Bill benefits. But for now, VA officials said they are not considering that step. VA paid more than $31 million in GI Bill benefits to UAGC in fiscal 2020, according to department records. Students with questions about GI Bill payments or other financial support from the department can contact VA\u2019s Education Call Center at 888-442-4551. Update: In a statement provided to Military Times a day after publication of this story, UAGC officials said they hope to obtain a new operating license in Arizona and regain eligibility for GI Bill funds as soon as possible. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to keep students in the classroom as we await the formal approval in Arizona,\u201d UAGC President Paul Pastorek said. \u201cThis is an unacceptable situation for our students and we have already made immediate adjustments such that UAGC is providing grant funds to all affected students so that their education is not impacted by this temporary lapse.\u201d Leo covers Congress, Veterans Affairs and the White House for Military Times.

There are 104 GI Bill beneficiaries on MIT's campus, worth some $3 million in tuition to the university. At least 20 were impacted by huge delays in benefits that include tuition and up to $3,000 per month in housing allowances. The issue mostly stems from school officials never properly applying for some courses to be approved for GI Bill funding from the Department of Veterans Affairs, while admitting students with promises that the VA would support their education, an oversight that is becoming a pattern at major universities. \"The school totally dropped the ball here, and no one can give me straight answers,\" Michael Luu, an aerospace engineering Ph.D. student who has spent months at the school unsure how he is going to pay for its tuition and relies on the GI Bill's housing allowance to make ends meet, told Military.com. News of MIT's benefits issues follows a failure at Howard University, another prestigious private university, where a Military.com investigation found that student veterans suffered through at least a year of clerical errors and misfiled paperwork, leaving some on the verge of losing their homes. Read Next: As US Troops and Families Go Hungry, They Don\u2019t Trust the Pentagon for Help The systemic failure at Howard culminated in the District of Columbia State Approving Agency, which oversees GI Bill policy compliance, threatening to cut Howard off from GI Bill funding, which would have left some 235 beneficiaries on campus displaced and likely having to find a new school, and possibly cost the school at least $6.3 million a year in lost money from the benefits. Almost immediately after the Military.com investigation was published, Howard scrambled and was able to keep its status as a GI Bill-approved school. The school official who handled veteran benefits left the job almost immediately after publication of the story. Will Hubbard, vice president for veterans and military policy for Veterans Education Success, a GI Bill advocacy group in Washington, D.C., told Military.com that the MIT and Howard situations are a bad combination of the VA's mismanaged priorities in targeting prestigious institutions instead of rooting out bogus schools -- and the schools themselves failing to adequately manage student veterans. \"They  are just kind of aggressive in areas they shouldn't be on these administrative errors; it's a question of where VA is allocating its sources,\" Hubbard said. \"But these schools that accept GI Bill money but don\u2019t allocate resources to managing that, they're doing something wrong. It's VA being overly aggressive coming into contact with a school's mismanagement; both are wrong.\" Advocates and lawmakers previously focused much of their attention on schools of questionable educational merit that fly under the radar and often rely on GI Bill money to stay afloat. In 2018, the VA inspector general warned the department could waste $2.3 billion in payments to \"ineligible colleges\" through 2023. In the bulk of cases, the payments would go to predatory for-profit universities or fraudulent schools. But MIT and Howard are legitimate schools and offer some of the best-quality higher education in the country. Advocates are not aware of other cases like MIT and Howard but, given the recent issues with those prestigious schools, Hubbard said it's very likely there are other major universities fumbling military scholarships, underscoring the need for student veterans to be cognizant of whether their programs, not just the schools themselves, are VA certified. Military.com spoke to multiple MIT officials, student veterans on campus, and officials with the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education, which acts as the middleman between the VA and schools to approve programs in an effort to curtail fraud and preserve the integrity of the GI Bill. The GI Bill benefit is one of the federal government's largest, and, many argue, most successful entitlement programs. Most sources interviewed had a different understanding of the specifics of the MIT problem and its scope. Issues appear to have started in February, the beginning of the spring semester, when the school did not properly apply for eligibility of its dual-degree Leaders for Global Operations engineering program. The school also has never sought approval for its Ph.D. programs. Yet most students, including those in doctoral programs, interviewed by Military.com did not see problems with their funding until the summer or fall semesters. Schools typically must coordinate with regulators annually for courses to be eligible for student veterans to use military scholarships. \"There were some periods we submitted information, and we didn't receive a response for many months,\" Ian Waitz, the school's vice chancellor, told Military.com, referring to a back-and-forth between the school and state-level GI Bill approving authorities. \"The VA has a set of policies that are designed for very good reasons to stop predatory behavior that require some specifics on what you need to complete a\n\nquestion: What issues have there been with the GI Bill benefits for student veterans?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Delays in benefits, losing eligibility for programs, lack of proper approval for courses.", "usage": 1123}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

So we need to understand exactly what is needed, go program by program so that our descriptions satisfy VA requirements.\" In addition to the Ph.D. programs never being approved, the state approving agency acting on behalf of the VA yanked MIT's Global Leadership dual-degree program eligibility after an audit of the school's GI Bill compliance was conducted and it was discovered the program should never have been verified because the school never submitted it in its catalog to approving authorities. It is unclear how students were able to use the GI Bill for unapproved programs; it could have been an oversight by the VA until the audit. But Military.com could not confirm specifics on the timeline of events. \"They never asked for approval; we can't approve things if they don't ask,\" an official who oversees GI Bill approval for schools, told Military.com on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. \"When we asked them for the information, they couldn't provide it.\" To protect students from enrolling in schools with uncertified programs, former President Barack Obama signed an executive order in 2012 telling universities that courses must be approved by the VA before enrolling students. \"If there are any shortcomings with respect to that standard which occurred during the pandemic, we will seek to address them expeditiously,\" Waitz said. In the meantime, Waitz said that any of the school's GI Bill beneficiaries whose programs are in limbo or continue to not be approved by education auditors will have their tuition and housing allowance covered by the school. The Global Leadership program was retroactively approved earlier this fall, setting up students to potentially get funds from the VA covering the gap in program approval dating back to the beginning of the year. He added that the school is in the middle of getting doctoral programs certified for GI Bill use. But it's unclear why those programs weren't approved to begin with, which is seemingly rare for schools to not have all of their courses approved. Luu stopped receiving his GI Bill benefits at MIT in September, including his earned scholarship to cover a massive chunk of tuition and about $3,000 per month in a housing allowance, money he relies on heavily for living expenses. \"It has just been silence from the school's end on what the next steps are. It has become a growing frustration, and no one will tell me what the problem is,\" Luu, who served as an infantry officer in the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade, told Military.com. Last month, MIT's aerospace department gave Luu what is effectively an impromptu scholarship of $27,000 to cover tuition costs while the administration figures out how to certify Ph.D. programs. However, Luu said he has not received all the compensation he has earned, and the school's financial services personnel are not sure how that money is supposed to be issued. But Luu said there's no plan for next semester, which begins in February. School officials have been telling him for the better part of the past year his program would be certified, but have not given him a timeline. The problem spurred Luu to file a congressional complaint to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who sits on the Armed Services Committee. Congressional complaints are a means for constituents to contact their senators or House representatives to help resolve issues, often involving federal benefits. Andrew Tresansky, a student in the Global Leadership program, had his spring semester covered by the GI Bill, but the money stopped coming in the summer and he is out roughly $10,000. The program's certification was not done in time for fall, and he paid for schooling with a separate grant and out of pocket, although the VA reimbursed him in early November. The school also paid him some money he lost earlier in the fall semester, but not for what he paid out during the summer. \"I'm saving up for a house, so I was lucky in that respect,\" said Tresansky, who previously served as a naval submarine officer. \"I'm lucky. My wife has a good job; we had a lot saved up. But we weren't planning to spend that money this way.\" Tresansky says he appreciates MIT stepping in, covering some of the lost housing allowance for the fall semester and tuition. However, it is unclear why the school hasn't covered the summer semester or how long it will take the VA to provide back pay to students given the LGO program is now certified. \"MIT has been trying to do the right thing, and VA has been difficult to deal with,\" he said. Some students Military.com spoke to pointed to a lack of a student veterans office on campus, and clear points of contact -- a common staple at most universities -- for those having GI Bill issues. MIT currently has two officials charged with certifying courses, but that staff also fill other roles at the school.

Some students are frustrated that MIT, of all schools, stumbled over military scholarships to begin with. \"You're profiting off the Defense Department,\" Luu said of the school. \"There's a disconnect.\" If you are a beneficiary of any military scholarships such as the GI Bill or National Guard Tuition Assistance and your school has encountered problems certifying your program or any class, please contact steve.beynon@military.com.

The Army veteran and his Chicago lawyer are asking the Supreme Court to take his case, which could help other long-serving vets tap college educational benefits for themselves and their families that they earned under more than one version of the GI Bill. Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times Arguing that he was wrongly denied GI Bill educational benefits, Rudisill is taking his fight to the Supreme Court in a legal quest that his Chicago attorney hopes will open up additional college benefits for himself and others and recognize \u201cwhat veterans have given to this nation.\u201d If the high court agrees to hear his appeal, its decision in the much-watched case could affect 2 million U.S. military veterans who served at least six years and earned educational benefits under more than one version of the GI Bill, a series of federal laws that entitles vets to benefits for their service. Rudisill says the federal Department of Veterans Affairs used what a lower-court ruling in his favor agreed were \u201cabsurd\u201d calculations that shortchanged him on financial support for postgraduate schooling that he had hoped to use to change careers and help other vets. He\u2019s right, former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been of the mind that, when in doubt, always defer to the veteran,\u201d says Hagel, a Vietnam War combat veteran who, as a Republican U.S. senator representing Nebraska, helped marshal bipartisan support for the passage in 2008 of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Hagel says in an interview that the aim of the law was to aid veterans. Asked about Rudisill\u2019s case, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s the veteran who deserves the break here.\u201d Former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is a Vietnam War vet who, as a Republican U.S. senator from Nebraska, helped win passage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Mark Wilson / Getty Images Enacted as a way to help keep people in military service longer and stabilize the nation\u2019s all-volunteer armed forces, the Post-9/11 GI Bill was the first upgrade of the original law in almost 25 years and now accounts for the bulk of GI Bill benefits, according to the Congressional Research Service. Rudisill earned educational benefits under two separate GI Bills: He enlisted in the Army in 2000. After getting out in 2002, he used about 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for college, then returned to the military in 2004 after friends were killed in action. He initially joined the North Carolina National Guard, later becoming a commissioned Army officer, serving five more years on active duty, including two tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He was wounded in suicide-bomb attacks and by roadside bombs. And, as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, he helped save lives by turning back a Taliban assault on a remote outpost while directing medical evacuations under fire. He was awarded the Bronze Star, among other honors, and attained the rank of captain. A wounded James Rudisill when he was medically evacuated in 2005 to Balad Air Base\u2019s combat support hospital in Iraq. Provided After leaving the Army, he joined the FBI, where his work has included investigating ISIS supporters and white supremacists. Under federal law, veterans can use benefits they\u2019ve earned under both the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for a maximum of 48 months of college or other higher education. Having previously used just over 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for his bachelor\u2019s degree, Rudisill figured he had about 22 months of benefits remaining. He planned to tap that number of months from his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to get a divinity degree at Yale University so he could return to the Army as a chaplain and minister to troops. But the VA calculated his remaining benefits differently. The agency figured that, because Rudisill still had 10 months of unused Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits, it would give him only that much, converted to Post-9/11 benefits. And that was all he could get, according to the VA. That would come to a total of 36 months under the two plans \u2014 12 months fewer than the combined maximum of 48 months that he\u2019d counted on. That ruined his chance to go to Yale, to which he\u2019d already been accepted but which he couldn\u2019t afford without the GI Bill money. Rudisill, who lives in Virginia, sued and won twice, but then saw that court victory overturned on appeal. That\u2019s the ruling he wants the Supreme Court to overturn if the court decides to hear his case. Rudisill has been fighting the VA for so long that, now 43, he\u2019s too old to be accepted into the Army chaplain program. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me,\ufffd\n\nquestion: What issues have there been with the GI Bill benefits for student veterans?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "How the VA calculated his remaining benefits differently from what Rudisill was promised by the VA.", "usage": 1108}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Rudisill won a victory in 2019 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \u2014 the federal court with exclusive jurisdiction on veterans\u2019 matters \u2014 ruled in his favor, saying Congress never intended to shortchange veterans. The federal government appealed, and Rudisill won again in 2021, when a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with him. But the VA asked for a reconsideration by the full bench of appellate judges. In December, a majority of the full appellate court sided with the government. A VA spokesman won\u2019t comment beyond saying agency officials agree with the appellate court ruling. \u201cIt was immensely disappointing,\u201d Rudisill says. \u201cAt this point, not for myself, but for the millions of veterans who are stymied by this very narrow interpretation of the statute.\u201d Misha Tseytlin, a Chicago partner in the law firm Troutman Pepper, is part of Rudisill\u2019s all-volunteer legal team. The lawyers argue that the VA\u2019s calculations don\u2019t make sense based on the laws themselves and also based on court rulings favoring veterans going back to World War II. That so-called \u201cpro-veteran canon\u201d says that \u201cbecause veterans have given so much to this nation, if there\u2019s any ambiguity, give the vets the benefit of the doubt concerning benefits,\u201d Tseytlin says. Misha Tseytlin, the Chicago lawyer representing James Rudisill in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Pat Nabong / Sun-Times Tim McHugh, a former Army paratrooper who is another lawyer on Rudisill\u2019s team, says Congress\u2019 intent must be considered. \u201cThink about what is the purpose of these programs in the first place,\u201d he says. Hagel \u2014 who was a deputy VA administrator under President Ronald Reagan and Defense secretary under President Barack Obama \u2014 says that when Democrat Jim Webb of Virginia proposed the 2008 law, he enthusiastically agreed to co-sponsor it to help vets readjust to civilian life. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, which took effect in 2009, provides added educational benefits \u2014 including being able to share those benefits with a veteran\u2019s children or spouse \u2014 in exchange for staying on in the military longer. \u201cWe were sending these men and women back into combat for one, two, three, four tours and more,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cYou are counting on these people to go back and back and back.\u201d Of Rudisill\u2019s case, Hagel says: \u201cI hope the Supreme Court takes it up, and I hope they study it very carefully and look at all the factors.\u201d If they do, he says, the pro-veteran canon should tip the scales toward Rudisill and others like him. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed they deserve a little extra edge,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cVets don\u2019t expect anything free. But they do expect some kind of acknowledgement. And it\u2019s an investment. When you educate a veteran, you are making an investment in the country.\u201d Retired Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Petta, who got his undergraduate degree from Southern Illinois University through a Navy program, is in the same position as Rudisill. Petta\u2019s story was included in a friend-of-the-court brief in Rudisill\u2019s case last year. The Boston-area man enlisted in the Navy in 1992, serving as a submarine technician while taking classes from SIU online. He left the Navy in 2000 but rejoined after 9/11. In 2002, he became a Coast Guard officer and later was accepted into a Coast Guard law school program, for which he used just over 33 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits. During two decades in the Coast Guard, he also earned Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, which he never touched. Going by the 48-month maximum, Petta still would have had nearly 15 months of college benefits to transfer to his children. But the VA used the same math that it did with Rudisill, saying Petta had less than three months available \u2014 shorting him of 12 months that\n\nquestion: What issues have there been with the GI Bill benefits for student veterans?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The federal court ruled against veterans regarding GI Bill benefits.", "usage": 1065}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

After he challenged the VA\u2019s decision, he got a form letter saying his son could get 14 months and 23 days of his benefits. He celebrated \u2014 and then another letter arrived saying his son could get only two months and 23 days. \u201cIt\u2019s a house of mirrors,\u201d Petta says. \u201cI\u2019m not asking anybody to feel bad for me. But what frustrates me is there are service members who are much worse off than I am.\u201d Veterans and their advocates have been closely watching Rudisill\u2019s case. Among them: U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a retired Army lieutenant colonel who flew combat missions in Iraq, was awarded the Purple Heart and was an assistant VA secretary under Obama. Duckworth\u2019s spokeswoman says the senator \u201cbelieves in the veterans canon that, if there is ambiguity in the laws providing benefits, courts should decide cases in a manner that benefits the veterans seeking benefits.\u201d U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth: Give vets the benefit of the doubt in deciding benefits. AP Aniela Szymanski, a Nevada lawyer who specializes in veterans issues, says the December appellate decision in Rudisill\u2019s case glossed over that long tradition of law regarding vets. \u201cIf the court was going to err on any side, it should have been on the side of the veterans,\u201d says Szymanski, who served active duty in the Marine Corps and remains an officer in the Marine Reserves.

On March 30, the California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education officially withdrew GI Bill approval for all coursework offered by the University of Arizona Global Campus, formerly known as Ashford University. The move followed a decision by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education revoking the school\u2019s license to operate in the state. Without that approval, students are unable to use GI Bill benefits to pay for any of the for-profit school\u2019s 90 education programs. In a statement, Department of Veterans Affairs officials said they are \u201cclosely monitoring this situation and notifying impacted GI Bill beneficiaries of CSAAVE\u2019s action and options that may be available to them.\u201d About 3,000 students who were enrolled in coursework at UAGC prior to March 30 will be able to continue receiving tuition and related benefits through the end of their current term. But whether they\u2019ll be able to complete degree programs with the school or at other institutions remains unclear. The school could also get a new operating license approved in a separate state, but that process can take months or years. It is unclear whether officials plan to do that and whether a new license could be approved before the fall semester. Under federal law, VA leaders can restore full GI Bill benefits for students \u201cwhose school has closed or been disapproved,\u201d but only under certain circumstances. VA officials said the UAGC situation does not fall under those specific requirements, although outside advocates have already called for the department to reconsider that interpretation. \u201cVeterans rely on VA\u2019s stamp of approval when choosing a school for their GI Bill benefits,\u201d Jennifer Esparza, legal affairs director at Veterans Education Success, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge VA to put veterans first by embracing the law that protects veterans from deceptive recruiting.\u201d In a separate legal fight last month, a California court fined Ashford University and its former owners more than $22 million in penalties for giving misleading statements to prospective students about their education programs and post-college career prospects. UAGC officials are not liable for those penalties, which are based on actions that occured before its ownership and name change in late 2020. Officials from Veterans Education Success argue that the VA could terminate the school\u2019s GI Bill eligibility based on that court ruling, thereby making students eligible for reinstatement of their GI Bill benefits. But for now, VA officials said they are not considering that step. VA paid more than $31 million in GI Bill benefits to UAGC in fiscal 2020, according to department records. Students with questions about GI Bill payments or other financial support from the department can contact VA\u2019s Education Call Center at 888-442-4551. Update: In a statement provided to Military Times a day after publication of this story, UAGC officials said they hope to obtain a new operating license in Arizona and regain eligibility for GI Bill funds as soon as possible. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to keep students in the classroom as we await the formal approval in Arizona,\u201d UAGC President Paul Pastorek said. \u201cThis is an unacceptable situation for our students and we have already made immediate adjustments such that UAGC is providing grant funds to all affected students so that their education is not impacted by this temporary lapse.\u201d Leo covers Congress, Veterans Affairs and the White House for Military Times.

There are 104 GI Bill beneficiaries on MIT's campus, worth some $3 million in tuition to the university. At least 20 were impacted by huge delays in benefits that include tuition and up to $3,000 per month in housing allowances. The issue mostly stems from school officials never properly applying for some courses to be approved for GI Bill funding from the Department of Veterans Affairs, while admitting students with promises that the VA would support their education, an oversight that is becoming a pattern at major universities. \"The school totally dropped the ball here, and no one can give me straight answers,\" Michael Luu, an aerospace engineering Ph.D. student who has spent months at the school unsure how he is going to pay for its tuition and relies on the GI Bill's housing allowance to make ends meet, told Military.com. News of MIT's benefits issues follows a failure at Howard University, another prestigious private university, where a Military.com investigation found that student veterans suffered through at least a year of clerical errors and misfiled paperwork, leaving some on the verge of losing their homes. Read Next: As US Troops and Families Go Hungry, They Don\u2019t Trust the Pentagon for Help The systemic failure at Howard culminated in the District of Columbia State Approving Agency, which oversees GI Bill policy compliance, threatening to cut Howard off from GI Bill funding, which would have left some 235 beneficiaries on campus displaced and likely having to find a new school, and possibly cost the school at least $6.3 million a year in lost money from the benefits. Almost immediately after the Military.com investigation was published, Howard scrambled and was able to keep its status as a GI Bill-approved school. The school official who handled veteran benefits left the job almost immediately after publication of the story. Will Hubbard, vice president for veterans and military policy for Veterans Education Success, a GI Bill advocacy group in Washington, D.C., told Military.com that the MIT and Howard situations are a bad combination of the VA's mismanaged priorities in targeting prestigious institutions instead of rooting out bogus schools -- and the schools themselves failing to adequately manage student veterans. \"They  are just kind of aggressive in areas they shouldn't be on these administrative errors; it's a question of where VA is allocating its sources,\" Hubbard said. \"But these schools that accept GI Bill money but don\u2019t allocate resources to managing that, they're doing something wrong. It's VA being overly aggressive coming into contact with a school's mismanagement; both are wrong.\" Advocates and lawmakers previously focused much of their attention on schools of questionable educational merit that fly under the radar and often rely on GI Bill money to stay afloat. In 2018, the VA inspector general warned the department could waste $2.3 billion in payments to \"ineligible colleges\" through 2023. In the bulk of cases, the payments would go to predatory for-profit universities or fraudulent schools. But MIT and Howard are legitimate schools and offer some of the best-quality higher education in the country. Advocates are not aware of other cases like MIT and Howard but, given the recent issues with those prestigious schools, Hubbard said it's very likely there are other major universities fumbling military scholarships, underscoring the need for student veterans to be cognizant of whether their programs, not just the schools themselves, are VA certified. Military.com spoke to multiple MIT officials, student veterans on campus, and officials with the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education, which acts as the middleman between the VA and schools to approve programs in an effort to curtail fraud and preserve the integrity of the GI Bill.

So we need to understand exactly what is needed, go program by program so that our descriptions satisfy VA requirements.\" In addition to the Ph.D. programs never being approved, the state approving agency acting on behalf of the VA yanked MIT's Global Leadership dual-degree program eligibility after an audit of the school's GI Bill compliance was conducted and it was discovered the program should never have been verified because the school never submitted it in its catalog to approving authorities. It is unclear how students were able to use the GI Bill for unapproved programs; it could have been an oversight by the VA until the audit. But Military.com could not confirm specifics on the timeline of events. \"They never asked for approval; we can't approve things if they don't ask,\" an official who oversees GI Bill approval for schools, told Military.com on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. \"When we asked them for the information, they couldn't provide it.\" To protect students from enrolling in schools with uncertified programs, former President Barack Obama signed an executive order in 2012 telling universities that courses must be approved by the VA before enrolling students. \"If there are any shortcomings with respect to that standard which occurred during the pandemic, we will seek to address them expeditiously,\" Waitz said. In the meantime, Waitz said that any of the school's GI Bill beneficiaries whose programs are in limbo or continue to not be approved by education auditors will have their tuition and housing allowance covered by the school. The Global Leadership program was retroactively approved earlier this fall, setting up students to potentially get funds from the VA covering the gap in program approval dating back to the beginning of the year. He added that the school is in the middle of getting doctoral programs certified for GI Bill use. But it's unclear why those programs weren't approved to begin with, which is seemingly rare for schools to not have all of their courses approved. Luu stopped receiving his GI Bill benefits at MIT in September, including his earned scholarship to cover a massive chunk of tuition and about $3,000 per month in a housing allowance, money he relies on heavily for living expenses. \"It has just been silence from the school's end on what the next steps are. It has become a growing frustration, and no one will tell me what the problem is,\" Luu, who served as an infantry officer in the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade, told Military.com. Last month, MIT's aerospace department gave Luu what is effectively an impromptu scholarship of $27,000 to cover tuition costs while the administration figures out how to certify Ph.D. programs. However, Luu said he has not received all the compensation he has earned, and the school's financial services personnel are not sure how that money is supposed to be issued. But Luu said there's no plan for next semester, which begins in February. School officials have been telling him for the better part of the past year his program would be certified, but have not given him a timeline. The problem spurred Luu to file a congressional complaint to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who sits on the Armed Services Committee. Congressional complaints are a means for constituents to contact their senators or House representatives to help resolve issues, often involving federal benefits. Andrew Tresansky, a student in the Global Leadership program, had his spring semester covered by the GI Bill, but the money stopped coming in the summer and he is out roughly $10,000. The program's certification was not done in time for fall, and he paid for schooling with a separate grant and out of pocket, although the VA reimbursed him in early November. The school also paid him some money he lost earlier in the fall semester, but not for what he paid out during the summer. \"I'm saving up for a house, so I was lucky in that respect,\" said Tresansky, who previously served as a naval submarine officer. \"I'm lucky. My wife has a good job; we had a lot saved up. But we weren't planning to spend that money this way.\" Tresansky says he appreciates MIT stepping in, covering some of the lost housing allowance for the fall semester and tuition. However, it is unclear why the school hasn't covered the summer semester or how long it will take the VA to provide back pay to students given the LGO program is now certified. \"MIT has been trying to do the right thing, and VA has been difficult to deal with,\" he said. Some students Military.com spoke to pointed to a lack of a student veterans office on campus, and clear points of contact -- a common staple at most universities -- for those having GI Bill issues. MIT currently has two officials charged with certifying courses, but that staff also fill other roles at the school.

The Army veteran and his Chicago lawyer are asking the Supreme Court to take his case, which could help other long-serving vets tap college educational benefits for themselves and their families that they earned under more than one version of the GI Bill. Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times Arguing that he was wrongly denied GI Bill educational benefits, Rudisill is taking his fight to the Supreme Court in a legal quest that his Chicago attorney hopes will open up additional college benefits for himself and others and recognize \u201cwhat veterans have given to this nation.\u201d If the high court agrees to hear his appeal, its decision in the much-watched case could affect 2 million U.S. military veterans who served at least six years and earned educational benefits under more than one version of the GI Bill, a series of federal laws that entitles vets to benefits for their service. Rudisill says the federal Department of Veterans Affairs used what a lower-court ruling in his favor agreed were \u201cabsurd\u201d calculations that shortchanged him on financial support for postgraduate schooling that he had hoped to use to change careers and help other vets. He\u2019s right, former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been of the mind that, when in doubt, always defer to the veteran,\u201d says Hagel, a Vietnam War combat veteran who, as a Republican U.S. senator representing Nebraska, helped marshal bipartisan support for the passage in 2008 of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Hagel says in an interview that the aim of the law was to aid veterans. Asked about Rudisill\u2019s case, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s the veteran who deserves the break here.\u201d Former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is a Vietnam War vet who, as a Republican U.S. senator from Nebraska, helped win passage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Mark Wilson / Getty Images Enacted as a way to help keep people in military service longer and stabilize the nation\u2019s all-volunteer armed forces, the Post-9/11 GI Bill was the first upgrade of the original law in almost 25 years and now accounts for the bulk of GI Bill benefits, according to the Congressional Research Service. Rudisill earned educational benefits under two separate GI Bills: He enlisted in the Army in 2000. After getting out in 2002, he used about 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for college, then returned to the military in 2004 after friends were killed in action. He initially joined the North Carolina National Guard, later becoming a commissioned Army officer, serving five more years on active duty, including two tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He was wounded in suicide-bomb attacks and by roadside bombs. And, as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, he helped save lives by turning back a Taliban assault on a remote outpost while directing medical evacuations under fire. He was awarded the Bronze Star, among other honors, and attained the rank of captain. A wounded James Rudisill when he was medically evacuated in 2005 to Balad Air Base\u2019s combat support hospital in Iraq. Provided After leaving the Army, he joined the FBI, where his work has included investigating ISIS supporters and white supremacists. Under federal law, veterans can use benefits they\u2019ve earned under both the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for a maximum of 48 months of college or other higher education. Having previously used just over 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for his bachelor\u2019s degree, Rudisill figured he had about 22 months of benefits remaining. He planned to tap that number of months from his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to get a divinity degree at Yale University so he could return to the Army as a chaplain and minister to troops. But the VA calculated his remaining benefits differently. The agency figured that, because Rudisill still had 10 months of unused Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits, it would give him only that much, converted to Post-9/11 benefits. And that was all he could get, according to the VA. That would come to a total of 36 months under the two plans \u2014 12 months fewer than the combined maximum of 48 months that he\u2019d counted on. That ruined his chance to go to Yale, to which he\u2019d already been accepted but which he couldn\u2019t afford without the GI Bill money. Rudisill, who lives in Virginia, sued and won twice, but then saw that court victory overturned on appeal. That\u2019s the ruling he wants the Supreme Court to overturn if the court decides to hear his case. Rudisill has been fighting the VA for so long that, now 43, he\u2019s too old to be accepted into the Army chaplain program. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me,\ufffd\n\nquestion: What issues did student veterans at Howard University experience?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1087}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times One of his lawyers calls Rudisill\u2019s circumstances \u201ca trap for the unwary\u201d that can ensnare all veterans who use part of their Montgomery GI Bill benefits and expect to be able to separately tap Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Rudisill won a victory in 2019 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \u2014 the federal court with exclusive jurisdiction on veterans\u2019 matters \u2014 ruled in his favor, saying Congress never intended to shortchange veterans. The federal government appealed, and Rudisill won again in 2021, when a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with him. But the VA asked for a reconsideration by the full bench of appellate judges. In December, a majority of the full appellate court sided with the government. A VA spokesman won\u2019t comment beyond saying agency officials agree with the appellate court ruling. \u201cIt was immensely disappointing,\u201d Rudisill says. \u201cAt this point, not for myself, but for the millions of veterans who are stymied by this very narrow interpretation of the statute.\u201d Misha Tseytlin, a Chicago partner in the law firm Troutman Pepper, is part of Rudisill\u2019s all-volunteer legal team. The lawyers argue that the VA\u2019s calculations don\u2019t make sense based on the laws themselves and also based on court rulings favoring veterans going back to World War II. That so-called \u201cpro-veteran canon\u201d says that \u201cbecause veterans have given so much to this nation, if there\u2019s any ambiguity, give the vets the benefit of the doubt concerning benefits,\u201d Tseytlin says. Misha Tseytlin, the Chicago lawyer representing James Rudisill in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Pat Nabong / Sun-Times Tim McHugh, a former Army paratrooper who is another lawyer on Rudisill\u2019s team, says Congress\u2019 intent must be considered. \u201cThink about what is the purpose of these programs in the first place,\u201d he says. Hagel \u2014 who was a deputy VA administrator under President Ronald Reagan and Defense secretary under President Barack Obama \u2014 says that when Democrat Jim Webb of Virginia proposed the 2008 law, he enthusiastically agreed to co-sponsor it to help vets readjust to civilian life. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, which took effect in 2009, provides added educational benefits \u2014 including being able to share those benefits with a veteran\u2019s children or spouse \u2014 in exchange for staying on in the military longer. \u201cWe were sending these men and women back into combat for one, two, three, four tours and more,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cYou are counting on these people to go back and back and back.\u201d Of Rudisill\u2019s case, Hagel says: \u201cI hope the Supreme Court takes it up, and I hope they study it very carefully and look at all the factors.\u201d If they do, he says, the pro-veteran canon should tip the scales toward Rudisill and others like him. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed they deserve a little extra edge,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cVets don\u2019t expect anything free. But they do expect some kind of acknowledgement. And it\u2019s an investment. When you educate a veteran, you are making an investment in the country.\u201d Retired Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Petta, who got his undergraduate degree from Southern Illinois University through a Navy program, is in the same position as Rudisill. Petta\u2019s story was included in a friend-of-the-court brief in Rudisill\u2019s case last year. The Boston-area man enlisted in the Navy in 1992, serving as a submarine technician while taking classes from SIU online. He left the Navy in 2000 but rejoined after 9/11. In 2002, he became a Coast Guard officer and later was accepted into a Coast Guard law school program, for which he used just over 33 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits. During two decades in the Coast Guard, he also earned Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, which he never touched. Going by the 48-month maximum, Petta still would have had nearly 15 months of college benefits to transfer to his children. But the VA used the same math that it did with Rudisill, saying Petta had less than three months available \u2014 shorting him of 12 months that\n\nquestion: What issues did student veterans at Howard University experience?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1052}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Retired Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Petta says the VA shorted his children out of college benefits he\u2019d earned for them with his decades of military service. Provided Petta calls the VA\u2019s decisions \u201chorribly bureaucratic.\u201d He says he was told that if he had used up the three remaining months of Montgomery GI Bill benefits before applying to use his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, his kids would have gotten the 12 months he thought he was entitled to. After he challenged the VA\u2019s decision, he got a form letter saying his son could get 14 months and 23 days of his benefits. He celebrated \u2014 and then another letter arrived saying his son could get only two months and 23 days. \u201cIt\u2019s a house of mirrors,\u201d Petta says. \u201cI\u2019m not asking anybody to feel bad for me. But what frustrates me is there are service members who are much worse off than I am.\u201d Veterans and their advocates have been closely watching Rudisill\u2019s case. Among them: U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a retired Army lieutenant colonel who flew combat missions in Iraq, was awarded the Purple Heart and was an assistant VA secretary under Obama. Duckworth\u2019s spokeswoman says the senator \u201cbelieves in the veterans canon that, if there is ambiguity in the laws providing benefits, courts should decide cases in a manner that benefits the veterans seeking benefits.\u201d U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth: Give vets the benefit of the doubt in deciding benefits. AP Aniela Szymanski, a Nevada lawyer who specializes in veterans issues, says the December appellate decision in Rudisill\u2019s case glossed over that long tradition of law regarding vets. \u201cIf the court was going to err on any side, it should have been on the side of the veterans,\u201d says Szymanski, who served active duty in the Marine Corps and remains an officer in the Marine Reserves.

On March 30, the California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education officially withdrew GI Bill approval for all coursework offered by the University of Arizona Global Campus, formerly known as Ashford University. The move followed a decision by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education revoking the school\u2019s license to operate in the state. Without that approval, students are unable to use GI Bill benefits to pay for any of the for-profit school\u2019s 90 education programs. In a statement, Department of Veterans Affairs officials said they are \u201cclosely monitoring this situation and notifying impacted GI Bill beneficiaries of CSAAVE\u2019s action and options that may be available to them.\u201d About 3,000 students who were enrolled in coursework at UAGC prior to March 30 will be able to continue receiving tuition and related benefits through the end of their current term. But whether they\u2019ll be able to complete degree programs with the school or at other institutions remains unclear. The school could also get a new operating license approved in a separate state, but that process can take months or years. It is unclear whether officials plan to do that and whether a new license could be approved before the fall semester. Under federal law, VA leaders can restore full GI Bill benefits for students \u201cwhose school has closed or been disapproved,\u201d but only under certain circumstances. VA officials said the UAGC situation does not fall under those specific requirements, although outside advocates have already called for the department to reconsider that interpretation. \u201cVeterans rely on VA\u2019s stamp of approval when choosing a school for their GI Bill benefits,\u201d Jennifer Esparza, legal affairs director at Veterans Education Success, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge VA to put veterans first by embracing the law that protects veterans from deceptive recruiting.\u201d In a separate legal fight last month, a California court fined Ashford University and its former owners more than $22 million in penalties for giving misleading statements to prospective students about their education programs and post-college career prospects. UAGC officials are not liable for those penalties, which are based on actions that occured before its ownership and name change in late 2020. Officials from Veterans Education Success argue that the VA could terminate the school\u2019s GI Bill eligibility based on that court ruling, thereby making students eligible for reinstatement of their GI Bill benefits. But for now, VA officials said they are not considering that step. VA paid more than $31 million in GI Bill benefits to UAGC in fiscal 2020, according to department records. Students with questions about GI Bill payments or other financial support from the department can contact VA\u2019s Education Call Center at 888-442-4551. Update: In a statement provided to Military Times a day after publication of this story, UAGC officials said they hope to obtain a new operating license in Arizona and regain eligibility for GI Bill funds as soon as possible. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to keep students in the classroom as we await the formal approval in Arizona,\u201d UAGC President Paul Pastorek said. \u201cThis is an unacceptable situation for our students and we have already made immediate adjustments such that UAGC is providing grant funds to all affected students so that their education is not impacted by this temporary lapse.\u201d Leo covers Congress, Veterans Affairs and the White House for Military Times.

There are 104 GI Bill beneficiaries on MIT's campus, worth some $3 million in tuition to the university. At least 20 were impacted by huge delays in benefits that include tuition and up to $3,000 per month in housing allowances. The issue mostly stems from school officials never properly applying for some courses to be approved for GI Bill funding from the Department of Veterans Affairs, while admitting students with promises that the VA would support their education, an oversight that is becoming a pattern at major universities. \"The school totally dropped the ball here, and no one can give me straight answers,\" Michael Luu, an aerospace engineering Ph.D. student who has spent months at the school unsure how he is going to pay for its tuition and relies on the GI Bill's housing allowance to make ends meet, told Military.com. News of MIT's benefits issues follows a failure at Howard University, another prestigious private university, where a Military.com investigation found that student veterans suffered through at least a year of clerical errors and misfiled paperwork, leaving some on the verge of losing their homes. Read Next: As US Troops and Families Go Hungry, They Don\u2019t Trust the Pentagon for Help The systemic failure at Howard culminated in the District of Columbia State Approving Agency, which oversees GI Bill policy compliance, threatening to cut Howard off from GI Bill funding, which would have left some 235 beneficiaries on campus displaced and likely having to find a new school, and possibly cost the school at least $6.3 million a year in lost money from the benefits. Almost immediately after the Military.com investigation was published, Howard scrambled and was able to keep its status as a GI Bill-approved school. The school official who handled veteran benefits left the job almost immediately after publication of the story. Will Hubbard, vice president for veterans and military policy for Veterans Education Success, a GI Bill advocacy group in Washington, D.C., told Military.com that the MIT and Howard situations are a bad combination of the VA's mismanaged priorities in targeting prestigious institutions instead of rooting out bogus schools -- and the schools themselves failing to adequately manage student veterans. \"They  are just kind of aggressive in areas they shouldn't be on these administrative errors; it's a question of where VA is allocating its sources,\" Hubbard said. \"But these schools that accept GI Bill money but don\u2019t allocate resources to managing that, they're doing something wrong. It's VA being overly aggressive coming into contact with a school's mismanagement; both are wrong.\" Advocates and lawmakers previously focused much of their attention on schools of questionable educational merit that fly under the radar and often rely on GI Bill money to stay afloat. In 2018, the VA inspector general warned the department could waste $2.3 billion in payments to \"ineligible colleges\" through 2023. In the bulk of cases, the payments would go to predatory for-profit universities or fraudulent schools. But MIT and Howard are legitimate schools and offer some of the best-quality higher education in the country. Advocates are not aware of other cases like MIT and Howard but, given the recent issues with those prestigious schools, Hubbard said it's very likely there are other major universities fumbling military scholarships, underscoring the need for student veterans to be cognizant of whether their programs, not just the schools themselves, are VA certified. Military.com spoke to multiple MIT officials, student veterans on campus, and officials with the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education, which acts as the middleman between the VA and schools to approve programs in an effort to curtail fraud and preserve the integrity of the GI Bill. The GI Bill benefit is one of the federal government's largest, and, many argue, most successful entitlement programs. Most sources interviewed had a different understanding of the specifics of the MIT problem and its scope. Issues appear to have started in February, the beginning of the spring semester, when the school did not properly apply for eligibility of its dual-degree Leaders for Global Operations engineering program. The school also has never sought approval for its Ph.D. programs. Yet most students, including those in doctoral programs, interviewed by Military.com did not see problems with their funding until the summer or fall semesters. Schools typically must coordinate with regulators annually for courses to be eligible for student veterans to use military scholarships. \"There were some periods we submitted information, and we didn't receive a response for many months,\" Ian Waitz, the school's vice chancellor, told Military.com, referring to a back-and-forth between the school and state-level GI Bill approving authorities. \"The VA has a set of policies that are designed for very good reasons to stop predatory behavior that require some specifics on what you need to complete a\n\nquestion: What is the main point emphasized by these incidents?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The main point emphasized by these incidents is that prestigious universities are failing to adequately manage student veterans' benefits.", "usage": 1123}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

But Military.com could not confirm specifics on the timeline of events. \"They never asked for approval; we can't approve things if they don't ask,\" an official who oversees GI Bill approval for schools, told Military.com on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. \"When we asked them for the information, they couldn't provide it.\" To protect students from enrolling in schools with uncertified programs, former President Barack Obama signed an executive order in 2012 telling universities that courses must be approved by the VA before enrolling students. \"If there are any shortcomings with respect to that standard which occurred during the pandemic, we will seek to address them expeditiously,\" Waitz said. In the meantime, Waitz said that any of the school's GI Bill beneficiaries whose programs are in limbo or continue to not be approved by education auditors will have their tuition and housing allowance covered by the school. The Global Leadership program was retroactively approved earlier this fall, setting up students to potentially get funds from the VA covering the gap in program approval dating back to the beginning of the year. He added that the school is in the middle of getting doctoral programs certified for GI Bill use. But it's unclear why those programs weren't approved to begin with, which is seemingly rare for schools to not have all of their courses approved. Luu stopped receiving his GI Bill benefits at MIT in September, including his earned scholarship to cover a massive chunk of tuition and about $3,000 per month in a housing allowance, money he relies on heavily for living expenses. \"It has just been silence from the school's end on what the next steps are. It has become a growing frustration, and no one will tell me what the problem is,\" Luu, who served as an infantry officer in the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade, told Military.com. Last month, MIT's aerospace department gave Luu what is effectively an impromptu scholarship of $27,000 to cover tuition costs while the administration figures out how to certify Ph.D. programs. However, Luu said he has not received all the compensation he has earned, and the school's financial services personnel are not sure how that money is supposed to be issued. But Luu said there's no plan for next semester, which begins in February. School officials have been telling him for the better part of the past year his program would be certified, but have not given him a timeline. The problem spurred Luu to file a congressional complaint to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who sits on the Armed Services Committee. Congressional complaints are a means for constituents to contact their senators or House representatives to help resolve issues, often involving federal benefits. Andrew Tresansky, a student in the Global Leadership program, had his spring semester covered by the GI Bill, but the money stopped coming in the summer and he is out roughly $10,000. The program's certification was not done in time for fall, and he paid for schooling with a separate grant and out of pocket, although the VA reimbursed him in early November. The school also paid him some money he lost earlier in the fall semester, but not for what he paid out during the summer. \"I'm saving up for a house, so I was lucky in that respect,\" said Tresansky, who previously served as a naval submarine officer. \"I'm lucky. My wife has a good job; we had a lot saved up. But we weren't planning to spend that money this way.\" Tresansky says he appreciates MIT stepping in, covering some of the lost housing allowance for the fall semester and tuition. However, it is unclear why the school hasn't covered the summer semester or how long it will take the VA to provide back pay to students given the LGO program is now certified. \"MIT has been trying to do the right thing, and VA has been difficult to deal with,\" he said. Some students Military.com spoke to pointed to a lack of a student veterans office on campus, and clear points of contact -- a common staple at most universities -- for those having GI Bill issues. MIT currently has two officials charged with certifying courses, but that staff also fill other roles at the school. Waitz said MIT is working on hiring\n\nquestion: What is the main point emphasized by these incidents?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The main point emphasized by these incidents is that the GI Bill programs at MIT have not been properly approved, causing student veterans to experience issues with their benefits.", "usage": 1143}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Some students are frustrated that MIT, of all schools, stumbled over military scholarships to begin with. \"You're profiting off the Defense Department,\" Luu said of the school. \"There's a disconnect.\" If you are a beneficiary of any military scholarships such as the GI Bill or National Guard Tuition Assistance and your school has encountered problems certifying your program or any class, please contact steve.beynon@military.com.

The Army veteran and his Chicago lawyer are asking the Supreme Court to take his case, which could help other long-serving vets tap college educational benefits for themselves and their families that they earned under more than one version of the GI Bill. Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times Arguing that he was wrongly denied GI Bill educational benefits, Rudisill is taking his fight to the Supreme Court in a legal quest that his Chicago attorney hopes will open up additional college benefits for himself and others and recognize \u201cwhat veterans have given to this nation.\u201d If the high court agrees to hear his appeal, its decision in the much-watched case could affect 2 million U.S. military veterans who served at least six years and earned educational benefits under more than one version of the GI Bill, a series of federal laws that entitles vets to benefits for their service. Rudisill says the federal Department of Veterans Affairs used what a lower-court ruling in his favor agreed were \u201cabsurd\u201d calculations that shortchanged him on financial support for postgraduate schooling that he had hoped to use to change careers and help other vets. He\u2019s right, former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been of the mind that, when in doubt, always defer to the veteran,\u201d says Hagel, a Vietnam War combat veteran who, as a Republican U.S. senator representing Nebraska, helped marshal bipartisan support for the passage in 2008 of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Hagel says in an interview that the aim of the law was to aid veterans. Asked about Rudisill\u2019s case, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s the veteran who deserves the break here.\u201d Former U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is a Vietnam War vet who, as a Republican U.S. senator from Nebraska, helped win passage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Mark Wilson / Getty Images Enacted as a way to help keep people in military service longer and stabilize the nation\u2019s all-volunteer armed forces, the Post-9/11 GI Bill was the first upgrade of the original law in almost 25 years and now accounts for the bulk of GI Bill benefits, according to the Congressional Research Service. Rudisill earned educational benefits under two separate GI Bills: He enlisted in the Army in 2000. After getting out in 2002, he used about 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for college, then returned to the military in 2004 after friends were killed in action. He initially joined the North Carolina National Guard, later becoming a commissioned Army officer, serving five more years on active duty, including two tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. He was wounded in suicide-bomb attacks and by roadside bombs. And, as a platoon leader in Afghanistan, he helped save lives by turning back a Taliban assault on a remote outpost while directing medical evacuations under fire. He was awarded the Bronze Star, among other honors, and attained the rank of captain. A wounded James Rudisill when he was medically evacuated in 2005 to Balad Air Base\u2019s combat support hospital in Iraq. Provided After leaving the Army, he joined the FBI, where his work has included investigating ISIS supporters and white supremacists. Under federal law, veterans can use benefits they\u2019ve earned under both the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pay for a maximum of 48 months of college or other higher education. Having previously used just over 25 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits for his bachelor\u2019s degree, Rudisill figured he had about 22 months of benefits remaining. He planned to tap that number of months from his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to get a divinity degree at Yale University so he could return to the Army as a chaplain and minister to troops. But the VA calculated his remaining benefits differently. The agency figured that, because Rudisill still had 10 months of unused Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits, it would give him only that much, converted to Post-9/11 benefits. And that was all he could get, according to the VA. That would come to a total of 36 months under the two plans \u2014 12 months fewer than the combined maximum of 48 months that he\u2019d counted on. That ruined his chance to go to Yale, to which he\u2019d already been accepted but which he couldn\u2019t afford without the GI Bill money. Rudisill, who lives in Virginia, sued and won twice, but then saw that court victory overturned on appeal. That\u2019s the ruling he wants the Supreme Court to overturn if the court decides to hear his case. Rudisill has been fighting the VA for so long that, now 43, he\u2019s too old to be accepted into the Army chaplain program. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me,\ufffd\n\nquestion: What is the main point emphasized by these incidents?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The main point emphasized by these incidents is the need for better oversight of GI Bill benefits for student veterans.", "usage": 1106}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Julia Rendleman / Sun-Times One of his lawyers calls Rudisill\u2019s circumstances \u201ca trap for the unwary\u201d that can ensnare all veterans who use part of their Montgomery GI Bill benefits and expect to be able to separately tap Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Rudisill won a victory in 2019 when the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \u2014 the federal court with exclusive jurisdiction on veterans\u2019 matters \u2014 ruled in his favor, saying Congress never intended to shortchange veterans. The federal government appealed, and Rudisill won again in 2021, when a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with him. But the VA asked for a reconsideration by the full bench of appellate judges. In December, a majority of the full appellate court sided with the government. A VA spokesman won\u2019t comment beyond saying agency officials agree with the appellate court ruling. \u201cIt was immensely disappointing,\u201d Rudisill says. \u201cAt this point, not for myself, but for the millions of veterans who are stymied by this very narrow interpretation of the statute.\u201d Misha Tseytlin, a Chicago partner in the law firm Troutman Pepper, is part of Rudisill\u2019s all-volunteer legal team. The lawyers argue that the VA\u2019s calculations don\u2019t make sense based on the laws themselves and also based on court rulings favoring veterans going back to World War II. That so-called \u201cpro-veteran canon\u201d says that \u201cbecause veterans have given so much to this nation, if there\u2019s any ambiguity, give the vets the benefit of the doubt concerning benefits,\u201d Tseytlin says. Misha Tseytlin, the Chicago lawyer representing James Rudisill in his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Pat Nabong / Sun-Times Tim McHugh, a former Army paratrooper who is another lawyer on Rudisill\u2019s team, says Congress\u2019 intent must be considered. \u201cThink about what is the purpose of these programs in the first place,\u201d he says. Hagel \u2014 who was a deputy VA administrator under President Ronald Reagan and Defense secretary under President Barack Obama \u2014 says that when Democrat Jim Webb of Virginia proposed the 2008 law, he enthusiastically agreed to co-sponsor it to help vets readjust to civilian life. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, which took effect in 2009, provides added educational benefits \u2014 including being able to share those benefits with a veteran\u2019s children or spouse \u2014 in exchange for staying on in the military longer. \u201cWe were sending these men and women back into combat for one, two, three, four tours and more,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cYou are counting on these people to go back and back and back.\u201d Of Rudisill\u2019s case, Hagel says: \u201cI hope the Supreme Court takes it up, and I hope they study it very carefully and look at all the factors.\u201d If they do, he says, the pro-veteran canon should tip the scales toward Rudisill and others like him. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed they deserve a little extra edge,\u201d Hagel says. \u201cVets don\u2019t expect anything free. But they do expect some kind of acknowledgement. And it\u2019s an investment. When you educate a veteran, you are making an investment in the country.\u201d Retired Coast Guard Cmdr. Michael Petta, who got his undergraduate degree from Southern Illinois University through a Navy program, is in the same position as Rudisill. Petta\u2019s story was included in a friend-of-the-court brief in Rudisill\u2019s case last year. The Boston-area man enlisted in the Navy in 1992, serving as a submarine technician while taking classes from SIU online. He left the Navy in 2000 but rejoined after 9/11. In 2002, he became a Coast Guard officer and later was accepted into a Coast Guard law school program, for which he used just over 33 months of his Montgomery GI Bill benefits. During two decades in the Coast Guard, he also earned Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, which he never touched. Going by the 48-month maximum, Petta still would have had nearly 15 months of college benefits to transfer to his children. But the VA used the same math that it did with Rudisill, saying Petta had less than three months available \u2014 shorting him of 12 months that\n\nquestion: What is the main point emphasized by these incidents?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The main point emphasized by these incidents is that there are issues with GI Bill benefits for student veterans highlighting the need for better oversight.", "usage": 1076}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Provided Petta calls the VA\u2019s decisions \u201chorribly bureaucratic.\u201d He says he was told that if he had used up the three remaining months of Montgomery GI Bill benefits before applying to use his Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, his kids would have gotten the 12 months he thought he was entitled to. After he challenged the VA\u2019s decision, he got a form letter saying his son could get 14 months and 23 days of his benefits. He celebrated \u2014 and then another letter arrived saying his son could get only two months and 23 days. \u201cIt\u2019s a house of mirrors,\u201d Petta says. \u201cI\u2019m not asking anybody to feel bad for me. But what frustrates me is there are service members who are much worse off than I am.\u201d Veterans and their advocates have been closely watching Rudisill\u2019s case. Among them: U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a retired Army lieutenant colonel who flew combat missions in Iraq, was awarded the Purple Heart and was an assistant VA secretary under Obama. Duckworth\u2019s spokeswoman says the senator \u201cbelieves in the veterans canon that, if there is ambiguity in the laws providing benefits, courts should decide cases in a manner that benefits the veterans seeking benefits.\u201d U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth: Give vets the benefit of the doubt in deciding benefits. AP Aniela Szymanski, a Nevada lawyer who specializes in veterans issues, says the December appellate decision in Rudisill\u2019s case glossed over that long tradition of law regarding vets. \u201cIf the court was going to err on any side, it should have been on the side of the veterans,\u201d says Szymanski, who served active duty in the Marine Corps and remains an officer in the Marine Reserves. Natalie Coleman, an Illinois Army National Guard veteran and Will County Board member who\u2019s a volunteer advocate with the group Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, says the VA\u2019s mission to aid vets should override any decisions based on cost.

On March 30, the California State Approving Agency for Veterans Education officially withdrew GI Bill approval for all coursework offered by the University of Arizona Global Campus, formerly known as Ashford University. The move followed a decision by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education revoking the school\u2019s license to operate in the state. Without that approval, students are unable to use GI Bill benefits to pay for any of the for-profit school\u2019s 90 education programs. In a statement, Department of Veterans Affairs officials said they are \u201cclosely monitoring this situation and notifying impacted GI Bill beneficiaries of CSAAVE\u2019s action and options that may be available to them.\u201d About 3,000 students who were enrolled in coursework at UAGC prior to March 30 will be able to continue receiving tuition and related benefits through the end of their current term. But whether they\u2019ll be able to complete degree programs with the school or at other institutions remains unclear. The school could also get a new operating license approved in a separate state, but that process can take months or years. It is unclear whether officials plan to do that and whether a new license could be approved before the fall semester. Under federal law, VA leaders can restore full GI Bill benefits for students \u201cwhose school has closed or been disapproved,\u201d but only under certain circumstances. VA officials said the UAGC situation does not fall under those specific requirements, although outside advocates have already called for the department to reconsider that interpretation. \u201cVeterans rely on VA\u2019s stamp of approval when choosing a school for their GI Bill benefits,\u201d Jennifer Esparza, legal affairs director at Veterans Education Success, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge VA to put veterans first by embracing the law that protects veterans from deceptive recruiting.\u201d In a separate legal fight last month, a California court fined Ashford University and its former owners more than $22 million in penalties for giving misleading statements to prospective students about their education programs and post-college career prospects. UAGC officials are not liable for those penalties, which are based on actions that occured before its ownership and name change in late 2020. Officials from Veterans Education Success argue that the VA could terminate the school\u2019s GI Bill eligibility based on that court ruling, thereby making students eligible for reinstatement of their GI Bill benefits. But for now, VA officials said they are not considering that step. VA paid more than $31 million in GI Bill benefits to UAGC in fiscal 2020, according to department records. Students with questions about GI Bill payments or other financial support from the department can contact VA\u2019s Education Call Center at 888-442-4551. Update: In a statement provided to Military Times a day after publication of this story, UAGC officials said they hope to obtain a new operating license in Arizona and regain eligibility for GI Bill funds as soon as possible. \u201cWe will do everything in our power to keep students in the classroom as we await the formal approval in Arizona,\u201d UAGC President Paul Pastorek said. \u201cThis is an unacceptable situation for our students and we have already made immediate adjustments such that UAGC is providing grant funds to all affected students so that their education is not impacted by this temporary lapse.\u201d Leo covers Congress, Veterans Affairs and the White House for Military Times.
