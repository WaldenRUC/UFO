Learn more. Liat Clark Days after an awkward, clunky backpack was outed as being an early prototype of the tech wunderkind Magic Leap, the augmented reality startup is being sued for sexual discrimination by a former female executive. Not a great run of publicity, particularly when the startup is due to present its tech to board members this week, according to reports in Business Insider. Tannen Campbell, Magic Leap\u2019sformer VP of strategic marketing and brand identity, alleges that a hostile work environment was created by a series of incidents listed in the suit, including an IT support lead telling a group during a tutorial that women have trouble with computers and: \u201cIn IT we have a saying; stay away from the Three Os: Orientals, Old People and Ovaries.\u201d The suit alleges, \u201cMagic Leap was run by Abovitz sycophants\u201d, \u201cMagic Leap tolerated sexist comments and attitudes,\u201d and \u201cMagic Leap kept women in their place\u201d, with each statement backed up with a list of examples. Read more: Inside Magic Leap, the startup creating a new type of reality Incredibly, Campbell was brought on board to help tackle a gender diversity problem at the startup, famously valued at $4.5 billion despite the product still being in development. Campbell claims a presentation she was asked to put together on the issue was cancelled multiple times, and when it finally took place after seven months, CEO Rony Abovitz walked out halfway through. She was also part of a \u201cfemale brain trust initiative\u201d where ideas were floated for making the device and the company more female-friendly. According to the suit, the only solution the engineers at Magic Leap could come up with to tackle the issue prior to Campbell\u2019s hiring, was to produce a pink prototype of the device. However after one \u201cchaotic\u201d meeting no proposed changes were implemented, and no male executives attended the group again. By Matt Kamen By WIRED By Matt Kamen By WIRED The suit refers to the environment as one of \u201cmacho bullying\u201d, and claims that Magic Leap is losing \u201ccompetitive advantage to products like Microsoft\u2019s Hololens\u201d, because it fails to hire women. \u201cMicrosoft, which employs far more females on its team, developed its similar product on a faster timeline with more content that appeals to both genders.\u201d Magic Leap, by comparison, continues to delay the launch, the suit says. It ultimately alleges Campbell was fired because she: \u201cchallenged Magic Leap\u2019s CEO, Rony Abovitz, to acknowledge the depths of misogyny in Magic Leap\u2019s culture and take steps to correct a gender imbalance that negatively affects the company\u2019s core culture and renders it so dysfunctional it continues to delay the launch of a product that attracted billions of investment dollars.\u201d Although CEO Abovitz cleared up last week\u2019s leaked photo shortly after it was released - claiming on Twitter: \u201cThe photo shows a @magicleap R&D test rig where we collect room/space data for our machine vision/machine learning work\u201d - Campbell\u2019s suit now attacks the very promise of Magic Leap. Incredible and hyperreal images of whales floating over crowds and elephants cupped in the palm of the hand have become ubiquitous with the AR headset and its potential. But the suit alleges: \u201cCampbell raised concerns that what Magic Leap showed the public in marketing material was not what the product actually could do - admonitions ignored in favor of her male colleagues\u2019 assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap\u2019s website and on YouTube were \u2018aspirational,\u2019 and not Magic Leap\u2019s version of \u2018alternate facts\u2019.\" The marketing material is designed to show off its potential, to garner attention and investment, which it did, in spades. The startup has raised $1.39 billion dollars and backers include Andreessen Horowitz, Google, JPMorgan and Alibaba. But with an increasingly critical eye on the unicorn, particularly after a December report by the Information that claimed the device may not be able to be miniaturised enough, the suit will come as a blow.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Lawsuit Alleges Sex Discrimination at Magic Leap Startup\n\nevidence: Do Not Sell In a lawsuit filed in the Southern Florida District Court, Tannen Campbell, former VP of marketing, accuses Magic Leap of having a sexist, hostile work environment. Further, the suit claims Magic Leap ignored Campbell's concerns about distributing false marketing materials. Magic Leap did not respond to CNNTech's request for comment. The suit alleges Campbell was hired to address Magic Leap's \"pink/blue problem,\" or the internal idea that the product did not appeal to women. It also claims executives repeatedly ignored her attempts to present information to help solve gender imbalance within the company. Magic Leap does not say it's an \"equal opportunity employer\" on its website where it lists \"Wizards Wanted,\" the suit says. The suit goes in depth about the gender norms of wizards. \"Given that a 'wizard' generally is defined as 'a man who has magical powers,' and virtually without exception images of wizards are male, Magic Leap's recruiting verbiage contains a not-so-subtle 'women-need-not-apply' message,\" according to the suit. The lawsuit also lists numerous incidents of sexist behavior from executives and employees. Despite considerable attention from the tech press and a $4.5 billion valuation, Magic Leap, founded in 2011, has not released a product for public consumption. The company has, however, distributed videos of what it says its mixed reality headset will be able to do -- overlay images and video on the real world. According to a December report from The Information, marketing videos were designed by special effects companies. The lawsuit claims Campbell's male colleagues said \"the images and videos presented on Magic Leap's website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap's version of 'alternate facts.'\" Last week, Business Insider published a photo of what it claims is Magic Leap's prototype -- a large bulky wearable strapped to a man's back and hooked up to AR goggles.

The suit also alleges that the hostile work environment has lead to dysfunction, causing the Plantation, Fla.-headquartered company to miss deadlines. Tannen Campbell filed the suit earlier this week in U.S. District Court in the southern district of Florida. Campbell says that CEO Rony Abovitz hired her in April 2015 as head of strategic marketing and brand identity to help improve gender diversity at Magic Leap and make its in-development augmented reality product more female-friendly. Magic Leap is a much-buzzed about tech firm that has raised $1.4 billion in funding, with lead investors such as Alibaba, Google and Qualcomm. In June 2016, Magic Leap announced a new partnership with Lucasfilm, focusing on AR games based on the studio's franchises such as Star Wars. Magic Leap did not return request for comment on the case. In her first few months on the job, Campbell said she prepared a presentation on the company's gender problem \u2014 noting that no women were in leadership position at the company and only 14% of employees were women \u2014 and offering solutions including recruiting employees from colleges with strong female STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) departments. At the July 2015 meeting when Campbell made her presentation, Abovitz arrived late and ended the meeting before she finished, she says in the suit. After three subsequent attempts to meet with Abovitz to show him the rest of the presentation, she \"got the message and gave up,\" she says. Campbell was then enlisted as part of a subsequent \u201cfemale brain trust initiative,\u201d to provide design changes to Magic Leap's headset meant to make the product better appeal to women, she says. Among suggestions: a new way to attach the \"belt pack\" since women rarely wear belts. \"The group made no decisions and none of the proposed changes were made to the design,\" she alleges. \"It was window dressing.\" Magic Leap tolerated sexist comments and attitudes in the workplace, she alleges. As an example, she cited the misogynistic nature of one of the apps expected to ship with the headset, a \u201cDr. G.,\u201d game with no female lead characters, but one in the game's back story, \"a busty woman depicted on her knees\" groveling at the hero's feet. Women in technology have feared that the burgeoning virtual reality and AR development areas might grow to be as male-dominated at the video game development and the overall tech industry. In her job interview, Campbell says that Magic Leap CEO Abovitz, told her \"he wanted his company to be different, and asked (her) if she could help with that.\" However, Campbell alleges, the corporate atmosphere \"literally, prevented (her) from doing the job she was hired to do or achieving the goals she and Abovitz had discussed during her initial interview: helping with the 'pink/blue problem' or making Magic Leap less of a 'boys club'.\u201d Campbell said she also voiced concerns that images and videos used in Magic Leap's marketing material \"was not what the product actually could do.\" However, her concerns were \"ignored in favor of her male colleagues\u2019 assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap\u2019s website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap\u2019s version of 'alternate facts',\" alleges Campbell, who says she was told in December her job was being eliminated and she was terminated. Campbell says she refused three months' severance for an agreement to release any claims she would have against Magic Leap. She filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Dec. 21, 2016, her suit says. Beyond gender discrimination, the suit alleges core problems with the company's culture hinder its ability to compete with rivals in the burgeoning AR space. \"The macho bullying atmosphere at Magic Leap fosters a dysfunctional culture which creates chaos and lack of process and structure (and) hinders the company from achieving key product deadlines,\" she says in the suit. The company moved back its product launch date \"at least 4 times\" during her 1.5 years there, she says. Several media reports in recent months have raised questions about the tech company's progress towards a consumer product. In a December 2016 interview with Magic Leap chief marketing officer Brenda Freeman, Recode senior editor Peter Kafka cited an investor's concern about Magic Leap's ability to create a product. \"We are racing toward launch and we\u2019re meeting our goals,\" she told him. Business Insider last week reported that Magic Leap's engineers were \"scrambling\" to finish a working prototype of its glasses for this week's board meeting. Over the weekend, Abovitz took to Twitter to clarify that a leaked photo of Magic Leap's hardware, published by Business Insider, was a test rig. \"The photo you are all excited about is NOT what you think it\n\nquestion: What was the result of the 'female brain trust initiative' meeting?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1113}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The settlement, announced on Monday, includes a $2.5 million investment \u201cto be used towards advancing women and underrepresented communities in the tech industry,\u201d Brougher and the company said in a joint statement. Pinterest did not admit to liability as part of the settlement, a company spokesperson confirmed. \u201cPinterest recognizes the importance of fostering a workplace environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive and will continue its actions to improve its culture,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFrancoise welcomes the meaningful steps Pinterest has taken to improve its workplace environment and is encouraged that Pinterest is committed to building a culture that allows all employees to feel included and supported.\u201d News of the settlement was first reported by the New York Times. The settlement brings to an end one of the most high-profile gender discrimination cases in Silicon Valley in recent memory. Brougher\u2019s lawsuit, as well as allegations of racism and discrimination from two other former Pinterest employees in June, rattled the staff of the digital scrapbooking service, which is known for being a feel-good online destination. Pinterest told CNN Business at the time that it had conducted an investigation and found that the two employees were \u201ctreated fairly.\u201d Pinterest is this year's best social media stock Brougher sued Pinterest in August. The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, alleged that Pinterest \u201cbrazenly fired\u201d Brougher after she complained about gender bias. \u201cWhereas male executives were rewarded for strong leadership styles, Ms. Brougher was criticized for not being compliant or collaborative enough,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cIn addition, Ms. Brougher was offered a less favorable compensation structure than her male peers and had to fight for equal treatment.\u201d In her complaint, Brougher said she was fired over a video call by Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann after complaining to him and the head of human resources that the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Todd Morgenfeld, made \u201cdemeaning sexist comments\u201d toward her. She also alleged that Pinterest tried to \u201ccreate a fiction\u201d that her April 2020 departure was voluntary. When asked on Monday for comment from Silbermann and Morgenfeld, who are not defendants in the lawsuit, Pinterest declined to comment beyond the joint statement with Brougher. Pinterest hires lawyers to examine its workplace culture after accusations of racism A Pinterest spokeswoman told the Times in August that the company was reviewing the case, and was committed to ensuring \u201call of our employees feel included and supported.\u201d The company subsequently denied Brougher\u2019s accusations in a court filing in September. Brougher said in a tweet on Monday that she \u201cwill continue to advocate for workplace equity, including more women in the C-Suite.\u201d In June, the company hired an outside legal team to examine its workplace culture in response to accusations of racism and discrimination by two former Black employees. In a statement at the time, Silbermann said the law firm would review how Pinterest \u201cevaluates, promotes, and compensates employees and how the company responds to and investigates complaints of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.\u201d Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

But many women were far from surprised. Silicon Valley's dirty little secret: women throughout the male-dominated tech sector have stories just like hers. Stories of harassment, lesser pay and stalled careers. Stories of management turning a blind eye. \"This is at all tech companies,\" says Ellen Pao, who unsuccessfully sued venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for sexual discrimination. \"It may not be as bad as this (Uber), but this is the culture of tech.\" WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH:What do men get that women don't? Here are a few things And, since Fowler went public with her charges, more women are now hiring lawyers, according to Pao. \"It will be interesting to see how the companies respond,\" she said. For the tech industry, gender inequity has proven to be a hard problem to solve. Employment lawyers say women from Silicon Valley and the tech industry have been walking through their doors for years with sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. These cases show no signs of letting up. And they are not just complaints against start-up companies with young managers and loose policies. Among companies that have faced lawsuits from women over their treatment are Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter. Blogging ex-Uber employee retains lawyer Attorney Kelly Dermody, head of the employment practice at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, which is representing women suing Microsoft for gender discrimination, says she gets calls every single week from women in the tech industry. \"It's not abating,\" says David Lowe, partner with Rudy, Exelrod, Zieff & Lowe, whose firm represented Pao. \"You would think by now that these sorts of harassment issues would not come up as often, that people would be more knowledgeable, more sensitive, more trained. But the publicity from these cases has not made a dent in the number of cases we have seen.\" Six out of 10 women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances, according to the Elephant in the Valley survey of more than 200 women released last year. About two-thirds of these women said these advances were from a superior, and some 66% said they felt excluded in tech because of their gender. Uber sexism charges sound wake-up call for Silicon Valley And those statistics have names and faces. In 2014, Tinder and its parent IAC/InterActiveCorp settled a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Whitney Wolfe. An early female employee of the dating app, Wolfe alleged the company co-founders subjected her \"to a barrage of horrendously sexist, racist and otherwise inappropriate comments\" and stripped her of a co-founder title because she was a \"young female.\" Three women are alleging gender discrimination at Microsoft, claiming the tech giant's performance evaluation, pay and promotion practices discriminate against women in technical and engineering roles. Microsoft says it disputes the claims. Tannen Campbell, a former female executive at Magic Leap who says she was hired to make the augmented reality startup \"less of a boys club,\" sued the company in February for sex discrimination. Magic Leap sued for sex discrimination by woman hired to increase diversity And last fall, A.J. Vandermeyden sued Tesla for sexual discrimination, alleging she was paid less than men for doing the same work and was subjected to harassing behavior such as catcalls in a work environment dominated by men. Elon Musk's electric car company disputes the charges, saying its investigation found no evidence of harassment and discrimination Vandermeyden's attorney, Therese Lawless of Lawless & Lawless, says Vandermeyden tried to change things inside the company but couldn't. \"So she decided to do it from the outside,\" Lawless said. \u201cUntil (a company) realizes they have a problem, nothing is going to change,\" said Lawless, who also represented Pao. \"A fish rots from the head down is the old clich\u00e9.

And they outnumber men at the top schools and in the workforce. But they are in noticeably short supply in Silicon Valley. Critics say tech giants have not built a workforce that reflects available talent, whether among women or people of color, particularly in engineering and leadership roles that are disproportionately held by white men. Uber's Kalanick faces crisis over 'baller' culture Seven out of 10 workers at major tech companies such as Google and Facebook are men. Women comprise 20% or less of technical staff. Few women reach the senior executive level or the boardroom. And they don't fare much better as entrepreneurs. A sliver of venture capital funding goes to women and a small percentage of venture capital investors are women. Studies warn that tech's gender gap is only widening as women are being held back by stereotypes, biases and work environments that make them feel marginalized, unwelcome or even threatened. Fowler's Uber saga \u2014 which she titled \"Reflecting on one very, very strange year at Uber\" \u2014 bears that out, featuring stories of being sexually propositioned by her boss on her first day of work; of being told by HR that her complaints would go nowhere because her boss was a prized employee; of being left with choices that included putting up with his advances and accepting a bad evaluation or moving departments. On Thursday, she tweeted that she had hired an attorney. Silicon Valley gender gap is widening But most stories of misconduct in tech are never shared publicly. Women, especially those early in their careers, fear fallout from being known as the next Ellen Pao, who endured having her life scrutinized for three years during her legal case. Instead they quietly change jobs to flee harassment and discrimination, or they negotiate confidential settlements. Lawless says employees do not file lawsuits lightly. \u201cMost individuals, men or women, really want to work out these things internally, with their managers or with human resources,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my experience it isn\u2019t until it is so bad, when they\u2019re terminated or they quit, that it gets escalated.\u201d A disruptive but often toxic culture Lowe says he's not a psychiatrist, but suspects the root causes of these toxic work environments include inexperienced and often youthful management, a rule-breaking ethos, a sense of entitlement, and too little respect for boundaries. For example, back in 2014, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, now 26, apologized for sexually graphic emails he sent as a Stanford University student in which he talked about making 300 Jell-O shots to get sorority girls drunk and urinating on one woman. \"Any company that grows explosively is at risk of running afoul of worker protection laws because it may neglect to put necessary compliance policies and practices into place, both as rules and as cultural realities,\" says Jahan Sagafi, a partner with Outten & Golden who represents workers in claims against employers. Sexism charges hit technology industry But change is always possible. Earlier this week, an Uber driver dashcam video surfaced showing Kalanick berating the driver. The CEO immediately sent a confessional email to his staff, calling the embarrassing video \"a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up. This is the first time I\u2019ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.\" \"The flourishing of discrimination in Silicon Valley is reminiscent of what we saw with the last new economy boom, in the world of high finance that really took off in the 1980s,\" Sagafi says. \"There\u2019s a small, insular world dominated by white men who are creating a new industry and disrupting outdated ways of doing business,\" he says. \"But their justifiable pride in changing the old rules can bleed into disdain for all the rules, including society\u2019s core protections against unfair treatment in the workplace.\" Follow USA TODAY tech reporters Jessica Guynn and Marco della Cava on Twitter.\n\nquestion: What was the result of the 'female brain trust initiative' meeting?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 879}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Liat Clark Days after an awkward, clunky backpack was outed as being an early prototype of the tech wunderkind Magic Leap, the augmented reality startup is being sued for sexual discrimination by a former female executive. Not a great run of publicity, particularly when the startup is due to present its tech to board members this week, according to reports in Business Insider. Tannen Campbell, Magic Leap\u2019sformer VP of strategic marketing and brand identity, alleges that a hostile work environment was created by a series of incidents listed in the suit, including an IT support lead telling a group during a tutorial that women have trouble with computers and: \u201cIn IT we have a saying; stay away from the Three Os: Orientals, Old People and Ovaries.\u201d The suit alleges, \u201cMagic Leap was run by Abovitz sycophants\u201d, \u201cMagic Leap tolerated sexist comments and attitudes,\u201d and \u201cMagic Leap kept women in their place\u201d, with each statement backed up with a list of examples. Read more: Inside Magic Leap, the startup creating a new type of reality Incredibly, Campbell was brought on board to help tackle a gender diversity problem at the startup, famously valued at $4.5 billion despite the product still being in development. Campbell claims a presentation she was asked to put together on the issue was cancelled multiple times, and when it finally took place after seven months, CEO Rony Abovitz walked out halfway through. She was also part of a \u201cfemale brain trust initiative\u201d where ideas were floated for making the device and the company more female-friendly. According to the suit, the only solution the engineers at Magic Leap could come up with to tackle the issue prior to Campbell\u2019s hiring, was to produce a pink prototype of the device. However after one \u201cchaotic\u201d meeting no proposed changes were implemented, and no male executives attended the group again. By Matt Kamen By WIRED By Matt Kamen By WIRED The suit refers to the environment as one of \u201cmacho bullying\u201d, and claims that Magic Leap is losing \u201ccompetitive advantage to products like Microsoft\u2019s Hololens\u201d, because it fails to hire women. \u201cMicrosoft, which employs far more females on its team, developed its similar product on a faster timeline with more content that appeals to both genders.\u201d Magic Leap, by comparison, continues to delay the launch, the suit says. It ultimately alleges Campbell was fired because she: \u201cchallenged Magic Leap\u2019s CEO, Rony Abovitz, to acknowledge the depths of misogyny in Magic Leap\u2019s culture and take steps to correct a gender imbalance that negatively affects the company\u2019s core culture and renders it so dysfunctional it continues to delay the launch of a product that attracted billions of investment dollars.\u201d Although CEO Abovitz cleared up last week\u2019s leaked photo shortly after it was released - claiming on Twitter: \u201cThe photo shows a @magicleap R&D test rig where we collect room/space data for our machine vision/machine learning work\u201d - Campbell\u2019s suit now attacks the very promise of Magic Leap. Incredible and hyperreal images of whales floating over crowds and elephants cupped in the palm of the hand have become ubiquitous with the AR headset and its potential. But the suit alleges: \u201cCampbell raised concerns that what Magic Leap showed the public in marketing material was not what the product actually could do - admonitions ignored in favor of her male colleagues\u2019 assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap\u2019s website and on YouTube were \u2018aspirational,\u2019 and not Magic Leap\u2019s version of \u2018alternate facts\u2019.\" The marketing material is designed to show off its potential, to garner attention and investment, which it did, in spades. The startup has raised $1.39 billion dollars and backers include Andreessen Horowitz, Google, JPMorgan and Alibaba. But with an increasingly critical eye on the unicorn, particularly after a December report by the Information that claimed the device may not be able to be miniaturised enough, the suit will come as a blow.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Lawsuit Alleges Sex Discrimination at Magic Leap Startup\n\nevidence: Do Not Sell In a lawsuit filed in the Southern Florida District Court, Tannen Campbell, former VP of marketing, accuses Magic Leap of having a sexist, hostile work environment. Further, the suit claims Magic Leap ignored Campbell's concerns about distributing false marketing materials. Magic Leap did not respond to CNNTech's request for comment. The suit alleges Campbell was hired to address Magic Leap's \"pink/blue problem,\" or the internal idea that the product did not appeal to women. It also claims executives repeatedly ignored her attempts to present information to help solve gender imbalance within the company. Magic Leap does not say it's an \"equal opportunity employer\" on its website where it lists \"Wizards Wanted,\" the suit says. The suit goes in depth about the gender norms of wizards. \"Given that a 'wizard' generally is defined as 'a man who has magical powers,' and virtually without exception images of wizards are male, Magic Leap's recruiting verbiage contains a not-so-subtle 'women-need-not-apply' message,\" according to the suit. The lawsuit also lists numerous incidents of sexist behavior from executives and employees. Despite considerable attention from the tech press and a $4.5 billion valuation, Magic Leap, founded in 2011, has not released a product for public consumption. The company has, however, distributed videos of what it says its mixed reality headset will be able to do -- overlay images and video on the real world. According to a December report from The Information, marketing videos were designed by special effects companies. The lawsuit claims Campbell's male colleagues said \"the images and videos presented on Magic Leap's website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap's version of 'alternate facts.'\" Last week, Business Insider published a photo of what it claims is Magic Leap's prototype -- a large bulky wearable strapped to a man's back and hooked up to AR goggles.

The suit also alleges that the hostile work environment has lead to dysfunction, causing the Plantation, Fla.-headquartered company to miss deadlines. Tannen Campbell filed the suit earlier this week in U.S. District Court in the southern district of Florida. Campbell says that CEO Rony Abovitz hired her in April 2015 as head of strategic marketing and brand identity to help improve gender diversity at Magic Leap and make its in-development augmented reality product more female-friendly. Magic Leap is a much-buzzed about tech firm that has raised $1.4 billion in funding, with lead investors such as Alibaba, Google and Qualcomm. In June 2016, Magic Leap announced a new partnership with Lucasfilm, focusing on AR games based on the studio's franchises such as Star Wars. Magic Leap did not return request for comment on the case. In her first few months on the job, Campbell said she prepared a presentation on the company's gender problem \u2014 noting that no women were in leadership position at the company and only 14% of employees were women \u2014 and offering solutions including recruiting employees from colleges with strong female STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) departments. At the July 2015 meeting when Campbell made her presentation, Abovitz arrived late and ended the meeting before she finished, she says in the suit. After three subsequent attempts to meet with Abovitz to show him the rest of the presentation, she \"got the message and gave up,\" she says. Campbell was then enlisted as part of a subsequent \u201cfemale brain trust initiative,\u201d to provide design changes to Magic Leap's headset meant to make the product better appeal to women, she says. Among suggestions: a new way to attach the \"belt pack\" since women rarely wear belts. \"The group made no decisions and none of the proposed changes were made to the design,\" she alleges. \"It was window dressing.\" Magic Leap tolerated sexist comments and attitudes in the workplace, she alleges. As an example, she cited the misogynistic nature of one of the apps expected to ship with the headset, a \u201cDr. G.,\u201d game with no female lead characters, but one in the game's back story, \"a busty woman depicted on her knees\" groveling at the hero's feet. Women in technology have feared that the burgeoning virtual reality and AR development areas might grow to be as male-dominated at the video game development and the overall tech industry. In her job interview, Campbell says that Magic Leap CEO Abovitz, told her \"he wanted his company to be different, and asked (her) if she could help with that.\" However, Campbell alleges, the corporate atmosphere \"literally, prevented (her) from doing the job she was hired to do or achieving the goals she and Abovitz had discussed during her initial interview: helping with the 'pink/blue problem' or making Magic Leap less of a 'boys club'.\u201d Campbell said she also voiced concerns that images and videos used in Magic Leap's marketing material \"was not what the product actually could do.\" However, her concerns were \"ignored in favor of her male colleagues\u2019 assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap\u2019s website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap\u2019s version of 'alternate facts',\" alleges Campbell, who says she was told in December her job was being eliminated and she was terminated. Campbell says she refused three months' severance for an agreement to release any claims she would have against Magic Leap. She filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Dec. 21, 2016, her suit says. Beyond gender discrimination, the suit alleges core problems with the company's culture hinder its ability to compete with rivals in the burgeoning AR space. \"The macho bullying atmosphere at Magic Leap fosters a dysfunctional culture which creates chaos and lack of process and structure (and) hinders the company from achieving key product deadlines,\" she says in the suit. The company moved back its product launch date \"at least 4 times\" during her 1.5 years there, she says. Several media reports in recent months have raised questions about the tech company's progress towards a consumer product. In a December 2016 interview with Magic Leap chief marketing officer Brenda Freeman, Recode senior editor Peter Kafka cited an investor's concern about Magic Leap's ability to create a product. \"We are racing toward launch and we\u2019re meeting our goals,\" she told him. Business Insider last week reported that Magic Leap's engineers were \"scrambling\" to finish a working prototype of its glasses for this week's board meeting. Over the weekend, Abovitz took to Twitter to clarify that a leaked photo of Magic Leap's hardware, published by Business Insider, was a test rig. \"The photo you are all excited about is NOT what you think it\n\nquestion: Who filed the sex discrimination lawsuit against Magic Leap?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Tannen Campbell", "usage": 1111}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The settlement, announced on Monday, includes a $2.5 million investment \u201cto be used towards advancing women and underrepresented communities in the tech industry,\u201d Brougher and the company said in a joint statement. Pinterest did not admit to liability as part of the settlement, a company spokesperson confirmed. \u201cPinterest recognizes the importance of fostering a workplace environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive and will continue its actions to improve its culture,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFrancoise welcomes the meaningful steps Pinterest has taken to improve its workplace environment and is encouraged that Pinterest is committed to building a culture that allows all employees to feel included and supported.\u201d News of the settlement was first reported by the New York Times. The settlement brings to an end one of the most high-profile gender discrimination cases in Silicon Valley in recent memory. Brougher\u2019s lawsuit, as well as allegations of racism and discrimination from two other former Pinterest employees in June, rattled the staff of the digital scrapbooking service, which is known for being a feel-good online destination. Pinterest told CNN Business at the time that it had conducted an investigation and found that the two employees were \u201ctreated fairly.\u201d Pinterest is this year's best social media stock Brougher sued Pinterest in August. The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, alleged that Pinterest \u201cbrazenly fired\u201d Brougher after she complained about gender bias. \u201cWhereas male executives were rewarded for strong leadership styles, Ms. Brougher was criticized for not being compliant or collaborative enough,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cIn addition, Ms. Brougher was offered a less favorable compensation structure than her male peers and had to fight for equal treatment.\u201d In her complaint, Brougher said she was fired over a video call by Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann after complaining to him and the head of human resources that the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Todd Morgenfeld, made \u201cdemeaning sexist comments\u201d toward her. She also alleged that Pinterest tried to \u201ccreate a fiction\u201d that her April 2020 departure was voluntary. When asked on Monday for comment from Silbermann and Morgenfeld, who are not defendants in the lawsuit, Pinterest declined to comment beyond the joint statement with Brougher. Pinterest hires lawyers to examine its workplace culture after accusations of racism A Pinterest spokeswoman told the Times in August that the company was reviewing the case, and was committed to ensuring \u201call of our employees feel included and supported.\u201d The company subsequently denied Brougher\u2019s accusations in a court filing in September. Brougher said in a tweet on Monday that she \u201cwill continue to advocate for workplace equity, including more women in the C-Suite.\u201d In June, the company hired an outside legal team to examine its workplace culture in response to accusations of racism and discrimination by two former Black employees. In a statement at the time, Silbermann said the law firm would review how Pinterest \u201cevaluates, promotes, and compensates employees and how the company responds to and investigates complaints of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.\u201d Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

But many women were far from surprised. Silicon Valley's dirty little secret: women throughout the male-dominated tech sector have stories just like hers. Stories of harassment, lesser pay and stalled careers. Stories of management turning a blind eye. \"This is at all tech companies,\" says Ellen Pao, who unsuccessfully sued venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for sexual discrimination. \"It may not be as bad as this (Uber), but this is the culture of tech.\" WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH:What do men get that women don't? Here are a few things And, since Fowler went public with her charges, more women are now hiring lawyers, according to Pao. \"It will be interesting to see how the companies respond,\" she said. For the tech industry, gender inequity has proven to be a hard problem to solve. Employment lawyers say women from Silicon Valley and the tech industry have been walking through their doors for years with sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. These cases show no signs of letting up. And they are not just complaints against start-up companies with young managers and loose policies. Among companies that have faced lawsuits from women over their treatment are Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter. Blogging ex-Uber employee retains lawyer Attorney Kelly Dermody, head of the employment practice at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, which is representing women suing Microsoft for gender discrimination, says she gets calls every single week from women in the tech industry. \"It's not abating,\" says David Lowe, partner with Rudy, Exelrod, Zieff & Lowe, whose firm represented Pao. \"You would think by now that these sorts of harassment issues would not come up as often, that people would be more knowledgeable, more sensitive, more trained. But the publicity from these cases has not made a dent in the number of cases we have seen.\" Six out of 10 women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances, according to the Elephant in the Valley survey of more than 200 women released last year. About two-thirds of these women said these advances were from a superior, and some 66% said they felt excluded in tech because of their gender. Uber sexism charges sound wake-up call for Silicon Valley And those statistics have names and faces. In 2014, Tinder and its parent IAC/InterActiveCorp settled a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Whitney Wolfe. An early female employee of the dating app, Wolfe alleged the company co-founders subjected her \"to a barrage of horrendously sexist, racist and otherwise inappropriate comments\" and stripped her of a co-founder title because she was a \"young female.\" Three women are alleging gender discrimination at Microsoft, claiming the tech giant's performance evaluation, pay and promotion practices discriminate against women in technical and engineering roles. Microsoft says it disputes the claims. Tannen Campbell, a former female executive at Magic Leap who says she was hired to make the augmented reality startup \"less of a boys club,\" sued the company in February for sex discrimination. Magic Leap sued for sex discrimination by woman hired to increase diversity And last fall, A.J. Vandermeyden sued Tesla for sexual discrimination, alleging she was paid less than men for doing the same work and was subjected to harassing behavior such as catcalls in a work environment dominated by men. Elon Musk's electric car company disputes the charges, saying its investigation found no evidence of harassment and discrimination Vandermeyden's attorney, Therese Lawless of Lawless & Lawless, says Vandermeyden tried to change things inside the company but couldn't. \"So she decided to do it from the outside,\" Lawless said. \u201cUntil (a company) realizes they have a problem, nothing is going to change,\" said Lawless, who also represented Pao. \"A fish rots from the head down is the old clich\u00e9. Leadership has to say: We have a problem and this is how we\u2019re going to handle it, or there will be more women coming out.\u201d Pao says Silicon Valley has to stop shooting the messengers. The jury found Kleiner Perkins did not discriminate against Pao but her case brought national attention to the challenges women face in the tech industry and in Silicon Valley in particular. \"I hope that instead people start listening,\" said Pao, who's now chief diversity and inclusion officer for Kapor Center for Social Impact and a venture partner at Kapor Capital. \"And whether that's HR, whether that's the manager, whether that's the press, whether that's the general public, everybody should be paying attention to these stories and to these experiences and thinking about: How do we prevent them?\" Complaints not likely to stop Gender inequality is an issue technology companies would do well to address quickly, if not simply for moral reasons than financial.

Liat Clark Days after an awkward, clunky backpack was outed as being an early prototype of the tech wunderkind Magic Leap, the augmented reality startup is being sued for sexual discrimination by a former female executive. Not a great run of publicity, particularly when the startup is due to present its tech to board members this week, according to reports in Business Insider. Tannen Campbell, Magic Leap\u2019sformer VP of strategic marketing and brand identity, alleges that a hostile work environment was created by a series of incidents listed in the suit, including an IT support lead telling a group during a tutorial that women have trouble with computers and: \u201cIn IT we have a saying; stay away from the Three Os: Orientals, Old People and Ovaries.\u201d The suit alleges, \u201cMagic Leap was run by Abovitz sycophants\u201d, \u201cMagic Leap tolerated sexist comments and attitudes,\u201d and \u201cMagic Leap kept women in their place\u201d, with each statement backed up with a list of examples. Read more: Inside Magic Leap, the startup creating a new type of reality Incredibly, Campbell was brought on board to help tackle a gender diversity problem at the startup, famously valued at $4.5 billion despite the product still being in development. Campbell claims a presentation she was asked to put together on the issue was cancelled multiple times, and when it finally took place after seven months, CEO Rony Abovitz walked out halfway through. She was also part of a \u201cfemale brain trust initiative\u201d where ideas were floated for making the device and the company more female-friendly. According to the suit, the only solution the engineers at Magic Leap could come up with to tackle the issue prior to Campbell\u2019s hiring, was to produce a pink prototype of the device. However after one \u201cchaotic\u201d meeting no proposed changes were implemented, and no male executives attended the group again. By Matt Kamen By WIRED By Matt Kamen By WIRED The suit refers to the environment as one of \u201cmacho bullying\u201d, and claims that Magic Leap is losing \u201ccompetitive advantage to products like Microsoft\u2019s Hololens\u201d, because it fails to hire women. \u201cMicrosoft, which employs far more females on its team, developed its similar product on a faster timeline with more content that appeals to both genders.\u201d Magic Leap, by comparison, continues to delay the launch, the suit says. It ultimately alleges Campbell was fired because she: \u201cchallenged Magic Leap\u2019s CEO, Rony Abovitz, to acknowledge the depths of misogyny in Magic Leap\u2019s culture and take steps to correct a gender imbalance that negatively affects the company\u2019s core culture and renders it so dysfunctional it continues to delay the launch of a product that attracted billions of investment dollars.\u201d Although CEO Abovitz cleared up last week\u2019s leaked photo shortly after it was released - claiming on Twitter: \u201cThe photo shows a @magicleap R&D test rig where we collect room/space data for our machine vision/machine learning work\u201d - Campbell\u2019s suit now attacks the very promise of Magic Leap. Incredible and hyperreal images of whales floating over crowds and elephants cupped in the palm of the hand have become ubiquitous with the AR headset and its potential. But the suit alleges: \u201cCampbell raised concerns that what Magic Leap showed the public in marketing material was not what the product actually could do - admonitions ignored in favor of her male colleagues\u2019 assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap\u2019s website and on YouTube were \u2018aspirational,\u2019 and not Magic Leap\u2019s version of \u2018alternate facts\u2019.\" The marketing material is designed to show off its potential, to garner attention and investment, which it did, in spades. The startup has raised $1.39 billion dollars and backers include Andreessen Horowitz, Google, JPMorgan and Alibaba. But with an increasingly critical eye on the unicorn, particularly after a December report by the Information that claimed the device may not be able to be miniaturised enough, the suit will come as a blow.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Lawsuit Alleges Sex Discrimination at Magic Leap Startup\n\nevidence: Do Not Sell In a lawsuit filed in the Southern Florida District Court, Tannen Campbell, former VP of marketing, accuses Magic Leap of having a sexist, hostile work environment. Further, the suit claims Magic Leap ignored Campbell's concerns about distributing false marketing materials. Magic Leap did not respond to CNNTech's request for comment. The suit alleges Campbell was hired to address Magic Leap's \"pink/blue problem,\" or the internal idea that the product did not appeal to women. It also claims executives repeatedly ignored her attempts to present information to help solve gender imbalance within the company. Magic Leap does not say it's an \"equal opportunity employer\" on its website where it lists \"Wizards Wanted,\" the suit says. The suit goes in depth about the gender norms of wizards. \"Given that a 'wizard' generally is defined as 'a man who has magical powers,' and virtually without exception images of wizards are male, Magic Leap's recruiting verbiage contains a not-so-subtle 'women-need-not-apply' message,\" according to the suit. The lawsuit also lists numerous incidents of sexist behavior from executives and employees. Despite considerable attention from the tech press and a $4.5 billion valuation, Magic Leap, founded in 2011, has not released a product for public consumption. The company has, however, distributed videos of what it says its mixed reality headset will be able to do -- overlay images and video on the real world. According to a December report from The Information, marketing videos were designed by special effects companies. The lawsuit claims Campbell's male colleagues said \"the images and videos presented on Magic Leap's website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap's version of 'alternate facts.'\" Last week, Business Insider published a photo of what it claims is Magic Leap's prototype -- a large bulky wearable strapped to a man's back and hooked up to AR goggles.

Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations.

The suit also alleges that the hostile work environment has lead to dysfunction, causing the Plantation, Fla.-headquartered company to miss deadlines. Tannen Campbell filed the suit earlier this week in U.S. District Court in the southern district of Florida. Campbell says that CEO Rony Abovitz hired her in April 2015 as head of strategic marketing and brand identity to help improve gender diversity at Magic Leap and make its in-development augmented reality product more female-friendly. Magic Leap is a much-buzzed about tech firm that has raised $1.4 billion in funding, with lead investors such as Alibaba, Google and Qualcomm. In June 2016, Magic Leap announced a new partnership with Lucasfilm, focusing on AR games based on the studio's franchises such as Star Wars. Magic Leap did not return request for comment on the case. In her first few months on the job, Campbell said she prepared a presentation on the company's gender problem \u2014 noting that no women were in leadership position at the company and only 14% of employees were women \u2014 and offering solutions including recruiting employees from colleges with strong female STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) departments. At the July 2015 meeting when Campbell made her presentation, Abovitz arrived late and ended the meeting before she finished, she says in the suit. After three subsequent attempts to meet with Abovitz to show him the rest of the presentation, she \"got the message and gave up,\" she says. Campbell was then enlisted as part of a subsequent \u201cfemale brain trust initiative,\u201d to provide design changes to Magic Leap's headset meant to make the product better appeal to women, she says. Among suggestions: a new way to attach the \"belt pack\" since women rarely wear belts. \"The group made no decisions and none of the proposed changes were made to the design,\" she alleges. \"It was window dressing.\" Magic Leap tolerated sexist comments and attitudes in the workplace, she alleges. As an example, she cited the misogynistic nature of one of the apps expected to ship with the headset, a \u201cDr. G.,\u201d game with no female lead characters, but one in the game's back story, \"a busty woman depicted on her knees\" groveling at the hero's feet. Women in technology have feared that the burgeoning virtual reality and AR development areas might grow to be as male-dominated at the video game development and the overall tech industry. In her job interview, Campbell says that Magic Leap CEO Abovitz, told her \"he wanted his company to be different, and asked (her) if she could help with that.\" However, Campbell alleges, the corporate atmosphere \"literally, prevented (her) from doing the job she was hired to do or achieving the goals she and Abovitz had discussed during her initial interview: helping with the 'pink/blue problem' or making Magic Leap less of a 'boys club'.\u201d Campbell said she also voiced concerns that images and videos used in Magic Leap's marketing material \"was not what the product actually could do.\" However, her concerns were \"ignored in favor of her male colleagues\u2019 assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap\u2019s website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap\u2019s version of 'alternate facts',\" alleges Campbell, who says she was told in December her job was being eliminated and she was terminated. Campbell says she refused three months' severance for an agreement to release any claims she would have against Magic Leap. She filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Dec. 21, 2016, her suit says. Beyond gender discrimination, the suit alleges core problems with the company's culture hinder its ability to compete with rivals in the burgeoning AR space. \"The macho bullying atmosphere at Magic Leap fosters a dysfunctional culture which creates chaos and lack of process and structure (and) hinders the company from achieving key product deadlines,\" she says in the suit. The company moved back its product launch date \"at least 4 times\" during her 1.5 years there, she says. Several media reports in recent months have raised questions about the tech company's progress towards a consumer product. In a December 2016 interview with Magic Leap chief marketing officer Brenda Freeman, Recode senior editor Peter Kafka cited an investor's concern about Magic Leap's ability to create a product. \"We are racing toward launch and we\u2019re meeting our goals,\" she told him. Business Insider last week reported that Magic Leap's engineers were \"scrambling\" to finish a working prototype of its glasses for this week's board meeting. Over the weekend, Abovitz took to Twitter to clarify that a leaked photo of Magic Leap's hardware, published by Business Insider, was a test rig. \"The photo you are all excited about is NOT what you think it\n\nquestion: What position did Tannen Campbell hold at Magic Leap?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "head of strategic marketing and brand identity", "usage": 1116}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The settlement, announced on Monday, includes a $2.5 million investment \u201cto be used towards advancing women and underrepresented communities in the tech industry,\u201d Brougher and the company said in a joint statement. Pinterest did not admit to liability as part of the settlement, a company spokesperson confirmed. \u201cPinterest recognizes the importance of fostering a workplace environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive and will continue its actions to improve its culture,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFrancoise welcomes the meaningful steps Pinterest has taken to improve its workplace environment and is encouraged that Pinterest is committed to building a culture that allows all employees to feel included and supported.\u201d News of the settlement was first reported by the New York Times. The settlement brings to an end one of the most high-profile gender discrimination cases in Silicon Valley in recent memory. Brougher\u2019s lawsuit, as well as allegations of racism and discrimination from two other former Pinterest employees in June, rattled the staff of the digital scrapbooking service, which is known for being a feel-good online destination. Pinterest told CNN Business at the time that it had conducted an investigation and found that the two employees were \u201ctreated fairly.\u201d Pinterest is this year's best social media stock Brougher sued Pinterest in August. The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, alleged that Pinterest \u201cbrazenly fired\u201d Brougher after she complained about gender bias. \u201cWhereas male executives were rewarded for strong leadership styles, Ms. Brougher was criticized for not being compliant or collaborative enough,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cIn addition, Ms. Brougher was offered a less favorable compensation structure than her male peers and had to fight for equal treatment.\u201d In her complaint, Brougher said she was fired over a video call by Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann after complaining to him and the head of human resources that the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Todd Morgenfeld, made \u201cdemeaning sexist comments\u201d toward her. She also alleged that Pinterest tried to \u201ccreate a fiction\u201d that her April 2020 departure was voluntary. When asked on Monday for comment from Silbermann and Morgenfeld, who are not defendants in the lawsuit, Pinterest declined to comment beyond the joint statement with Brougher. Pinterest hires lawyers to examine its workplace culture after accusations of racism A Pinterest spokeswoman told the Times in August that the company was reviewing the case, and was committed to ensuring \u201call of our employees feel included and supported.\u201d The company subsequently denied Brougher\u2019s accusations in a court filing in September. Brougher said in a tweet on Monday that she \u201cwill continue to advocate for workplace equity, including more women in the C-Suite.\u201d In June, the company hired an outside legal team to examine its workplace culture in response to accusations of racism and discrimination by two former Black employees. In a statement at the time, Silbermann said the law firm would review how Pinterest \u201cevaluates, promotes, and compensates employees and how the company responds to and investigates complaints of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.\u201d Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

But many women were far from surprised. Silicon Valley's dirty little secret: women throughout the male-dominated tech sector have stories just like hers. Stories of harassment, lesser pay and stalled careers. Stories of management turning a blind eye. \"This is at all tech companies,\" says Ellen Pao, who unsuccessfully sued venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for sexual discrimination. \"It may not be as bad as this (Uber), but this is the culture of tech.\" WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH:What do men get that women don't? Here are a few things And, since Fowler went public with her charges, more women are now hiring lawyers, according to Pao. \"It will be interesting to see how the companies respond,\" she said. For the tech industry, gender inequity has proven to be a hard problem to solve. Employment lawyers say women from Silicon Valley and the tech industry have been walking through their doors for years with sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. These cases show no signs of letting up. And they are not just complaints against start-up companies with young managers and loose policies. Among companies that have faced lawsuits from women over their treatment are Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter. Blogging ex-Uber employee retains lawyer Attorney Kelly Dermody, head of the employment practice at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, which is representing women suing Microsoft for gender discrimination, says she gets calls every single week from women in the tech industry. \"It's not abating,\" says David Lowe, partner with Rudy, Exelrod, Zieff & Lowe, whose firm represented Pao. \"You would think by now that these sorts of harassment issues would not come up as often, that people would be more knowledgeable, more sensitive, more trained. But the publicity from these cases has not made a dent in the number of cases we have seen.\" Six out of 10 women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances, according to the Elephant in the Valley survey of more than 200 women released last year. About two-thirds of these women said these advances were from a superior, and some 66% said they felt excluded in tech because of their gender. Uber sexism charges sound wake-up call for Silicon Valley And those statistics have names and faces. In 2014, Tinder and its parent IAC/InterActiveCorp settled a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Whitney Wolfe. An early female employee of the dating app, Wolfe alleged the company co-founders subjected her \"to a barrage of horrendously sexist, racist and otherwise inappropriate comments\" and stripped her of a co-founder title because she was a \"young female.\" Three women are alleging gender discrimination at Microsoft, claiming the tech giant's performance evaluation, pay and promotion practices discriminate against women in technical and engineering roles. Microsoft says it disputes the claims. Tannen Campbell, a former female executive at Magic Leap who says she was hired to make the augmented reality startup \"less of a boys club,\" sued the company in February for sex discrimination. Magic Leap sued for sex discrimination by woman hired to increase diversity And last fall, A.J. Vandermeyden sued Tesla for sexual discrimination, alleging she was paid less than men for doing the same work and was subjected to harassing behavior such as catcalls in a work environment dominated by men. Elon Musk's electric car company disputes the charges, saying its investigation found no evidence of harassment and discrimination Vandermeyden's attorney, Therese Lawless of Lawless & Lawless, says Vandermeyden tried to change things inside the company but couldn't. \"So she decided to do it from the outside,\" Lawless said. \u201cUntil (a company) realizes they have a problem, nothing is going to change,\" said Lawless, who also represented Pao. \"A fish rots from the head down is the old clich\u00e9. Leadership has to say: We have a problem and this is how we\u2019re going to handle it, or there will be more women coming out.\u201d Pao says Silicon Valley has to stop shooting the messengers. The jury found Kleiner Perkins did not discriminate against Pao but her case brought national attention to the challenges women face in the tech industry and in Silicon Valley in particular. \"I hope that instead people start listening,\" said Pao, who's now chief diversity and inclusion officer for Kapor Center for Social Impact and a venture partner at Kapor Capital. \"And whether that's HR, whether that's the manager, whether that's the press, whether that's the general public, everybody should be paying attention to these stories and to these experiences and thinking about: How do we prevent them?\" Complaints not likely to stop Gender inequality is an issue technology companies would do well to address quickly, if not simply for moral reasons than financial.

And they outnumber men at the top schools and in the workforce. But they are in noticeably short supply in Silicon Valley. Critics say tech giants have not built a workforce that reflects available talent, whether among women or people of color, particularly in engineering and leadership roles that are disproportionately held by white men. Uber's Kalanick faces crisis over 'baller' culture Seven out of 10 workers at major tech companies such as Google and Facebook are men. Women comprise 20% or less of technical staff. Few women reach the senior executive level or the boardroom. And they don't fare much better as entrepreneurs. A sliver of venture capital funding goes to women and a small percentage of venture capital investors are women. Studies warn that tech's gender gap is only widening as women are being held back by stereotypes, biases and work environments that make them feel marginalized, unwelcome or even threatened. Fowler's Uber saga \u2014 which she titled \"Reflecting on one very, very strange year at Uber\" \u2014 bears that out, featuring stories of being sexually propositioned by her boss on her first day of work; of being told by HR that her complaints would go nowhere because her boss was a prized employee; of being left with choices that included putting up with his advances and accepting a bad evaluation or moving departments. On Thursday, she tweeted that she had hired an attorney. Silicon Valley gender gap is widening But most stories of misconduct in tech are never shared publicly. Women, especially those early in their careers, fear fallout from being known as the next Ellen Pao, who endured having her life scrutinized for three years during her legal case. Instead they quietly change jobs to flee harassment and discrimination, or they negotiate confidential settlements. Lawless says employees do not file lawsuits lightly. \u201cMost individuals, men or women, really want to work out these things internally, with their managers or with human resources,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my experience it isn\u2019t until it is so bad, when they\u2019re terminated or they quit, that it gets escalated.\u201d A disruptive but often toxic culture Lowe says he's not a psychiatrist, but suspects the root causes of these toxic work environments include inexperienced and often youthful management, a rule-breaking ethos, a sense of entitlement, and too little respect for boundaries. For example, back in 2014, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, now 26, apologized for sexually graphic emails he sent as a Stanford University student in which he talked about making 300 Jell-O shots to get sorority girls drunk and urinating on one woman. \"Any company that grows explosively is at risk of running afoul of worker protection laws because it may neglect to put necessary compliance policies and practices into place, both as rules and as cultural realities,\" says Jahan Sagafi, a partner with Outten & Golden who represents workers in claims against employers. Sexism charges hit technology industry But change is always possible. Earlier this week, an Uber driver dashcam video surfaced showing Kalanick berating the driver. The CEO immediately sent a confessional email to his staff, calling the embarrassing video \"a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up. This is the first time I\u2019ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.\" \"The flourishing of discrimination in Silicon Valley is reminiscent of what we saw with the last new economy boom, in the world of high finance that really took off in the 1980s,\" Sagafi says. \"There\u2019s a small, insular world dominated by white men who are creating a new industry and disrupting outdated ways of doing business,\" he says. \"But their justifiable pride in changing the old rules can bleed into disdain for all the rules, including society\u2019s core protections against unfair treatment in the workplace.\" Follow USA TODAY tech reporters Jessica Guynn and Marco della Cava on Twitter.\n\nquestion: What position did Tannen Campbell hold at Magic Leap?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 877}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

But the suit alleges: \u201cCampbell raised concerns that what Magic Leap showed the public in marketing material was not what the product actually could do - admonitions ignored in favor of her male colleagues\u2019 assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap\u2019s website and on YouTube were \u2018aspirational,\u2019 and not Magic Leap\u2019s version of \u2018alternate facts\u2019.\" The marketing material is designed to show off its potential, to garner attention and investment, which it did, in spades. The startup has raised $1.39 billion dollars and backers include Andreessen Horowitz, Google, JPMorgan and Alibaba. But with an increasingly critical eye on the unicorn, particularly after a December report by the Information that claimed the device may not be able to be miniaturised enough, the suit will come as a blow.

Further, the suit claims Magic Leap ignored Campbell's concerns about distributing false marketing materials. Magic Leap did not respond to CNNTech's request for comment. The suit alleges Campbell was hired to address Magic Leap's \"pink/blue problem,\" or the internal idea that the product did not appeal to women. It also claims executives repeatedly ignored her attempts to present information to help solve gender imbalance within the company. Magic Leap does not say it's an \"equal opportunity employer\" on its website where it lists \"Wizards Wanted,\" the suit says. The suit goes in depth about the gender norms of wizards. \"Given that a 'wizard' generally is defined as 'a man who has magical powers,' and virtually without exception images of wizards are male, Magic Leap's recruiting verbiage contains a not-so-subtle 'women-need-not-apply' message,\" according to the suit. The lawsuit also lists numerous incidents of sexist behavior from executives and employees. Despite considerable attention from the tech press and a $4.5 billion valuation, Magic Leap, founded in 2011, has not released a product for public consumption. The company has, however, distributed videos of what it says its mixed reality headset will be able to do -- overlay images and video on the real world. According to a December report from The Information, marketing videos were designed by special effects companies. The lawsuit claims Campbell's male colleagues said \"the images and videos presented on Magic Leap's website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap's version of 'alternate facts.'\" Last week, Business Insider published a photo of what it claims is Magic Leap's prototype -- a large bulky wearable strapped to a man's back and hooked up to AR goggles.

The suit also alleges that the hostile work environment has lead to dysfunction, causing the Plantation, Fla.-headquartered company to miss deadlines. Tannen Campbell filed the suit earlier this week in U.S. District Court in the southern district of Florida. Campbell says that CEO Rony Abovitz hired her in April 2015 as head of strategic marketing and brand identity to help improve gender diversity at Magic Leap and make its in-development augmented reality product more female-friendly. Magic Leap is a much-buzzed about tech firm that has raised $1.4 billion in funding, with lead investors such as Alibaba, Google and Qualcomm. In June 2016, Magic Leap announced a new partnership with Lucasfilm, focusing on AR games based on the studio's franchises such as Star Wars. Magic Leap did not return request for comment on the case. In her first few months on the job, Campbell said she prepared a presentation on the company's gender problem \u2014 noting that no women were in leadership position at the company and only 14% of employees were women \u2014 and offering solutions including recruiting employees from colleges with strong female STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) departments. At the July 2015 meeting when Campbell made her presentation, Abovitz arrived late and ended the meeting before she finished, she says in the suit. After three subsequent attempts to meet with Abovitz to show him the rest of the presentation, she \"got the message and gave up,\" she says. Campbell was then enlisted as part of a subsequent \u201cfemale brain trust initiative,\u201d to provide design changes to Magic Leap's headset meant to make the product better appeal to women, she says. Among suggestions: a new way to attach the \"belt pack\" since women rarely wear belts. \"The group made no decisions and none of the proposed changes were made to the design,\" she alleges. \"It was window dressing.\" Magic Leap tolerated sexist comments and attitudes in the workplace, she alleges. As an example, she cited the misogynistic nature of one of the apps expected to ship with the headset, a \u201cDr. G.,\u201d game with no female lead characters, but one in the game's back story, \"a busty woman depicted on her knees\" groveling at the hero's feet. Women in technology have feared that the burgeoning virtual reality and AR development areas might grow to be as male-dominated at the video game development and the overall tech industry. In her job interview, Campbell says that Magic Leap CEO Abovitz, told her \"he wanted his company to be different, and asked (her) if she could help with that.\" However, Campbell alleges, the corporate atmosphere \"literally, prevented (her) from doing the job she was hired to do or achieving the goals she and Abovitz had discussed during her initial interview: helping with the 'pink/blue problem' or making Magic Leap less of a 'boys club'.\u201d Campbell said she also voiced concerns that images and videos used in Magic Leap's marketing material \"was not what the product actually could do.\" However, her concerns were \"ignored in favor of her male colleagues\u2019 assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap\u2019s website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap\u2019s version of 'alternate facts',\" alleges Campbell, who says she was told in December her job was being eliminated and she was terminated. Campbell says she refused three months' severance for an agreement to release any claims she would have against Magic Leap. She filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Dec. 21, 2016, her suit says. Beyond gender discrimination, the suit alleges core problems with the company's culture hinder its ability to compete with rivals in the burgeoning AR space. \"The macho bullying atmosphere at Magic Leap fosters a dysfunctional culture which creates chaos and lack of process and structure (and) hinders the company from achieving key product deadlines,\" she says in the suit. The company moved back its product launch date \"at least 4 times\" during her 1.5 years there, she says. Several media reports in recent months have raised questions about the tech company's progress towards a consumer product. In a December 2016 interview with Magic Leap chief marketing officer Brenda Freeman, Recode senior editor Peter Kafka cited an investor's concern about Magic Leap's ability to create a product. \"We are racing toward launch and we\u2019re meeting our goals,\" she told him. Business Insider last week reported that Magic Leap's engineers were \"scrambling\" to finish a working prototype of its glasses for this week's board meeting. Over the weekend, Abovitz took to Twitter to clarify that a leaked photo of Magic Leap's hardware, published by Business Insider, was a test rig. \"The photo you are all excited about is NOT what you think it\n\nquestion: What was the purpose of the 'female brain trust initiative'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Provide design changes to Magic Leap's headset meant to make the product more appealing to women.", "usage": 1128}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The settlement, announced on Monday, includes a $2.5 million investment \u201cto be used towards advancing women and underrepresented communities in the tech industry,\u201d Brougher and the company said in a joint statement. Pinterest did not admit to liability as part of the settlement, a company spokesperson confirmed. \u201cPinterest recognizes the importance of fostering a workplace environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive and will continue its actions to improve its culture,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFrancoise welcomes the meaningful steps Pinterest has taken to improve its workplace environment and is encouraged that Pinterest is committed to building a culture that allows all employees to feel included and supported.\u201d News of the settlement was first reported by the New York Times. The settlement brings to an end one of the most high-profile gender discrimination cases in Silicon Valley in recent memory. Brougher\u2019s lawsuit, as well as allegations of racism and discrimination from two other former Pinterest employees in June, rattled the staff of the digital scrapbooking service, which is known for being a feel-good online destination. Pinterest told CNN Business at the time that it had conducted an investigation and found that the two employees were \u201ctreated fairly.\u201d Pinterest is this year's best social media stock Brougher sued Pinterest in August. The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, alleged that Pinterest \u201cbrazenly fired\u201d Brougher after she complained about gender bias. \u201cWhereas male executives were rewarded for strong leadership styles, Ms. Brougher was criticized for not being compliant or collaborative enough,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cIn addition, Ms. Brougher was offered a less favorable compensation structure than her male peers and had to fight for equal treatment.\u201d In her complaint, Brougher said she was fired over a video call by Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann after complaining to him and the head of human resources that the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Todd Morgenfeld, made \u201cdemeaning sexist comments\u201d toward her. She also alleged that Pinterest tried to \u201ccreate a fiction\u201d that her April 2020 departure was voluntary. When asked on Monday for comment from Silbermann and Morgenfeld, who are not defendants in the lawsuit, Pinterest declined to comment beyond the joint statement with Brougher. Pinterest hires lawyers to examine its workplace culture after accusations of racism A Pinterest spokeswoman told the Times in August that the company was reviewing the case, and was committed to ensuring \u201call of our employees feel included and supported.\u201d The company subsequently denied Brougher\u2019s accusations in a court filing in September. Brougher said in a tweet on Monday that she \u201cwill continue to advocate for workplace equity, including more women in the C-Suite.\u201d In June, the company hired an outside legal team to examine its workplace culture in response to accusations of racism and discrimination by two former Black employees. In a statement at the time, Silbermann said the law firm would review how Pinterest \u201cevaluates, promotes, and compensates employees and how the company responds to and investigates complaints of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.\u201d Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

But many women were far from surprised. Silicon Valley's dirty little secret: women throughout the male-dominated tech sector have stories just like hers. Stories of harassment, lesser pay and stalled careers. Stories of management turning a blind eye. \"This is at all tech companies,\" says Ellen Pao, who unsuccessfully sued venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for sexual discrimination. \"It may not be as bad as this (Uber), but this is the culture of tech.\" WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH:What do men get that women don't? Here are a few things And, since Fowler went public with her charges, more women are now hiring lawyers, according to Pao. \"It will be interesting to see how the companies respond,\" she said. For the tech industry, gender inequity has proven to be a hard problem to solve. Employment lawyers say women from Silicon Valley and the tech industry have been walking through their doors for years with sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. These cases show no signs of letting up. And they are not just complaints against start-up companies with young managers and loose policies. Among companies that have faced lawsuits from women over their treatment are Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter. Blogging ex-Uber employee retains lawyer Attorney Kelly Dermody, head of the employment practice at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, which is representing women suing Microsoft for gender discrimination, says she gets calls every single week from women in the tech industry. \"It's not abating,\" says David Lowe, partner with Rudy, Exelrod, Zieff & Lowe, whose firm represented Pao. \"You would think by now that these sorts of harassment issues would not come up as often, that people would be more knowledgeable, more sensitive, more trained. But the publicity from these cases has not made a dent in the number of cases we have seen.\" Six out of 10 women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances, according to the Elephant in the Valley survey of more than 200 women released last year. About two-thirds of these women said these advances were from a superior, and some 66% said they felt excluded in tech because of their gender. Uber sexism charges sound wake-up call for Silicon Valley And those statistics have names and faces. In 2014, Tinder and its parent IAC/InterActiveCorp settled a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Whitney Wolfe. An early female employee of the dating app, Wolfe alleged the company co-founders subjected her \"to a barrage of horrendously sexist, racist and otherwise inappropriate comments\" and stripped her of a co-founder title because she was a \"young female.\" Three women are alleging gender discrimination at Microsoft, claiming the tech giant's performance evaluation, pay and promotion practices discriminate against women in technical and engineering roles. Microsoft says it disputes the claims. Tannen Campbell, a former female executive at Magic Leap who says she was hired to make the augmented reality startup \"less of a boys club,\" sued the company in February for sex discrimination. Magic Leap sued for sex discrimination by woman hired to increase diversity And last fall, A.J. Vandermeyden sued Tesla for sexual discrimination, alleging she was paid less than men for doing the same work and was subjected to harassing behavior such as catcalls in a work environment dominated by men. Elon Musk's electric car company disputes the charges, saying its investigation found no evidence of harassment and discrimination Vandermeyden's attorney, Therese Lawless of Lawless & Lawless, says Vandermeyden tried to change things inside the company but couldn't. \"So she decided to do it from the outside,\" Lawless said. \u201cUntil (a company) realizes they have a problem, nothing is going to change,\" said Lawless, who also represented Pao. \"A fish rots from the head down is the old clich\u00e9. Leadership has to say: We have a problem and this is how we\u2019re going to handle it, or there will be more women coming out.\u201d Pao says Silicon Valley has to stop shooting the messengers. The jury found Kleiner Perkins did not discriminate against Pao but her case brought national attention to the challenges women face in the tech industry and in Silicon Valley in particular. \"I hope that instead people start listening,\" said Pao, who's now chief diversity and inclusion officer for Kapor Center for Social Impact and a venture partner at Kapor Capital. \"And whether that's HR, whether that's the manager, whether that's the press, whether that's the general public, everybody should be paying attention to these stories and to these experiences and thinking about: How do we prevent them?\" Complaints not likely to stop Gender inequality is an issue technology companies would do well to address quickly, if not simply for moral reasons than financial.

And they outnumber men at the top schools and in the workforce. But they are in noticeably short supply in Silicon Valley. Critics say tech giants have not built a workforce that reflects available talent, whether among women or people of color, particularly in engineering and leadership roles that are disproportionately held by white men. Uber's Kalanick faces crisis over 'baller' culture Seven out of 10 workers at major tech companies such as Google and Facebook are men. Women comprise 20% or less of technical staff. Few women reach the senior executive level or the boardroom. And they don't fare much better as entrepreneurs. A sliver of venture capital funding goes to women and a small percentage of venture capital investors are women. Studies warn that tech's gender gap is only widening as women are being held back by stereotypes, biases and work environments that make them feel marginalized, unwelcome or even threatened. Fowler's Uber saga \u2014 which she titled \"Reflecting on one very, very strange year at Uber\" \u2014 bears that out, featuring stories of being sexually propositioned by her boss on her first day of work; of being told by HR that her complaints would go nowhere because her boss was a prized employee; of being left with choices that included putting up with his advances and accepting a bad evaluation or moving departments. On Thursday, she tweeted that she had hired an attorney. Silicon Valley gender gap is widening But most stories of misconduct in tech are never shared publicly. Women, especially those early in their careers, fear fallout from being known as the next Ellen Pao, who endured having her life scrutinized for three years during her legal case. Instead they quietly change jobs to flee harassment and discrimination, or they negotiate confidential settlements. Lawless says employees do not file lawsuits lightly. \u201cMost individuals, men or women, really want to work out these things internally, with their managers or with human resources,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my experience it isn\u2019t until it is so bad, when they\u2019re terminated or they quit, that it gets escalated.\u201d A disruptive but often toxic culture Lowe says he's not a psychiatrist, but suspects the root causes of these toxic work environments include inexperienced and often youthful management, a rule-breaking ethos, a sense of entitlement, and too little respect for boundaries. For example, back in 2014, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, now 26, apologized for sexually graphic emails he sent as a Stanford University student in which he talked about making 300 Jell-O shots to get sorority girls drunk and urinating on one woman. \"Any company that grows explosively is at risk of running afoul of worker protection laws because it may neglect to put necessary compliance policies and practices into place, both as rules and as cultural realities,\" says Jahan Sagafi, a partner with Outten & Golden who represents workers in claims against employers. Sexism charges hit technology industry But change is always possible. Earlier this week, an Uber driver dashcam video surfaced showing Kalanick berating the driver. The CEO immediately sent a confessional email to his staff, calling the embarrassing video \"a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up. This is the first time I\u2019ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.\" \"The flourishing of discrimination in Silicon Valley is reminiscent of what we saw with the last new economy boom, in the world of high finance that really took off in the 1980s,\" Sagafi says. \"There\u2019s a small, insular world dominated by white men who are creating a new industry and disrupting outdated ways of doing business,\" he says. \"But their justifiable pride in changing the old rules can bleed into disdain for all the rules, including society\u2019s core protections against unfair treatment in the workplace.\" Follow USA TODAY tech reporters Jessica Guynn and Marco della Cava on Twitter.\n\nquestion: What was the purpose of the 'female brain trust initiative'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 878}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Liat Clark Days after an awkward, clunky backpack was outed as being an early prototype of the tech wunderkind Magic Leap, the augmented reality startup is being sued for sexual discrimination by a former female executive. Not a great run of publicity, particularly when the startup is due to present its tech to board members this week, according to reports in Business Insider. Tannen Campbell, Magic Leap\u2019sformer VP of strategic marketing and brand identity, alleges that a hostile work environment was created by a series of incidents listed in the suit, including an IT support lead telling a group during a tutorial that women have trouble with computers and: \u201cIn IT we have a saying; stay away from the Three Os: Orientals, Old People and Ovaries.\u201d The suit alleges, \u201cMagic Leap was run by Abovitz sycophants\u201d, \u201cMagic Leap tolerated sexist comments and attitudes,\u201d and \u201cMagic Leap kept women in their place\u201d, with each statement backed up with a list of examples. Read more: Inside Magic Leap, the startup creating a new type of reality Incredibly, Campbell was brought on board to help tackle a gender diversity problem at the startup, famously valued at $4.5 billion despite the product still being in development. Campbell claims a presentation she was asked to put together on the issue was cancelled multiple times, and when it finally took place after seven months, CEO Rony Abovitz walked out halfway through. She was also part of a \u201cfemale brain trust initiative\u201d where ideas were floated for making the device and the company more female-friendly. According to the suit, the only solution the engineers at Magic Leap could come up with to tackle the issue prior to Campbell\u2019s hiring, was to produce a pink prototype of the device. However after one \u201cchaotic\u201d meeting no proposed changes were implemented, and no male executives attended the group again. By Matt Kamen By WIRED By Matt Kamen By WIRED The suit refers to the environment as one of \u201cmacho bullying\u201d, and claims that Magic Leap is losing \u201ccompetitive advantage to products like Microsoft\u2019s Hololens\u201d, because it fails to hire women. \u201cMicrosoft, which employs far more females on its team, developed its similar product on a faster timeline with more content that appeals to both genders.\u201d Magic Leap, by comparison, continues to delay the launch, the suit says. It ultimately alleges Campbell was fired because she: \u201cchallenged Magic Leap\u2019s CEO, Rony Abovitz, to acknowledge the depths of misogyny in Magic Leap\u2019s culture and take steps to correct a gender imbalance that negatively affects the company\u2019s core culture and renders it so dysfunctional it continues to delay the launch of a product that attracted billions of investment dollars.\u201d Although CEO Abovitz cleared up last week\u2019s leaked photo shortly after it was released - claiming on Twitter: \u201cThe photo shows a @magicleap R&D test rig where we collect room/space data for our machine vision/machine learning work\u201d - Campbell\u2019s suit now attacks the very promise of Magic Leap. Incredible and hyperreal images of whales floating over crowds and elephants cupped in the palm of the hand have become ubiquitous with the AR headset and its potential. But the suit alleges: \u201cCampbell raised concerns that what Magic Leap showed the public in marketing material was not what the product actually could do - admonitions ignored in favor of her male colleagues\u2019 assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap\u2019s website and on YouTube were \u2018aspirational,\u2019 and not Magic Leap\u2019s version of \u2018alternate facts\u2019.\" The marketing material is designed to show off its potential, to garner attention and investment, which it did, in spades.

Further, the suit claims Magic Leap ignored Campbell's concerns about distributing false marketing materials. Magic Leap did not respond to CNNTech's request for comment. The suit alleges Campbell was hired to address Magic Leap's \"pink/blue problem,\" or the internal idea that the product did not appeal to women. It also claims executives repeatedly ignored her attempts to present information to help solve gender imbalance within the company. Magic Leap does not say it's an \"equal opportunity employer\" on its website where it lists \"Wizards Wanted,\" the suit says. The suit goes in depth about the gender norms of wizards. \"Given that a 'wizard' generally is defined as 'a man who has magical powers,' and virtually without exception images of wizards are male, Magic Leap's recruiting verbiage contains a not-so-subtle 'women-need-not-apply' message,\" according to the suit. The lawsuit also lists numerous incidents of sexist behavior from executives and employees. Despite considerable attention from the tech press and a $4.5 billion valuation, Magic Leap, founded in 2011, has not released a product for public consumption. The company has, however, distributed videos of what it says its mixed reality headset will be able to do -- overlay images and video on the real world. According to a December report from The Information, marketing videos were designed by special effects companies. The lawsuit claims Campbell's male colleagues said \"the images and videos presented on Magic Leap's website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap's version of 'alternate facts.'\" Last week, Business Insider published a photo of what it claims is Magic Leap's prototype -- a large bulky wearable strapped to a man's back and hooked up to AR goggles.

The suit also alleges that the hostile work environment has lead to dysfunction, causing the Plantation, Fla.-headquartered company to miss deadlines. Tannen Campbell filed the suit earlier this week in U.S. District Court in the southern district of Florida. Campbell says that CEO Rony Abovitz hired her in April 2015 as head of strategic marketing and brand identity to help improve gender diversity at Magic Leap and make its in-development augmented reality product more female-friendly. Magic Leap is a much-buzzed about tech firm that has raised $1.4 billion in funding, with lead investors such as Alibaba, Google and Qualcomm. In June 2016, Magic Leap announced a new partnership with Lucasfilm, focusing on AR games based on the studio's franchises such as Star Wars. Magic Leap did not return request for comment on the case. In her first few months on the job, Campbell said she prepared a presentation on the company's gender problem \u2014 noting that no women were in leadership position at the company and only 14% of employees were women \u2014 and offering solutions including recruiting employees from colleges with strong female STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) departments. At the July 2015 meeting when Campbell made her presentation, Abovitz arrived late and ended the meeting before she finished, she says in the suit. After three subsequent attempts to meet with Abovitz to show him the rest of the presentation, she \"got the message and gave up,\" she says. Campbell was then enlisted as part of a subsequent \u201cfemale brain trust initiative,\u201d to provide design changes to Magic Leap's headset meant to make the product better appeal to women, she says. Among suggestions: a new way to attach the \"belt pack\" since women rarely wear belts. \"The group made no decisions and none of the proposed changes were made to the design,\" she alleges. \"It was window dressing.\" Magic Leap tolerated sexist comments and attitudes in the workplace, she alleges. As an example, she cited the misogynistic nature of one of the apps expected to ship with the headset, a \u201cDr. G.,\u201d game with no female lead characters, but one in the game's back story, \"a busty woman depicted on her knees\" groveling at the hero's feet. Women in technology have feared that the burgeoning virtual reality and AR development areas might grow to be as male-dominated at the video game development and the overall tech industry. In her job interview, Campbell says that Magic Leap CEO Abovitz, told her \"he wanted his company to be different, and asked (her) if she could help with that.\" However, Campbell alleges, the corporate atmosphere \"literally, prevented (her) from doing the job she was hired to do or achieving the goals she and Abovitz had discussed during her initial interview: helping with the 'pink/blue problem' or making Magic Leap less of a 'boys club'.\u201d Campbell said she also voiced concerns that images and videos used in Magic Leap's marketing material \"was not what the product actually could do.\" However, her concerns were \"ignored in favor of her male colleagues\u2019 assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap\u2019s website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap\u2019s version of 'alternate facts',\" alleges Campbell, who says she was told in December her job was being eliminated and she was terminated. Campbell says she refused three months' severance for an agreement to release any claims she would have against Magic Leap. She filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Dec. 21, 2016, her suit says. Beyond gender discrimination, the suit alleges core problems with the company's culture hinder its ability to compete with rivals in the burgeoning AR space. \"The macho bullying atmosphere at Magic Leap fosters a dysfunctional culture which creates chaos and lack of process and structure (and) hinders the company from achieving key product deadlines,\" she says in the suit. The company moved back its product launch date \"at least 4 times\" during her 1.5 years there, she says. Several media reports in recent months have raised questions about the tech company's progress towards a consumer product. In a December 2016 interview with Magic Leap chief marketing officer Brenda Freeman, Recode senior editor Peter Kafka cited an investor's concern about Magic Leap's ability to create a product. \"We are racing toward launch and we\u2019re meeting our goals,\" she told him. Business Insider last week reported that Magic Leap's engineers were \"scrambling\" to finish a working prototype of its glasses for this week's board meeting. Over the weekend, Abovitz took to Twitter to clarify that a leaked photo of Magic Leap's hardware, published by Business Insider, was a test rig. \"The photo you are all excited about is NOT what you think it\n\nquestion: What did the lawsuit allege about Magic Leap's work environment?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The lawsuit alleged that the work environment at Magic Leap was hostile, resulting in a dysfunctional culture and hindering the company from achieving key product deadlines.", "usage": 1138}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The settlement, announced on Monday, includes a $2.5 million investment \u201cto be used towards advancing women and underrepresented communities in the tech industry,\u201d Brougher and the company said in a joint statement. Pinterest did not admit to liability as part of the settlement, a company spokesperson confirmed. \u201cPinterest recognizes the importance of fostering a workplace environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive and will continue its actions to improve its culture,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFrancoise welcomes the meaningful steps Pinterest has taken to improve its workplace environment and is encouraged that Pinterest is committed to building a culture that allows all employees to feel included and supported.\u201d News of the settlement was first reported by the New York Times. The settlement brings to an end one of the most high-profile gender discrimination cases in Silicon Valley in recent memory. Brougher\u2019s lawsuit, as well as allegations of racism and discrimination from two other former Pinterest employees in June, rattled the staff of the digital scrapbooking service, which is known for being a feel-good online destination. Pinterest told CNN Business at the time that it had conducted an investigation and found that the two employees were \u201ctreated fairly.\u201d Pinterest is this year's best social media stock Brougher sued Pinterest in August. The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, alleged that Pinterest \u201cbrazenly fired\u201d Brougher after she complained about gender bias. \u201cWhereas male executives were rewarded for strong leadership styles, Ms. Brougher was criticized for not being compliant or collaborative enough,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cIn addition, Ms. Brougher was offered a less favorable compensation structure than her male peers and had to fight for equal treatment.\u201d In her complaint, Brougher said she was fired over a video call by Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann after complaining to him and the head of human resources that the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Todd Morgenfeld, made \u201cdemeaning sexist comments\u201d toward her. She also alleged that Pinterest tried to \u201ccreate a fiction\u201d that her April 2020 departure was voluntary. When asked on Monday for comment from Silbermann and Morgenfeld, who are not defendants in the lawsuit, Pinterest declined to comment beyond the joint statement with Brougher. Pinterest hires lawyers to examine its workplace culture after accusations of racism A Pinterest spokeswoman told the Times in August that the company was reviewing the case, and was committed to ensuring \u201call of our employees feel included and supported.\u201d The company subsequently denied Brougher\u2019s accusations in a court filing in September. Brougher said in a tweet on Monday that she \u201cwill continue to advocate for workplace equity, including more women in the C-Suite.\u201d In June, the company hired an outside legal team to examine its workplace culture in response to accusations of racism and discrimination by two former Black employees. In a statement at the time, Silbermann said the law firm would review how Pinterest \u201cevaluates, promotes, and compensates employees and how the company responds to and investigates complaints of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.\u201d Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

But many women were far from surprised. Silicon Valley's dirty little secret: women throughout the male-dominated tech sector have stories just like hers. Stories of harassment, lesser pay and stalled careers. Stories of management turning a blind eye. \"This is at all tech companies,\" says Ellen Pao, who unsuccessfully sued venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for sexual discrimination. \"It may not be as bad as this (Uber), but this is the culture of tech.\" WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH:What do men get that women don't? Here are a few things And, since Fowler went public with her charges, more women are now hiring lawyers, according to Pao. \"It will be interesting to see how the companies respond,\" she said. For the tech industry, gender inequity has proven to be a hard problem to solve. Employment lawyers say women from Silicon Valley and the tech industry have been walking through their doors for years with sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. These cases show no signs of letting up. And they are not just complaints against start-up companies with young managers and loose policies. Among companies that have faced lawsuits from women over their treatment are Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter. Blogging ex-Uber employee retains lawyer Attorney Kelly Dermody, head of the employment practice at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, which is representing women suing Microsoft for gender discrimination, says she gets calls every single week from women in the tech industry. \"It's not abating,\" says David Lowe, partner with Rudy, Exelrod, Zieff & Lowe, whose firm represented Pao. \"You would think by now that these sorts of harassment issues would not come up as often, that people would be more knowledgeable, more sensitive, more trained. But the publicity from these cases has not made a dent in the number of cases we have seen.\" Six out of 10 women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances, according to the Elephant in the Valley survey of more than 200 women released last year. About two-thirds of these women said these advances were from a superior, and some 66% said they felt excluded in tech because of their gender. Uber sexism charges sound wake-up call for Silicon Valley And those statistics have names and faces. In 2014, Tinder and its parent IAC/InterActiveCorp settled a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Whitney Wolfe. An early female employee of the dating app, Wolfe alleged the company co-founders subjected her \"to a barrage of horrendously sexist, racist and otherwise inappropriate comments\" and stripped her of a co-founder title because she was a \"young female.\" Three women are alleging gender discrimination at Microsoft, claiming the tech giant's performance evaluation, pay and promotion practices discriminate against women in technical and engineering roles. Microsoft says it disputes the claims. Tannen Campbell, a former female executive at Magic Leap who says she was hired to make the augmented reality startup \"less of a boys club,\" sued the company in February for sex discrimination. Magic Leap sued for sex discrimination by woman hired to increase diversity And last fall, A.J. Vandermeyden sued Tesla for sexual discrimination, alleging she was paid less than men for doing the same work and was subjected to harassing behavior such as catcalls in a work environment dominated by men. Elon Musk's electric car company disputes the charges, saying its investigation found no evidence of harassment and discrimination Vandermeyden's attorney, Therese Lawless of Lawless & Lawless, says Vandermeyden tried to change things inside the company but couldn't. \"So she decided to do it from the outside,\" Lawless said. \u201cUntil (a company) realizes they have a problem, nothing is going to change,\" said Lawless, who also represented Pao. \"A fish rots from the head down is the old clich\u00e9. Leadership has to say: We have a problem and this is how we\u2019re going to handle it, or there will be more women coming out.\u201d Pao says Silicon Valley has to stop shooting the messengers. The jury found Kleiner Perkins did not discriminate against Pao but her case brought national attention to the challenges women face in the tech industry and in Silicon Valley in particular. \"I hope that instead people start listening,\" said Pao, who's now chief diversity and inclusion officer for Kapor Center for Social Impact and a venture partner at Kapor Capital. \"And whether that's HR, whether that's the manager, whether that's the press, whether that's the general public, everybody should be paying attention to these stories and to these experiences and thinking about: How do we prevent them?\" Complaints not likely to stop Gender inequality is an issue technology companies would do well to address quickly, if not simply for moral reasons than financial.

And they outnumber men at the top schools and in the workforce. But they are in noticeably short supply in Silicon Valley. Critics say tech giants have not built a workforce that reflects available talent, whether among women or people of color, particularly in engineering and leadership roles that are disproportionately held by white men. Uber's Kalanick faces crisis over 'baller' culture Seven out of 10 workers at major tech companies such as Google and Facebook are men. Women comprise 20% or less of technical staff. Few women reach the senior executive level or the boardroom. And they don't fare much better as entrepreneurs. A sliver of venture capital funding goes to women and a small percentage of venture capital investors are women. Studies warn that tech's gender gap is only widening as women are being held back by stereotypes, biases and work environments that make them feel marginalized, unwelcome or even threatened. Fowler's Uber saga \u2014 which she titled \"Reflecting on one very, very strange year at Uber\" \u2014 bears that out, featuring stories of being sexually propositioned by her boss on her first day of work; of being told by HR that her complaints would go nowhere because her boss was a prized employee; of being left with choices that included putting up with his advances and accepting a bad evaluation or moving departments. On Thursday, she tweeted that she had hired an attorney. Silicon Valley gender gap is widening But most stories of misconduct in tech are never shared publicly. Women, especially those early in their careers, fear fallout from being known as the next Ellen Pao, who endured having her life scrutinized for three years during her legal case. Instead they quietly change jobs to flee harassment and discrimination, or they negotiate confidential settlements. Lawless says employees do not file lawsuits lightly. \u201cMost individuals, men or women, really want to work out these things internally, with their managers or with human resources,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my experience it isn\u2019t until it is so bad, when they\u2019re terminated or they quit, that it gets escalated.\u201d A disruptive but often toxic culture Lowe says he's not a psychiatrist, but suspects the root causes of these toxic work environments include inexperienced and often youthful management, a rule-breaking ethos, a sense of entitlement, and too little respect for boundaries. For example, back in 2014, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, now 26, apologized for sexually graphic emails he sent as a Stanford University student in which he talked about making 300 Jell-O shots to get sorority girls drunk and urinating on one woman. \"Any company that grows explosively is at risk of running afoul of worker protection laws because it may neglect to put necessary compliance policies and practices into place, both as rules and as cultural realities,\" says Jahan Sagafi, a partner with Outten & Golden who represents workers in claims against employers. Sexism charges hit technology industry But change is always possible. Earlier this week, an Uber driver dashcam video surfaced showing Kalanick berating the driver. The CEO immediately sent a confessional email to his staff, calling the embarrassing video \"a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up. This is the first time I\u2019ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.\" \"The flourishing of discrimination in Silicon Valley is reminiscent of what we saw with the last new economy boom, in the world of high finance that really took off in the 1980s,\" Sagafi says. \"There\u2019s a small, insular world dominated by white men who are creating a new industry and disrupting outdated ways of doing business,\" he says. \"But their justifiable pride in changing the old rules can bleed into disdain for all the rules, including society\u2019s core protections against unfair treatment in the workplace.\" Follow USA TODAY tech reporters Jessica Guynn and Marco della Cava on Twitter.\n\nquestion: What did the lawsuit allege about Magic Leap's work environment?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 877}, "Your task is to judge whether the following two answers are factually consistent.
