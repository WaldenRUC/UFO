A senior leader of the group known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), Sheikh Nasr Ben Ali al-Aanesi, claims in the video released Wednesday that AQAP ordered, planned, and funded the attack in Paris with the guidance of al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri, and in line with recommendations of his predecessor Osama bin Laden. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf says U.S. intelligence is still looking at possible links between AQAP and the Paris attackers but has determined the AQAP video is authentic. According to the video, the attack was planned as revenge for Charlie Hebdo's repeated publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Any depiction of the Prophet is contrary to Islamic law and deeply offensive to many adherents of the faith. Aanesi cited a warning from bin Laden against publishing images of the Prophet, quoting the slain al Qaeda chief directly: \"If there is no check on the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions. The answer is what you see, not what you hear.\" The video claim was released exactly a week after the attacks, and on the same day that the Charlie Hebdo staff who survived the massacre released a new edition, featuring the Prophet on the front cover. The newspaper, which usually sells about 60,000 copies, flew off shelves Wednesday morning. An initial run of 3 million copies sold out almost as soon as newsstands opened. Charlie Hebdo was reportedly to print an additional 2 million copies to meet demand. Aanesi said American-born AQAP leader Anwar al-Awlaki was the man in charge of coordinating contacts with the attackers, French-Algerian brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi. Awlaki himself was killed in a U.S. drone strike in southern Yemen in September 2011. The video did not include any images which proved the link between the Kouachi brothers and members of AQAP. However, CBS News learned on Tuesday that Said Kouachi returned from Yemen in 2011 with $20,000 to fund the operation. Witnesses to the attack in Paris said the brothers repeatedly claimed to be members of AQAP during the siege. The statement by Aanesi did not make any claims suggesting the Kouachi brothers coordinated their attack with Amedy Coulibaly, the man who shot a police officer to death the day after the Charlie Hebdo attack and then died in a police raid on a Jewish grocery store in Paris just moments after the Kouachis were killed on Friday. Coulibaly killed four hostages in the shop before the raid. Aanesi also made no explicit mention of additional members of a terror cell in France to which authorities now believe the Kouachis belonged. Police were searching for as many as six people believed to have links to the men. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said earlier this week that the manhunt was urgent because \"the threat is still present.\" U.S. intelligence officials have warned for years -- even as much of the attention in the West shifted to rival group ISIS -- that al Qaeda's Yemen branch represents the most immediate threat to the U.S. and it's allies. Cherif Kouachi had a previous arrest in France, which CBS News' Bob Orr said may have made him the more well-known of the two. But, his older brother Said may actually have had stronger ties to AQAP. Orr reported that, according to intelligence sources, Said spent \"several months\" training with the group in Yemen, at the time when Awlaki was running its operations. Awlaki was the inspiration behind Nidal Hassan's massacre at Fort Hood, and he was also behind the failed attempts to blow up a commercial airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day, 2009, and to try and hit the U.S. with bombs smuggled onto aircraft inside computer printer parts. All of those attacks relied heavily on one of AQAP's strengths; bomb making. The group in Yemen boasts one of al Qaeda's most accomplished bomb makers, Ibrahim al-Asiri, and Orr reported Wednesday that the Paris attacks could represent a change in thinking by the group, to \"settle for what's possible.\" In France, CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer says security forces are reviewing their operations over the three days of attacks and hostage-takings, and their investigation into the incidents and who was behind them is wide-ranging. In addition to the suspected members of the terror cell, police have said they're looking for a Mini Cooper car registered to Hayat Boumeddiene, the partner of Coulibaly. They are also trying to track down Boumeddiene herself, who Turkish officials\n\nquestion: Who claimed responsibility for the massacre at the Paris headquarters of Charlie Hebdo?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "AQAP", "usage": 1123}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The attack was years in the making, AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi said in a video, claiming U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was the mastermind behind it. Al-Awlaki was the terror group\u2019s spokesman before a U.S. drone strike killed him in Yemen in 2011. AQAP did not claim responsibility for the kosher grocery store siege but praised it. What is al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula? French security services have identified a suspected accomplice in that attack, according to the French newspaper Le Parisien. Coulibaly was killed in a police raid to end the siege. The Kouachi brothers also are dead. But investigators\u2019 efforts to track down possible suspects tied to last week\u2019s attacks are continuing. So is the magazine that the terrorists targeted last week. Charlie Hebdo\u2019s new edition hit newsstands Wednesday \u2013 a week after authorities say terrorists Said and Cherif Kouachi burst into its newsroom and gunned down staffers. New Charlie Hebdo issue on sale The cover features a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed crying. All 3 million copies sold out quickly, but more copies are coming soon, the magazine said. The claim of responsibility for the deadly attack on the magazine came in a video showing AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi, with pictures of the Kouachis in the background. \u201cWhen the heroes were assigned, they accepted. They promised and fulfilled,\u201d al-Ansi said. Who is AQAP terror group commander al-Ansi? He praised the attack, saying it was revenge for Charlie Hebdo\u2019s depictions of Mohammed. Al-Ansi blamed not only Charlie Hebdo, but also France and the United States. \u201cIt is France that has shared all of America\u2019s crimes,\u201d al-Ansi added. \u201cIt is France that has committed crimes in Mali and the Islamic Maghreb. It is France that supports the annihilation of Muslims in Central Africa in the name of race cleansing.\u201d (\u201cIslamic Maghreb\u201d refers to North Africa.) \u201cIt was a blessing from Allah\u201d that the kosher market siege, in which four hostages were killed, took place about the same time, al-Ansi said. U.S. authorities said they think the video is authentic. But they weren\u2019t ready to say that AQAP helped carry out the assault. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet. There are good indicators\u201d that the group was behind the attack, but the intelligence community is still assessing, a senior administration official told CNN. Earlier in the day, U.S. National Security Council spokesman Alistair Baskey said that, \u201cif genuine, this is only the latest example of the wanton brutality that is al Qaeda\u2019s calling card and which it has visited upon innocents of all faiths.\u201d French newspaper La Voix du Nord reports that Coulibaly also secured funds that may have been used in the attack on the kosher supermarket. Le Parisien\u2019s report said investigators identified Coulibaly\u2019s suspected accomplice using keys for a motorbike discovered in an apartment they raided over the weekend. Neighbors told CNN the apartment, in the Paris suburb of Gentilly, was raided Saturday by police. Terrorist's hideout apartment raided Also found inside the apartment, according to Le Parisien: a stash of weapons, explosives and two ISIS flags. Coulibaly purportedly told authorities before he was killed that he belonged to ISIS. Police also suspect the man may have been responsible for shooting and wounding a jogger last week \u2013 an attack that the Paris prosecutor has said could be tied to Coulibaly because the ammunition used was the same as ammunition found at the scene of the kosher market attack, Le Parisien said. Paris police would not comment to CNN on the contents of the report. Le Parisien says Coulibaly\u2019s accomplice, who the newspaper did not name, is suspected to have fled France, possibly for Syria. Officials have also said they believe Hayat Boumeddiene, Coulibaly\u2019s widow who may have played a role in the attacks, has fled to Syria. With France on its highest level of alert, 10,000 troops have deployed across the country. Thousands of police officers are on patrol, including hundreds assigned to protect Jewish schools. Since the attacks, dozens of cases have been opened in France against people accused of expressing support for terrorism, the Justice Ministry said. It\u2019s unclear how many people are blamed for the 54 infractions. The cases include investigations involving phone threats, cyberattacks and Facebook posts, the ministry said. Some are in prison awaiting trial\n\nquestion: Who claimed responsibility for the massacre at the Paris headquarters of Charlie Hebdo?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula", "usage": 1082}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

With concerns on the rise, a controversial French comedian was accused of publicly supporting terrorism, French media reported. Dieudonne M\u2019bala M\u2019bala, known as Dieudonne, was arrested in Paris, according to media reports, which tied his arrest to a recent Facebook post from the comedian. \u201cJe suis Charlie Coulibaly,\u201d the post said, combined the last name of one of the terrorists involved in last week\u2019s attacks with the widely used phrase expressing solidarity with victims. That post has since been deleted. French comic faces 7 years in prison for Facebook post Dieudonne has previously been fined several times in France for anti-Semitic commentary. Last year, the French government said it wanted to ban his live performances. And British authorities banned him from entering the United Kingdom. On Monday, Dieudonne issued a statement with his stance on the terror attacks. \u201cSince the beginning of last year, I have been treated as public enemy number one, when all I try to do is make people laugh, and laugh about death,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the French interior minister. \u201cBecause death laughs at us all, as Charlie knows now, unfortunately.\u201d After his release from custody Wednesday, his lawyer told France\u2019s iTELE network that the comedian returned to performing his act at a theater in the same Paris neighborhood where Charlie Hebdo\u2019s offices are located.

Nasr al-Ansi, who had been serving as an ideological leader, was among several fighters killed in a CIA drone strike on April 21, Martin confirms. Washington considers AQAP to be the most powerful in the terrorist network. Al-Ansi's death was announced by al Qaeda operative Khaled Batarfi in a video posted on the Internet. Batarfi did not say when or where in Yemen he was killed, adding only that al-Ansi's eldest son, Mohammed, and several fighters were killed in the same airstrike. Al-Ansi, believed to have been close to al Qaeda's late leader Osama Bin Laden, has made several video appearances on behalf of the group's Yemen branch. In January, he announced that the Yemen branch was responsible for the attack on the offices of the French satirical magazine that killed 12 people. After the attacks, AQAP posted an 11-minute video on the group's Twitter account and al-Ansi warned of more \"tragedies and terror\" in the future. Al-Ansi said AQAP \"chose the target, laid out the plan and financed the operation.\" He said the radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in September 2011, had arranged the attack. Al-Ansi's death comes less than a month after AQAP announced that its top cleric, a Saudi-national who had a $5 million bounty on his head, was killed in an alleged drone attack. In late March, about 100 U.S. military advisers withdrew from the al-Annad air base where they had been leading the U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Yemen. Washington rarely comments on drone attacks. U.S. officials had been concerned their counterterrorism capabilities would be diminished because of the withdrawal of their staff. However, they said the al Qaeda branch will likely be drawn toward the internal Yemeni conflict, and away from plotting to go after Western targets.

A senior leader of the group known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), Sheikh Nasr Ben Ali al-Aanesi, claims in the video released Wednesday that AQAP ordered, planned, and funded the attack in Paris with the guidance of al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri, and in line with recommendations of his predecessor Osama bin Laden. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf says U.S. intelligence is still looking at possible links between AQAP and the Paris attackers but has determined the AQAP video is authentic. According to the video, the attack was planned as revenge for Charlie Hebdo's repeated publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Any depiction of the Prophet is contrary to Islamic law and deeply offensive to many adherents of the faith. Aanesi cited a warning from bin Laden against publishing images of the Prophet, quoting the slain al Qaeda chief directly: \"If there is no check on the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions. The answer is what you see, not what you hear.\" The video claim was released exactly a week after the attacks, and on the same day that the Charlie Hebdo staff who survived the massacre released a new edition, featuring the Prophet on the front cover. The newspaper, which usually sells about 60,000 copies, flew off shelves Wednesday morning. An initial run of 3 million copies sold out almost as soon as newsstands opened. Charlie Hebdo was reportedly to print an additional 2 million copies to meet demand. Aanesi said American-born AQAP leader Anwar al-Awlaki was the man in charge of coordinating contacts with the attackers, French-Algerian brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi. Awlaki himself was killed in a U.S. drone strike in southern Yemen in September 2011. The video did not include any images which proved the link between the Kouachi brothers and members of AQAP. However, CBS News learned on Tuesday that Said Kouachi returned from Yemen in 2011 with $20,000 to fund the operation. Witnesses to the attack in Paris said the brothers repeatedly claimed to be members of AQAP during the siege. The statement by Aanesi did not make any claims suggesting the Kouachi brothers coordinated their attack with Amedy Coulibaly, the man who shot a police officer to death the day after the Charlie Hebdo attack and then died in a police raid on a Jewish grocery store in Paris just moments after the Kouachis were killed on Friday. Coulibaly killed four hostages in the shop before the raid. Aanesi also made no explicit mention of additional members of a terror cell in France to which authorities now believe the Kouachis belonged. Police were searching for as many as six people believed to have links to the men. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said earlier this week that the manhunt was urgent because \"the threat is still present.\" U.S. intelligence officials have warned for years -- even as much of the attention in the West shifted to rival group ISIS -- that al Qaeda's Yemen branch represents the most immediate threat to the U.S. and it's allies. Cherif Kouachi had a previous arrest in France, which CBS News' Bob Orr said may have made him the more well-known of the two. But, his older brother Said may actually have had stronger ties to AQAP. Orr reported that, according to intelligence sources, Said spent \"several months\" training with the group in Yemen, at the time when Awlaki was running its operations. Awlaki was the inspiration behind Nidal Hassan's massacre at Fort Hood, and he was also behind the failed attempts to blow up a commercial airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day, 2009, and to try and hit the U.S. with bombs smuggled onto aircraft inside computer printer parts. All of those attacks relied heavily on one of AQAP's strengths; bomb making. The group in Yemen boasts one of al Qaeda's most accomplished bomb makers, Ibrahim al-Asiri, and Orr reported Wednesday that the Paris attacks could represent a change in thinking by the group, to \"settle for what's possible.\" In France, CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer says security forces are reviewing their operations over the three days of attacks and hostage-takings, and their investigation into the incidents and who was behind them is wide-ranging. In addition to the suspected members of the terror cell, police have said they're looking for a Mini Cooper car registered to Hayat Boumeddiene, the partner of Coulibaly.

The attack was years in the making, AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi said in a video, claiming U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was the mastermind behind it. Al-Awlaki was the terror group\u2019s spokesman before a U.S. drone strike killed him in Yemen in 2011. AQAP did not claim responsibility for the kosher grocery store siege but praised it. What is al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula? French security services have identified a suspected accomplice in that attack, according to the French newspaper Le Parisien. Coulibaly was killed in a police raid to end the siege. The Kouachi brothers also are dead. But investigators\u2019 efforts to track down possible suspects tied to last week\u2019s attacks are continuing. So is the magazine that the terrorists targeted last week. Charlie Hebdo\u2019s new edition hit newsstands Wednesday \u2013 a week after authorities say terrorists Said and Cherif Kouachi burst into its newsroom and gunned down staffers. New Charlie Hebdo issue on sale The cover features a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed crying. All 3 million copies sold out quickly, but more copies are coming soon, the magazine said. The claim of responsibility for the deadly attack on the magazine came in a video showing AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi, with pictures of the Kouachis in the background. \u201cWhen the heroes were assigned, they accepted. They promised and fulfilled,\u201d al-Ansi said. Who is AQAP terror group commander al-Ansi? He praised the attack, saying it was revenge for Charlie Hebdo\u2019s depictions of Mohammed. Al-Ansi blamed not only Charlie Hebdo, but also France and the United States. \u201cIt is France that has shared all of America\u2019s crimes,\u201d al-Ansi added. \u201cIt is France that has committed crimes in Mali and the Islamic Maghreb. It is France that supports the annihilation of Muslims in Central Africa in the name of race cleansing.\u201d (\u201cIslamic Maghreb\u201d refers to North Africa.) \u201cIt was a blessing from Allah\u201d that the kosher market siege, in which four hostages were killed, took place about the same time, al-Ansi said. U.S. authorities said they think the video is authentic. But they weren\u2019t ready to say that AQAP helped carry out the assault. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet. There are good indicators\u201d that the group was behind the attack, but the intelligence community is still assessing, a senior administration official told CNN. Earlier in the day, U.S. National Security Council spokesman Alistair Baskey said that, \u201cif genuine, this is only the latest example of the wanton brutality that is al Qaeda\u2019s calling card and which it has visited upon innocents of all faiths.\u201d French newspaper La Voix du Nord reports that Coulibaly also secured funds that may have been used in the attack on the kosher supermarket. Le Parisien\u2019s report said investigators identified Coulibaly\u2019s suspected accomplice using keys for a motorbike discovered in an apartment they raided over the weekend. Neighbors told CNN the apartment, in the Paris suburb of Gentilly, was raided Saturday by police. Terrorist's hideout apartment raided Also found inside the apartment, according to Le Parisien: a stash of weapons, explosives and two ISIS flags. Coulibaly purportedly told authorities before he was killed that he belonged to ISIS. Police also suspect the man may have been responsible for shooting and wounding a jogger last week \u2013 an attack that the Paris prosecutor has said could be tied to Coulibaly because the ammunition used was the same as ammunition found at the scene of the kosher market attack, Le Parisien said. Paris police would not comment to CNN on the contents of the report. Le Parisien says Coulibaly\u2019s accomplice, who the newspaper did not name, is suspected to have fled France, possibly for Syria. Officials have also said they believe Hayat Boumeddiene, Coulibaly\u2019s widow who may have played a role in the attacks, has fled to Syria. With France on its highest level of alert, 10,000 troops have deployed across the country. Thousands of police officers are on patrol, including hundreds assigned to protect Jewish schools. Since the attacks, dozens of cases have been opened in France against people accused of expressing support for terrorism, the Justice Ministry said. It\u2019s unclear how many people are blamed for the 54 infractions. The cases include investigations involving phone threats, cyberattacks and Facebook posts, the ministry said.

Penalties for the alleged crimes vary, Rance said. Justice Minister Christiane Taubira \u201cconsiders that words or actions of a racist or anti-Semitic nature, or that cause hateful, violent, or discriminatory behavior, or advocate terrorism, or target security forces must be fought and pursued with the utmost vigor,\u201d her office said in a statement. She \u201casked prosecutors to exercise extreme reactivity in the conduct of public action against the perpetrators of such crimes,\u201d the statement said. With concerns on the rise, a controversial French comedian was accused of publicly supporting terrorism, French media reported. Dieudonne M\u2019bala M\u2019bala, known as Dieudonne, was arrested in Paris, according to media reports, which tied his arrest to a recent Facebook post from the comedian. \u201cJe suis Charlie Coulibaly,\u201d the post said, combined the last name of one of the terrorists involved in last week\u2019s attacks with the widely used phrase expressing solidarity with victims. That post has since been deleted. French comic faces 7 years in prison for Facebook post Dieudonne has previously been fined several times in France for anti-Semitic commentary. Last year, the French government said it wanted to ban his live performances. And British authorities banned him from entering the United Kingdom. On Monday, Dieudonne issued a statement with his stance on the terror attacks. \u201cSince the beginning of last year, I have been treated as public enemy number one, when all I try to do is make people laugh, and laugh about death,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the French interior minister. \u201cBecause death laughs at us all, as Charlie knows now, unfortunately.\u201d After his release from custody Wednesday, his lawyer told France\u2019s iTELE network that the comedian returned to performing his act at a theater in the same Paris neighborhood where Charlie Hebdo\u2019s offices are located.

Nasr al-Ansi, who had been serving as an ideological leader, was among several fighters killed in a CIA drone strike on April 21, Martin confirms. Washington considers AQAP to be the most powerful in the terrorist network. Al-Ansi's death was announced by al Qaeda operative Khaled Batarfi in a video posted on the Internet. Batarfi did not say when or where in Yemen he was killed, adding only that al-Ansi's eldest son, Mohammed, and several fighters were killed in the same airstrike. Al-Ansi, believed to have been close to al Qaeda's late leader Osama Bin Laden, has made several video appearances on behalf of the group's Yemen branch. In January, he announced that the Yemen branch was responsible for the attack on the offices of the French satirical magazine that killed 12 people. After the attacks, AQAP posted an 11-minute video on the group's Twitter account and al-Ansi warned of more \"tragedies and terror\" in the future. Al-Ansi said AQAP \"chose the target, laid out the plan and financed the operation.\" He said the radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in September 2011, had arranged the attack. Al-Ansi's death comes less than a month after AQAP announced that its top cleric, a Saudi-national who had a $5 million bounty on his head, was killed in an alleged drone attack. In late March, about 100 U.S. military advisers withdrew from the al-Annad air base where they had been leading the U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Yemen. Washington rarely comments on drone attacks. U.S. officials had been concerned their counterterrorism capabilities would be diminished because of the withdrawal of their staff. However, they said the al Qaeda branch will likely be drawn toward the internal Yemeni conflict, and away from plotting to go after Western targets.

A senior leader of the group known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), Sheikh Nasr Ben Ali al-Aanesi, claims in the video released Wednesday that AQAP ordered, planned, and funded the attack in Paris with the guidance of al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri, and in line with recommendations of his predecessor Osama bin Laden. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf says U.S. intelligence is still looking at possible links between AQAP and the Paris attackers but has determined the AQAP video is authentic. According to the video, the attack was planned as revenge for Charlie Hebdo's repeated publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Any depiction of the Prophet is contrary to Islamic law and deeply offensive to many adherents of the faith. Aanesi cited a warning from bin Laden against publishing images of the Prophet, quoting the slain al Qaeda chief directly: \"If there is no check on the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions. The answer is what you see, not what you hear.\" The video claim was released exactly a week after the attacks, and on the same day that the Charlie Hebdo staff who survived the massacre released a new edition, featuring the Prophet on the front cover. The newspaper, which usually sells about 60,000 copies, flew off shelves Wednesday morning. An initial run of 3 million copies sold out almost as soon as newsstands opened. Charlie Hebdo was reportedly to print an additional 2 million copies to meet demand. Aanesi said American-born AQAP leader Anwar al-Awlaki was the man in charge of coordinating contacts with the attackers, French-Algerian brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi. Awlaki himself was killed in a U.S. drone strike in southern Yemen in September 2011. The video did not include any images which proved the link between the Kouachi brothers and members of AQAP. However, CBS News learned on Tuesday that Said Kouachi returned from Yemen in 2011 with $20,000 to fund the operation. Witnesses to the attack in Paris said the brothers repeatedly claimed to be members of AQAP during the siege. The statement by Aanesi did not make any claims suggesting the Kouachi brothers coordinated their attack with Amedy Coulibaly, the man who shot a police officer to death the day after the Charlie Hebdo attack and then died in a police raid on a Jewish grocery store in Paris just moments after the Kouachis were killed on Friday. Coulibaly killed four hostages in the shop before the raid. Aanesi also made no explicit mention of additional members of a terror cell in France to which authorities now believe the Kouachis belonged. Police were searching for as many as six people believed to have links to the men. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said earlier this week that the manhunt was urgent because \"the threat is still present.\" U.S. intelligence officials have warned for years -- even as much of the attention in the West shifted to rival group ISIS -- that al Qaeda's Yemen branch represents the most immediate threat to the U.S. and it's allies. Cherif Kouachi had a previous arrest in France, which CBS News' Bob Orr said may have made him the more well-known of the two. But, his older brother Said may actually have had stronger ties to AQAP. Orr reported that, according to intelligence sources, Said spent \"several months\" training with the group in Yemen, at the time when Awlaki was running its operations. Awlaki was the inspiration behind Nidal Hassan's massacre at Fort Hood, and he was also behind the failed attempts to blow up a commercial airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day, 2009, and to try and hit the U.S. with bombs smuggled onto aircraft inside computer printer parts. All of those attacks relied heavily on one of AQAP's strengths; bomb making. The group in Yemen boasts one of al Qaeda's most accomplished bomb makers, Ibrahim al-Asiri, and Orr reported Wednesday that the Paris attacks could represent a change in thinking by the group, to \"settle for what's possible.\" In France, CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer says security forces are reviewing their operations over the three days of attacks and hostage-takings, and their investigation into the incidents and who was behind them is wide-ranging. In addition to the suspected members of the terror cell, police have said they're looking for a Mini Cooper car registered to Hayat Boumeddiene, the partner of Coulibaly.

The attack was years in the making, AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi said in a video, claiming U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was the mastermind behind it. Al-Awlaki was the terror group\u2019s spokesman before a U.S. drone strike killed him in Yemen in 2011. AQAP did not claim responsibility for the kosher grocery store siege but praised it. What is al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula? French security services have identified a suspected accomplice in that attack, according to the French newspaper Le Parisien. Coulibaly was killed in a police raid to end the siege. The Kouachi brothers also are dead. But investigators\u2019 efforts to track down possible suspects tied to last week\u2019s attacks are continuing. So is the magazine that the terrorists targeted last week. Charlie Hebdo\u2019s new edition hit newsstands Wednesday \u2013 a week after authorities say terrorists Said and Cherif Kouachi burst into its newsroom and gunned down staffers. New Charlie Hebdo issue on sale The cover features a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed crying. All 3 million copies sold out quickly, but more copies are coming soon, the magazine said. The claim of responsibility for the deadly attack on the magazine came in a video showing AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi, with pictures of the Kouachis in the background. \u201cWhen the heroes were assigned, they accepted. They promised and fulfilled,\u201d al-Ansi said. Who is AQAP terror group commander al-Ansi? He praised the attack, saying it was revenge for Charlie Hebdo\u2019s depictions of Mohammed. Al-Ansi blamed not only Charlie Hebdo, but also France and the United States. \u201cIt is France that has shared all of America\u2019s crimes,\u201d al-Ansi added. \u201cIt is France that has committed crimes in Mali and the Islamic Maghreb. It is France that supports the annihilation of Muslims in Central Africa in the name of race cleansing.\u201d (\u201cIslamic Maghreb\u201d refers to North Africa.) \u201cIt was a blessing from Allah\u201d that the kosher market siege, in which four hostages were killed, took place about the same time, al-Ansi said. U.S. authorities said they think the video is authentic. But they weren\u2019t ready to say that AQAP helped carry out the assault. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet. There are good indicators\u201d that the group was behind the attack, but the intelligence community is still assessing, a senior administration official told CNN. Earlier in the day, U.S. National Security Council spokesman Alistair Baskey said that, \u201cif genuine, this is only the latest example of the wanton brutality that is al Qaeda\u2019s calling card and which it has visited upon innocents of all faiths.\u201d French newspaper La Voix du Nord reports that Coulibaly also secured funds that may have been used in the attack on the kosher supermarket. Le Parisien\u2019s report said investigators identified Coulibaly\u2019s suspected accomplice using keys for a motorbike discovered in an apartment they raided over the weekend. Neighbors told CNN the apartment, in the Paris suburb of Gentilly, was raided Saturday by police. Terrorist's hideout apartment raided Also found inside the apartment, according to Le Parisien: a stash of weapons, explosives and two ISIS flags. Coulibaly purportedly told authorities before he was killed that he belonged to ISIS. Police also suspect the man may have been responsible for shooting and wounding a jogger last week \u2013 an attack that the Paris prosecutor has said could be tied to Coulibaly because the ammunition used was the same as ammunition found at the scene of the kosher market attack, Le Parisien said. Paris police would not comment to CNN on the contents of the report. Le Parisien says Coulibaly\u2019s accomplice, who the newspaper did not name, is suspected to have fled France, possibly for Syria. Officials have also said they believe Hayat Boumeddiene, Coulibaly\u2019s widow who may have played a role in the attacks, has fled to Syria. With France on its highest level of alert, 10,000 troops have deployed across the country. Thousands of police officers are on patrol, including hundreds assigned to protect Jewish schools. Since the attacks, dozens of cases have been opened in France against people accused of expressing support for terrorism, the Justice Ministry said. It\u2019s unclear how many people are blamed for the 54 infractions. The cases include investigations involving phone threats, cyberattacks and Facebook posts, the ministry said.

Nasr al-Ansi, who had been serving as an ideological leader, was among several fighters killed in a CIA drone strike on April 21, Martin confirms. Washington considers AQAP to be the most powerful in the terrorist network. Al-Ansi's death was announced by al Qaeda operative Khaled Batarfi in a video posted on the Internet. Batarfi did not say when or where in Yemen he was killed, adding only that al-Ansi's eldest son, Mohammed, and several fighters were killed in the same airstrike. Al-Ansi, believed to have been close to al Qaeda's late leader Osama Bin Laden, has made several video appearances on behalf of the group's Yemen branch. In January, he announced that the Yemen branch was responsible for the attack on the offices of the French satirical magazine that killed 12 people. After the attacks, AQAP posted an 11-minute video on the group's Twitter account and al-Ansi warned of more \"tragedies and terror\" in the future. Al-Ansi said AQAP \"chose the target, laid out the plan and financed the operation.\" He said the radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in September 2011, had arranged the attack. Al-Ansi's death comes less than a month after AQAP announced that its top cleric, a Saudi-national who had a $5 million bounty on his head, was killed in an alleged drone attack. In late March, about 100 U.S. military advisers withdrew from the al-Annad air base where they had been leading the U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Yemen. Washington rarely comments on drone attacks. U.S. officials had been concerned their counterterrorism capabilities would be diminished because of the withdrawal of their staff. However, they said the al Qaeda branch will likely be drawn toward the internal Yemeni conflict, and away from plotting to go after Western targets.

A senior leader of the group known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), Sheikh Nasr Ben Ali al-Aanesi, claims in the video released Wednesday that AQAP ordered, planned, and funded the attack in Paris with the guidance of al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahri, and in line with recommendations of his predecessor Osama bin Laden. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf says U.S. intelligence is still looking at possible links between AQAP and the Paris attackers but has determined the AQAP video is authentic. According to the video, the attack was planned as revenge for Charlie Hebdo's repeated publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Any depiction of the Prophet is contrary to Islamic law and deeply offensive to many adherents of the faith. Aanesi cited a warning from bin Laden against publishing images of the Prophet, quoting the slain al Qaeda chief directly: \"If there is no check on the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions. The answer is what you see, not what you hear.\" The video claim was released exactly a week after the attacks, and on the same day that the Charlie Hebdo staff who survived the massacre released a new edition, featuring the Prophet on the front cover. The newspaper, which usually sells about 60,000 copies, flew off shelves Wednesday morning. An initial run of 3 million copies sold out almost as soon as newsstands opened. Charlie Hebdo was reportedly to print an additional 2 million copies to meet demand. Aanesi said American-born AQAP leader Anwar al-Awlaki was the man in charge of coordinating contacts with the attackers, French-Algerian brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi. Awlaki himself was killed in a U.S. drone strike in southern Yemen in September 2011. The video did not include any images which proved the link between the Kouachi brothers and members of AQAP. However, CBS News learned on Tuesday that Said Kouachi returned from Yemen in 2011 with $20,000 to fund the operation. Witnesses to the attack in Paris said the brothers repeatedly claimed to be members of AQAP during the siege. The statement by Aanesi did not make any claims suggesting the Kouachi brothers coordinated their attack with Amedy Coulibaly, the man who shot a police officer to death the day after the Charlie Hebdo attack and then died in a police raid on a Jewish grocery store in Paris just moments after the Kouachis were killed on Friday. Coulibaly killed four hostages in the shop before the raid. Aanesi also made no explicit mention of additional members of a terror cell in France to which authorities now believe the Kouachis belonged. Police were searching for as many as six people believed to have links to the men. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said earlier this week that the manhunt was urgent because \"the threat is still present.\" U.S. intelligence officials have warned for years -- even as much of the attention in the West shifted to rival group ISIS -- that al Qaeda's Yemen branch represents the most immediate threat to the U.S. and it's allies. Cherif Kouachi had a previous arrest in France, which CBS News' Bob Orr said may have made him the more well-known of the two. But, his older brother Said may actually have had stronger ties to AQAP. Orr reported that, according to intelligence sources, Said spent \"several months\" training with the group in Yemen, at the time when Awlaki was running its operations. Awlaki was the inspiration behind Nidal Hassan's massacre at Fort Hood, and he was also behind the failed attempts to blow up a commercial airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day, 2009, and to try and hit the U.S. with bombs smuggled onto aircraft inside computer printer parts. All of those attacks relied heavily on one of AQAP's strengths; bomb making. The group in Yemen boasts one of al Qaeda's most accomplished bomb makers, Ibrahim al-Asiri, and Orr reported Wednesday that the Paris attacks could represent a change in thinking by the group, to \"settle for what's possible.\" In France, CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer says security forces are reviewing their operations over the three days of attacks and hostage-takings, and their investigation into the incidents and who was behind them is wide-ranging. In addition to the suspected members of the terror cell, police have said they're looking for a Mini Cooper car registered to Hayat Boumeddiene, the partner of Coulibaly. They are also trying to track down Boumeddiene herself, who Turkish officials\n\nquestion: Did Aanesi's statement make any claims suggesting coordination between the Kouachi brothers and Amedy Coulibaly?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1132}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.
