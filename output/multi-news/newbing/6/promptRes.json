Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Saturday: Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., enters his home in New York after running errands in his neighborhood. WASHINGTON \u2013 The second-ranking House Democrat on Sunday joined the party leadership in urging Rep. Anthony Weiner to quit because of his sexting scandal, a request the New York lawmaker has sidestepped in favor of a temporary leave of absence. The Republican Party chairman criticized Democratic leaders for not taking a more forceful stand earlier on the affair, which has overshadowed much of the legislative business on Capitol Hill over the past week. Weiner has acknowledged exchanging messages and photos, ranging from sexually suggestive to explicit, with several women online. The latest to surface appeared on the gossip website TMZ. The photos posted Sunday were purportedly taken in the House members' gym and show a shirtless Weiner with a towel around his waist and his hand on his crotch. In one photo he is naked and holding the towel over his crotch. TMZ said the photos were sent online to at least one woman. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, spoke of Weiner's \"bizarre and unacceptable behavior\" in sending inappropriate pictures of himself to young women. Hoyer said it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for Weiner to continue to represent his constituents effectively. In New York, foes and supporters of Weiner confronted each other. \"He's not fit to be our congressman,\" said Jim Scott, 61, one of about two dozen constituents who rallied in front of Weiner's office in the Kew Gardens section of Queens. \"People are sick of him, especially his attitude.\" Half a dozen Weiner supporters gathered a few yards away. College student Olivia Lurrie, 18, said Weiner was a good leader who made a mistake. Weiner announced Saturday that he was entering professional treatment at an undisclosed location and wanted a leave of absence from Congress. A statement from an aide did not say where he would receive treatment or what type was involved. That announcement came right after House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the national party head, said Weiner must go. Weiner said at news conference last Monday that he had lied in previously saying that he had not sent any photos. Pelosi immediately called for an ethics committee investigation. But it was not until the weekend that leaders said he should step down. Hoyer said the ethics committee process to decide if Weiner had committed an expellable offense would take time and \"I really don't know if we have that time.\" He said he didn't see how Weiner could stay in office. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Weiner should resign. \"We've got important work to do and this is a ridiculous distraction,\" he said in an appearance with Hoyer on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS. Lawmakers marching Sunday in New York's Puerto Rican Day parade were less demanding. \"I think it could have been handled better,\" Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said when asked whether he stood with Pelosi in calling for Weiner's resignation. Rangel, who was censured by the House last year for ethics violations, was also asked if he thought it was a good idea for Weiner to take time off to enter treatment. \"He is the one that knows the best, he and his wife,\" Rangel responded. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., declined to comment any further, saying, \"Those of us who have been longtime friends of Anthony are heartbroken, and I'm just going to try to enjoy the parade today.\" On NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus criticized Pelosi and other Democrats for not acting sooner. \"It seemed to me that for the first 10 days in this circus... the only job that Nancy Pelosi was interested in saving was Anthony Weiner's,\" he said. That drew a sharp retort from Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who accused Republicans of a double standard. She said that Republican leaders didn't call for the resignation of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., when he got caught up in a prostitution scandal, and that Priebus had not publicly sought the resignation of former Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., who stepped down this year over an affair with a staffer's wife. Wasserman Schultz said party officials initially gave Weiner \"some breathing room\" to reach the conclusion that he needed to step down on his own, but decided to toughen their stance Saturday after it became apparent he would not do so. David B. Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Akron, said Sunday: \"Had Anthony Weiner not been a rising star in the party and such a hero to progressives,\n\nquestion: What did President Barack Obama describe Weiner's behavior as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1120}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

But the fact that he is a national figure that has a national base of support bought him some time.\" A leave of absence may be Weiner's only chance to rehabilitate his career, Cohen said. \"Remorse isn't going to cut it in this case.

Anthony Weiner of New York to resign following his admission of risqu\u00e9 online exchanges and lying about them. Pennsylvania Rep. Allyson Schwartz, a top Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee official, called Weiner's behavior \"offensive\" and said that he should resign. \"Having the respect of your constituents is fundamental for a member of Congress,\" she said in an interview with Politico. Schwartz joins a handful of other sitting Democrats, including Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Patrick Leahy of Vermont, and former DNC chairman Tim Kaine in calling for Weiner to step down. Top Republicans, including RNC chairman Reince Preibus and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, have also said Weiner should go. But some observers say the message to Weiner is hypocritical and politically motivated, given both public opinion polling showing that a majority of New Yorkers think Weiner should stay and the fact that Weiner has not been accused of breaking the law or convicted of violating any House rules. \"This is a massive overreaction and I don't understand it,\" said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Sloan pointed to the recent ethics case of another New York congressman, Charles Rangel, as an example of the double standard being pushed by some Democrats for Weiner. The House Ethics Committee found Rangel -- the former chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, which writes the nation's tax laws -- guilty of improper fundraising, inappropriate possession of multiple rent-controlled apartments and failure to pay taxes on a vacation home, among other charges. \"There were very few calls on Rangel to resign and he was censured of serious misconduct involving his office \u2013 really serious things that had potential for criminal charges,\" Sloan said. \"We don't have anything remotely like that in the Weiner case.\" Sloan explained that the mounting pressure on Weiner may stem in part from the early precedent set by House Speaker John Boehner when, at the first sign of sexual misconduct, he urged Reps. Mark Souder (R-Ind.) and Chris Lee (R-N.Y.) to resign, even though their behavior didn't appear to involve any abuse of their office. \"A lot of people really hate Weiner, too,\" she said, referring to Weiner's colleagues in the House, some of whom are said to have been rankled by his personality and frequent media appearances. As for Weiner's bald lies to his family, constituents and the general public in media appearances last week about the lewd photo that appeared on Twitter, Sloan said it was disconcerting and tarnished his credibility but not the worst Washington has seen. \"A politician lying is not that unusual,\" Sloan said. \"If the new standard is that politicians are out the second they lie to us, then a lot of politicians could be gone.\" The Senate Ethics Committee last month concluded that Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) tried to cover up a sex scandal with the wife of his former top aide, made false statements to the Federal Election Commission, and violated campaign finance laws. Ensign, who remained in office during the monthslong investigation, abruptly resigned before the findings were released. The committee later referred the case to both the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\nquestion: What did President Barack Obama describe Weiner's behavior as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 785}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

'Special Report' All-Star panel weighs in Anthony Weiner shrugged off calls Wednesday to withdraw from the New York City mayoral race over a new sexting scandal, despite criticism from old colleagues, media calls for him to step down and newly released poll figures that gave him a moral character rating of 17 percent. Weiner told reporters Wednesday night that while the uproar of recent days had \"been rough,\" he felt \"these are things I brought upon myself.\" He added he was \"pressing forward.\" The ex-congressman was greeted with boos as he took the stage at a public housing meeting earlier Wednesday evening, the Associated Press reported.. But by the end of his remarks, the crowd loudly cheered. Even former Democratic congressional colleagues said enough is enough. Rep. Jerrold Nadler said Wednesday: \"I think he should pull out of the race. I think he needs serious psychiatric help.\" Rep. Joseph Crowley said New Yorkers are \"tired of the drama\" surrounding Weiner. And Rep. Charles Rangel said he believes the voters will put an end to Weiner's ambitions. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday afternoon that surveyed likely New York City Democratic voters from July 18-23 -- news of Weiner's latest indiscretions broke on the last day -- gave him a 17 percent score for moral character, 57 percent for experience and 51 percent for understanding. It also put him in first place, with 26 percent of the vote, in the first round of the Democratic primary but in the event of a runoff, the poll says he would finish behind former city comptroller William Thompson. The New York Post Wednesday reported Weiner had released an \"open letter\" in which he said sending the lewd texts and photos were \"a terrible mistake that I unfortunately returned to during a rough time\" in his marriage to wife Huma Abedin. Weiner Tuesday admitted sending a woman sexually explicit photos and messages and acknowledged the activity took place as recently as last summer, more than a year after he resigned from the House in June 2011 for the same sort of behavior with at least a half-dozen women. With Abedin standing an arm's length away from him, Weiner told a hastily called news conference he would stay in the race despite the new onslaught of negative publicity. \"I want to bring my vision to the people of the city of New York. I hope they are willing to still continue to give me a second chance,\" Weiner said. In an editorial posted online Tuesday, the New York Times urged Weiner to drop out of the race, saying Weiner \"should take his marital troubles and personal compulsions out of the public eye, away from cameras, off the Web and out of the race for mayor of New York City.\" Three of his rivals for mayor \u2014 Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and former City Councilman Sal Albanese, both Democrats, and billionaire John Catsimatidis, a Republican \u2014 also called on Weiner to quit the race. \"Enough is enough,\" de Blasio said. \"The sideshows of this election have gotten in the way of the debate we should be having about the future of this city.\" Another mayoral hopeful, city Comptroller John Liu, stopped short of calling for Weiner to bow out, but suggested his \"propensity for pornographic selfies is a valid issue for voters.\" The other leading Democratic candidates, including City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Thompson, did not immediately comment. The congressman fessed up to the naughty texts after sexually explicit photos and online chats between \"Carlos Danger,\" allegedly the pseudonym for the city hall hopeful, and an unidentified woman surfaced on the blog, TheDirty.com. The reports claim that that the conversation between the pol and an unidentified 23-year-old woman took place on the social media website Formspring in August 2012, a year after he resigned from his post in Congress after being caught the first time \u2014 and nearly seven months after his first child with wife Abedin was born. The woman claims on the blog that she first started talking online with Weiner in July 2012 and it became intense by August 2012, when he offered to find a Chicago condo where they could meet up. She also alleges that they had phone sex and that they exchanged nude photos of each other. She claims she received photos from Weiner of his penis sent from a Yahoo email account under the \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d name. The purported image was subsequently posted on TheDirty.com. Buzzfeed.com later reported that a source close to the matter said Weiner exchanged the explicit messages and photos with a woman named Sydney Elaine Leathers in late July of last year. The website characterized Leathers as a \"progressive activist\" from Indiana.

It's unclear how the lewd news will impact Weiner's campaign. Some New Yorkers have shown a willingness to forgive his past indiscretions since he announced his mayoral campaign via YouTube in May.

WASHINGTON \u2013 The second-ranking House Democrat on Sunday joined the party leadership in urging Rep. Anthony Weiner to quit because of his sexting scandal, a request the New York lawmaker has sidestepped in favor of a temporary leave of absence. The Republican Party chairman criticized Democratic leaders for not taking a more forceful stand earlier on the affair, which has overshadowed much of the legislative business on Capitol Hill over the past week. Weiner has acknowledged exchanging messages and photos, ranging from sexually suggestive to explicit, with several women online. The latest to surface appeared on the gossip website TMZ. The photos posted Sunday were purportedly taken in the House members' gym and show a shirtless Weiner with a towel around his waist and his hand on his crotch. In one photo he is naked and holding the towel over his crotch. TMZ said the photos were sent online to at least one woman. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, spoke of Weiner's \"bizarre and unacceptable behavior\" in sending inappropriate pictures of himself to young women. Hoyer said it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for Weiner to continue to represent his constituents effectively. In New York, foes and supporters of Weiner confronted each other. \"He's not fit to be our congressman,\" said Jim Scott, 61, one of about two dozen constituents who rallied in front of Weiner's office in the Kew Gardens section of Queens. \"People are sick of him, especially his attitude.\" Half a dozen Weiner supporters gathered a few yards away. College student Olivia Lurrie, 18, said Weiner was a good leader who made a mistake. Weiner announced Saturday that he was entering professional treatment at an undisclosed location and wanted a leave of absence from Congress. A statement from an aide did not say where he would receive treatment or what type was involved. That announcement came right after House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the national party head, said Weiner must go. Weiner said at news conference last Monday that he had lied in previously saying that he had not sent any photos. Pelosi immediately called for an ethics committee investigation. But it was not until the weekend that leaders said he should step down. Hoyer said the ethics committee process to decide if Weiner had committed an expellable offense would take time and \"I really don't know if we have that time.\" He said he didn't see how Weiner could stay in office. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Weiner should resign. \"We've got important work to do and this is a ridiculous distraction,\" he said in an appearance with Hoyer on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS. Lawmakers marching Sunday in New York's Puerto Rican Day parade were less demanding. \"I think it could have been handled better,\" Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said when asked whether he stood with Pelosi in calling for Weiner's resignation. Rangel, who was censured by the House last year for ethics violations, was also asked if he thought it was a good idea for Weiner to take time off to enter treatment. \"He is the one that knows the best, he and his wife,\" Rangel responded. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., declined to comment any further, saying, \"Those of us who have been longtime friends of Anthony are heartbroken, and I'm just going to try to enjoy the parade today.\" On NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus criticized Pelosi and other Democrats for not acting sooner. \"It seemed to me that for the first 10 days in this circus... the only job that Nancy Pelosi was interested in saving was Anthony Weiner's,\" he said. That drew a sharp retort from Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who accused Republicans of a double standard. She said that Republican leaders didn't call for the resignation of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., when he got caught up in a prostitution scandal, and that Priebus had not publicly sought the resignation of former Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., who stepped down this year over an affair with a staffer's wife. Wasserman Schultz said party officials initially gave Weiner \"some breathing room\" to reach the conclusion that he needed to step down on his own, but decided to toughen their stance Saturday after it became apparent he would not do so. David B. Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Akron, said Sunday: \"Had Anthony Weiner not been a rising star in the party and such a hero to progressives,\n\nquestion: Who was under pressure to resign?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Rep.

The House Ethics Committee found Rangel -- the former chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, which writes the nation's tax laws -- guilty of improper fundraising, inappropriate possession of multiple rent-controlled apartments and failure to pay taxes on a vacation home, among other charges. \"There were very few calls on Rangel to resign and he was censured of serious misconduct involving his office \u2013 really serious things that had potential for criminal charges,\" Sloan said. \"We don't have anything remotely like that in the Weiner case.\" Sloan explained that the mounting pressure on Weiner may stem in part from the early precedent set by House Speaker John Boehner when, at the first sign of sexual misconduct, he urged Reps. Mark Souder (R-Ind.) and Chris Lee (R-N.Y.) to resign, even though their behavior didn't appear to involve any abuse of their office. \"A lot of people really hate Weiner, too,\" she said, referring to Weiner's colleagues in the House, some of whom are said to have been rankled by his personality and frequent media appearances. As for Weiner's bald lies to his family, constituents and the general public in media appearances last week about the lewd photo that appeared on Twitter, Sloan said it was disconcerting and tarnished his credibility but not the worst Washington has seen. \"A politician lying is not that unusual,\" Sloan said. \"If the new standard is that politicians are out the second they lie to us, then a lot of politicians could be gone.\" The Senate Ethics Committee last month concluded that Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) tried to cover up a sex scandal with the wife of his former top aide, made false statements to the Federal Election Commission, and violated campaign finance laws. Ensign, who remained in office during the monthslong investigation, abruptly resigned before the findings were released.

'Special Report' All-Star panel weighs in Anthony Weiner shrugged off calls Wednesday to withdraw from the New York City mayoral race over a new sexting scandal, despite criticism from old colleagues, media calls for him to step down and newly released poll figures that gave him a moral character rating of 17 percent. Weiner told reporters Wednesday night that while the uproar of recent days had \"been rough,\" he felt \"these are things I brought upon myself.\" He added he was \"pressing forward.\" The ex-congressman was greeted with boos as he took the stage at a public housing meeting earlier Wednesday evening, the Associated Press reported.. But by the end of his remarks, the crowd loudly cheered. Even former Democratic congressional colleagues said enough is enough. Rep. Jerrold Nadler said Wednesday: \"I think he should pull out of the race. I think he needs serious psychiatric help.\" Rep. Joseph Crowley said New Yorkers are \"tired of the drama\" surrounding Weiner. And Rep. Charles Rangel said he believes the voters will put an end to Weiner's ambitions. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday afternoon that surveyed likely New York City Democratic voters from July 18-23 -- news of Weiner's latest indiscretions broke on the last day -- gave him a 17 percent score for moral character, 57 percent for experience and 51 percent for understanding. It also put him in first place, with 26 percent of the vote, in the first round of the Democratic primary but in the event of a runoff, the poll says he would finish behind former city comptroller William Thompson. The New York Post Wednesday reported Weiner had released an \"open letter\" in which he said sending the lewd texts and photos were \"a terrible mistake that I unfortunately returned to during a rough time\" in his marriage to wife Huma Abedin. Weiner Tuesday admitted sending a woman sexually explicit photos and messages and acknowledged the activity took place as recently as last summer, more than a year after he resigned from the House in June 2011 for the same sort of behavior with at least a half-dozen women. With Abedin standing an arm's length away from him, Weiner told a hastily called news conference he would stay in the race despite the new onslaught of negative publicity. \"I want to bring my vision to the people of the city of New York. I hope they are willing to still continue to give me a second chance,\" Weiner said. In an editorial posted online Tuesday, the New York Times urged Weiner to drop out of the race, saying Weiner \"should take his marital troubles and personal compulsions out of the public eye, away from cameras, off the Web and out of the race for mayor of New York City.\" Three of his rivals for mayor \u2014 Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and former City Councilman Sal Albanese, both Democrats, and billionaire John Catsimatidis, a Republican \u2014 also called on Weiner to quit the race. \"Enough is enough,\" de Blasio said. \"The sideshows of this election have gotten in the way of the debate we should be having about the future of this city.\" Another mayoral hopeful, city Comptroller John Liu, stopped short of calling for Weiner to bow out, but suggested his \"propensity for pornographic selfies is a valid issue for voters.\" The other leading Democratic candidates, including City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Thompson, did not immediately comment. The congressman fessed up to the naughty texts after sexually explicit photos and online chats between \"Carlos Danger,\" allegedly the pseudonym for the city hall hopeful, and an unidentified woman surfaced on the blog, TheDirty.com. The reports claim that that the conversation between the pol and an unidentified 23-year-old woman took place on the social media website Formspring in August 2012, a year after he resigned from his post in Congress after being caught the first time \u2014 and nearly seven months after his first child with wife Abedin was born. The woman claims on the blog that she first started talking online with Weiner in July 2012 and it became intense by August 2012, when he offered to find a Chicago condo where they could meet up. She also alleges that they had phone sex and that they exchanged nude photos of each other. She claims she received photos from Weiner of his penis sent from a Yahoo email account under the \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d name. The purported image was subsequently posted on TheDirty.com.

WASHINGTON \u2013 The second-ranking House Democrat on Sunday joined the party leadership in urging Rep. Anthony Weiner to quit because of his sexting scandal, a request the New York lawmaker has sidestepped in favor of a temporary leave of absence. The Republican Party chairman criticized Democratic leaders for not taking a more forceful stand earlier on the affair, which has overshadowed much of the legislative business on Capitol Hill over the past week. Weiner has acknowledged exchanging messages and photos, ranging from sexually suggestive to explicit, with several women online. The latest to surface appeared on the gossip website TMZ. The photos posted Sunday were purportedly taken in the House members' gym and show a shirtless Weiner with a towel around his waist and his hand on his crotch. In one photo he is naked and holding the towel over his crotch. TMZ said the photos were sent online to at least one woman. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, spoke of Weiner's \"bizarre and unacceptable behavior\" in sending inappropriate pictures of himself to young women. Hoyer said it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for Weiner to continue to represent his constituents effectively. In New York, foes and supporters of Weiner confronted each other. \"He's not fit to be our congressman,\" said Jim Scott, 61, one of about two dozen constituents who rallied in front of Weiner's office in the Kew Gardens section of Queens. \"People are sick of him, especially his attitude.\" Half a dozen Weiner supporters gathered a few yards away. College student Olivia Lurrie, 18, said Weiner was a good leader who made a mistake. Weiner announced Saturday that he was entering professional treatment at an undisclosed location and wanted a leave of absence from Congress. A statement from an aide did not say where he would receive treatment or what type was involved. That announcement came right after House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the national party head, said Weiner must go. Weiner said at news conference last Monday that he had lied in previously saying that he had not sent any photos. Pelosi immediately called for an ethics committee investigation. But it was not until the weekend that leaders said he should step down. Hoyer said the ethics committee process to decide if Weiner had committed an expellable offense would take time and \"I really don't know if we have that time.\" He said he didn't see how Weiner could stay in office. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Weiner should resign. \"We've got important work to do and this is a ridiculous distraction,\" he said in an appearance with Hoyer on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS. Lawmakers marching Sunday in New York's Puerto Rican Day parade were less demanding. \"I think it could have been handled better,\" Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said when asked whether he stood with Pelosi in calling for Weiner's resignation. Rangel, who was censured by the House last year for ethics violations, was also asked if he thought it was a good idea for Weiner to take time off to enter treatment. \"He is the one that knows the best, he and his wife,\" Rangel responded. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., declined to comment any further, saying, \"Those of us who have been longtime friends of Anthony are heartbroken, and I'm just going to try to enjoy the parade today.\" On NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus criticized Pelosi and other Democrats for not acting sooner. \"It seemed to me that for the first 10 days in this circus... the only job that Nancy Pelosi was interested in saving was Anthony Weiner's,\" he said. That drew a sharp retort from Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who accused Republicans of a double standard. She said that Republican leaders didn't call for the resignation of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., when he got caught up in a prostitution scandal, and that Priebus had not publicly sought the resignation of former Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., who stepped down this year over an affair with a staffer's wife. Wasserman Schultz said party officials initially gave Weiner \"some breathing room\" to reach the conclusion that he needed to step down on his own, but decided to toughen their stance Saturday after it became apparent he would not do so. David B. Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Akron, said Sunday: \"Had Anthony Weiner not been a rising star in the party and such a hero to progressives,\n\nquestion: Who urged Weiner to quit?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Rep.

In light of Anthony Weiner\u2019s offensive behavior... he should resign,\u201d Schwartz said. But Howard Witz, a real estate broker in Brooklyn, part of Weiner\u2019s district in New York City, said he would support Weiner again should he stay in politics. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame because he\u2019s a very effective politician,\u201d Witz said. \u201cDisappointed? Maybe. But does it make me quit on him? No it doesn\u2019t. As long as he didn\u2019t commit a crime.\u201d Another New Yorker, Joe Mele, was blunter in talking about Weiner, who has voiced ambitions to run for mayor of New York in 2013. \u201cMayor? I don\u2019t think he should be dogcatcher,\u201d Mele said. Weiner, married to a longtime aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, acknowledged on Monday he had inappropriate Internet and telephone conversations with six women. But the 46-year-old lawmaker said he had broken no law and would not resign.  Dan Ripp of Bradley Woods, a private firm that tracks Washington for investors, said he expected Weiner to quit within days. \u201cI think he\u2019s history,\u201d Ripp said. \u201cDemocrats aren\u2019t giving him the time of day. He has no clout. His own party is looking at him like a bozo. He is dragging them down.\u201d A little more than half of New York City voters think Weiner should remain in office, according to a NY1-Marist poll taken just hours after his tearful admission. But a majority, 56 percent, say he should give up his hopes of becoming the next New York mayor. Actor Alec Baldwin, long thought to be considering a political career, may jump into the race. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule it out,\u201d his publicist Matthew Hiltzik said, responding to a report in The Daily online publication, which reported that the star of television\u2019s \u201c30 Rock\u201d believed the Weiner scandal had improved his chances to become mayor. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has asked the House Ethics Committee to investigate whether Weiner violated any of the chamber\u2019s rules. House Republican Leader Eric Cantor on Tuesday became the first top U.S. lawmaker to say Weiner should step down, saying Congress was too busy with other matters to deal with Weiner\u2019s tweets. Former Democratic Party Chairman Tim Kaine, now running for the Senate from Virginia, also called on Weiner to step down. \u201cLying is unforgivable, public lying about something like this is unforgivable. He should resign,\u201d Kaine told a television station on Tuesday in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Obama's comments were his first remarks on the lurid scandal, in which Weiner first denied and later admitted exchanging lewd photographs and online messages with several women he had met through social media. \"I think he's embarrassed himself. He's acknowledged that. He's embarrassed his wife and his family. Ultimately, there's gonna be a decision for him and his constituents. I can tell you that, if it was me, I would resign,\" Obama said in the interview. \"When you get to the point where, because of various personal distractions, you can't serve as effectively as you need to at the time when people are worrying about jobs, and their mortgages, and paying the bills, then you should probably step back.\" On Monday the House of Representatives unanimously granted Weiner's request for a two week leave of absence. Before Obama's comments, other senior Democrats had called on Weiner to quit over the weekend, including the Democratic leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, and the influential chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Steve Israel, who called Weiner's scandal \"an insurmountable distraction\". So far Weiner has maintained that he will stay in office, and there is little the Democratic heirarchy can do to force him out, other than strip him of his spot of the House's powerful energy and commerce committee. Republicans in Congress have been pressing the Democratic leadership to expel Weiner, but Pelosi said in a statement: \"None of us, not anybody here, has the power to force somebody out of office. That person has to decide himself as to whether he will stay or he will go.\" Weiner has said that he would not resign without talking to his wife, Huma Abedin, herself an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Abedin is expected to return from a trip overseas on Tuesday.\n\nquestion: Who urged Weiner to quit?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Steve Israel", "usage": 559}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Anthony Weiner of New York to resign following his admission of risqu\u00e9 online exchanges and lying about them. Pennsylvania Rep. Allyson Schwartz, a top Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee official, called Weiner's behavior \"offensive\" and said that he should resign. \"Having the respect of your constituents is fundamental for a member of Congress,\" she said in an interview with Politico. Schwartz joins a handful of other sitting Democrats, including Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Patrick Leahy of Vermont, and former DNC chairman Tim Kaine in calling for Weiner to step down. Top Republicans, including RNC chairman Reince Preibus and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, have also said Weiner should go. But some observers say the message to Weiner is hypocritical and politically motivated, given both public opinion polling showing that a majority of New Yorkers think Weiner should stay and the fact that Weiner has not been accused of breaking the law or convicted of violating any House rules. \"This is a massive overreaction and I don't understand it,\" said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

WASHINGTON \u2013 The second-ranking House Democrat on Sunday joined the party leadership in urging Rep. Anthony Weiner to quit because of his sexting scandal, a request the New York lawmaker has sidestepped in favor of a temporary leave of absence. The Republican Party chairman criticized Democratic leaders for not taking a more forceful stand earlier on the affair, which has overshadowed much of the legislative business on Capitol Hill over the past week. Weiner has acknowledged exchanging messages and photos, ranging from sexually suggestive to explicit, with several women online. The latest to surface appeared on the gossip website TMZ. The photos posted Sunday were purportedly taken in the House members' gym and show a shirtless Weiner with a towel around his waist and his hand on his crotch. In one photo he is naked and holding the towel over his crotch. TMZ said the photos were sent online to at least one woman. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, spoke of Weiner's \"bizarre and unacceptable behavior\" in sending inappropriate pictures of himself to young women. Hoyer said it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for Weiner to continue to represent his constituents effectively. In New York, foes and supporters of Weiner confronted each other. \"He's not fit to be our congressman,\" said Jim Scott, 61, one of about two dozen constituents who rallied in front of Weiner's office in the Kew Gardens section of Queens. \"People are sick of him, especially his attitude.\" Half a dozen Weiner supporters gathered a few yards away. College student Olivia Lurrie, 18, said Weiner was a good leader who made a mistake. Weiner announced Saturday that he was entering professional treatment at an undisclosed location and wanted a leave of absence from Congress. A statement from an aide did not say where he would receive treatment or what type was involved. That announcement came right after House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the national party head, said Weiner must go. Weiner said at news conference last Monday that he had lied in previously saying that he had not sent any photos. Pelosi immediately called for an ethics committee investigation. But it was not until the weekend that leaders said he should step down. Hoyer said the ethics committee process to decide if Weiner had committed an expellable offense would take time and \"I really don't know if we have that time.\" He said he didn't see how Weiner could stay in office. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Weiner should resign. \"We've got important work to do and this is a ridiculous distraction,\" he said in an appearance with Hoyer on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS. Lawmakers marching Sunday in New York's Puerto Rican Day parade were less demanding. \"I think it could have been handled better,\" Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said when asked whether he stood with Pelosi in calling for Weiner's resignation. Rangel, who was censured by the House last year for ethics violations, was also asked if he thought it was a good idea for Weiner to take time off to enter treatment. \"He is the one that knows the best, he and his wife,\" Rangel responded. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., declined to comment any further, saying, \"Those of us who have been longtime friends of Anthony are heartbroken, and I'm just going to try to enjoy the parade today.\" On NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus criticized Pelosi and other Democrats for not acting sooner. \"It seemed to me that for the first 10 days in this circus... the only job that Nancy Pelosi was interested in saving was Anthony Weiner's,\" he said. That drew a sharp retort from Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who accused Republicans of a double standard. She said that Republican leaders didn't call for the resignation of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., when he got caught up in a prostitution scandal, and that Priebus had not publicly sought the resignation of former Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., who stepped down this year over an affair with a staffer's wife. Wasserman Schultz said party officials initially gave Weiner \"some breathing room\" to reach the conclusion that he needed to step down on his own, but decided to toughen their stance Saturday after it became apparent he would not do so.

In light of Anthony Weiner\u2019s offensive behavior... he should resign,\u201d Schwartz said. But Howard Witz, a real estate broker in Brooklyn, part of Weiner\u2019s district in New York City, said he would support Weiner again should he stay in politics. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame because he\u2019s a very effective politician,\u201d Witz said. \u201cDisappointed? Maybe. But does it make me quit on him? No it doesn\u2019t. As long as he didn\u2019t commit a crime.\u201d Another New Yorker, Joe Mele, was blunter in talking about Weiner, who has voiced ambitions to run for mayor of New York in 2013. \u201cMayor? I don\u2019t think he should be dogcatcher,\u201d Mele said. Weiner, married to a longtime aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, acknowledged on Monday he had inappropriate Internet and telephone conversations with six women. But the 46-year-old lawmaker said he had broken no law and would not resign.  Dan Ripp of Bradley Woods, a private firm that tracks Washington for investors, said he expected Weiner to quit within days. \u201cI think he\u2019s history,\u201d Ripp said. \u201cDemocrats aren\u2019t giving him the time of day. He has no clout. His own party is looking at him like a bozo. He is dragging them down.\u201d A little more than half of New York City voters think Weiner should remain in office, according to a NY1-Marist poll taken just hours after his tearful admission. But a majority, 56 percent, say he should give up his hopes of becoming the next New York mayor. Actor Alec Baldwin, long thought to be considering a political career, may jump into the race. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule it out,\u201d his publicist Matthew Hiltzik said, responding to a report in The Daily online publication, which reported that the star of television\u2019s \u201c30 Rock\u201d believed the Weiner scandal had improved his chances to become mayor. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has asked the House Ethics Committee to investigate whether Weiner violated any of the chamber\u2019s rules. House Republican Leader Eric Cantor on Tuesday became the first top U.S. lawmaker to say Weiner should step down, saying Congress was too busy with other matters to deal with Weiner\u2019s tweets. Former Democratic Party Chairman Tim Kaine, now running for the Senate from Virginia, also called on Weiner to step down. \u201cLying is unforgivable, public lying about something like this is unforgivable. He should resign,\u201d Kaine told a television station on Tuesday in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Obama's comments were his first remarks on the lurid scandal, in which Weiner first denied and later admitted exchanging lewd photographs and online messages with several women he had met through social media. \"I think he's embarrassed himself. He's acknowledged that. He's embarrassed his wife and his family. Ultimately, there's gonna be a decision for him and his constituents. I can tell you that, if it was me, I would resign,\" Obama said in the interview. \"When you get to the point where, because of various personal distractions, you can't serve as effectively as you need to at the time when people are worrying about jobs, and their mortgages, and paying the bills, then you should probably step back.\" On Monday the House of Representatives unanimously granted Weiner's request for a two week leave of absence. Before Obama's comments, other senior Democrats had called on Weiner to quit over the weekend, including the Democratic leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, and the influential chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Steve Israel, who called Weiner's scandal \"an insurmountable distraction\". So far Weiner has maintained that he will stay in office, and there is little the Democratic heirarchy can do to force him out, other than strip him of his spot of the House's powerful energy and commerce committee. Republicans in Congress have been pressing the Democratic leadership to expel Weiner, but Pelosi said in a statement: \"None of us, not anybody here, has the power to force somebody out of office. That person has to decide himself as to whether he will stay or he will go.\" Weiner has said that he would not resign without talking to his wife, Huma Abedin, herself an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Abedin is expected to return from a trip overseas on Tuesday.\n\nquestion: What was Weiner's behavior described as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "\"highly inappropriate\"", "usage": 557}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Anthony Weiner of New York to resign following his admission of risqu\u00e9 online exchanges and lying about them. Pennsylvania Rep. Allyson Schwartz, a top Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee official, called Weiner's behavior \"offensive\" and said that he should resign. \"Having the respect of your constituents is fundamental for a member of Congress,\" she said in an interview with Politico. Schwartz joins a handful of other sitting Democrats, including Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Patrick Leahy of Vermont, and former DNC chairman Tim Kaine in calling for Weiner to step down. Top Republicans, including RNC chairman Reince Preibus and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, have also said Weiner should go. But some observers say the message to Weiner is hypocritical and politically motivated, given both public opinion polling showing that a majority of New Yorkers think Weiner should stay and the fact that Weiner has not been accused of breaking the law or convicted of violating any House rules. \"This is a massive overreaction and I don't understand it,\" said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Sloan pointed to the recent ethics case of another New York congressman, Charles Rangel, as an example of the double standard being pushed by some Democrats for Weiner. The House Ethics Committee found Rangel -- the former chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, which writes the nation's tax laws -- guilty of improper fundraising, inappropriate possession of multiple rent-controlled apartments and failure to pay taxes on a vacation home, among other charges. \"There were very few calls on Rangel to resign and he was censured of serious misconduct involving his office \u2013 really serious things that had potential for criminal charges,\" Sloan said. \"We don't have anything remotely like that in the Weiner case.\" Sloan explained that the mounting pressure on Weiner may stem in part from the early precedent set by House Speaker John Boehner when, at the first sign of sexual misconduct, he urged Reps. Mark Souder (R-Ind.) and Chris Lee (R-N.Y.) to resign, even though their behavior didn't appear to involve any abuse of their office. \"A lot of people really hate Weiner, too,\" she said, referring to Weiner's colleagues in the House, some of whom are said to have been rankled by his personality and frequent media appearances. As for Weiner's bald lies to his family, constituents and the general public in media appearances last week about the lewd photo that appeared on Twitter, Sloan said it was disconcerting and tarnished his credibility but not the worst Washington has seen. \"A politician lying is not that unusual,\" Sloan said. \"If the new standard is that politicians are out the second they lie to us, then a lot of politicians could be gone.\" The Senate Ethics Committee last month concluded that Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) tried to cover up a sex scandal with the wife of his former top aide, made false statements to the Federal Election Commission, and violated campaign finance laws. Ensign, who remained in office during the monthslong investigation, abruptly resigned before the findings were released. The committee later referred the case to both the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\nquestion: What was Weiner's behavior described as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "offensive", "usage": 782}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

'Special Report' All-Star panel weighs in Anthony Weiner shrugged off calls Wednesday to withdraw from the New York City mayoral race over a new sexting scandal, despite criticism from old colleagues, media calls for him to step down and newly released poll figures that gave him a moral character rating of 17 percent. Weiner told reporters Wednesday night that while the uproar of recent days had \"been rough,\" he felt \"these are things I brought upon myself.\" He added he was \"pressing forward.\" The ex-congressman was greeted with boos as he took the stage at a public housing meeting earlier Wednesday evening, the Associated Press reported.. But by the end of his remarks, the crowd loudly cheered. Even former Democratic congressional colleagues said enough is enough. Rep. Jerrold Nadler said Wednesday: \"I think he should pull out of the race. I think he needs serious psychiatric help.\" Rep. Joseph Crowley said New Yorkers are \"tired of the drama\" surrounding Weiner. And Rep. Charles Rangel said he believes the voters will put an end to Weiner's ambitions. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday afternoon that surveyed likely New York City Democratic voters from July 18-23 -- news of Weiner's latest indiscretions broke on the last day -- gave him a 17 percent score for moral character, 57 percent for experience and 51 percent for understanding. It also put him in first place, with 26 percent of the vote, in the first round of the Democratic primary but in the event of a runoff, the poll says he would finish behind former city comptroller William Thompson. The New York Post Wednesday reported Weiner had released an \"open letter\" in which he said sending the lewd texts and photos were \"a terrible mistake that I unfortunately returned to during a rough time\" in his marriage to wife Huma Abedin. Weiner Tuesday admitted sending a woman sexually explicit photos and messages and acknowledged the activity took place as recently as last summer, more than a year after he resigned from the House in June 2011 for the same sort of behavior with at least a half-dozen women. With Abedin standing an arm's length away from him, Weiner told a hastily called news conference he would stay in the race despite the new onslaught of negative publicity. \"I want to bring my vision to the people of the city of New York. I hope they are willing to still continue to give me a second chance,\" Weiner said. In an editorial posted online Tuesday, the New York Times urged Weiner to drop out of the race, saying Weiner \"should take his marital troubles and personal compulsions out of the public eye, away from cameras, off the Web and out of the race for mayor of New York City.\" Three of his rivals for mayor \u2014 Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and former City Councilman Sal Albanese, both Democrats, and billionaire John Catsimatidis, a Republican \u2014 also called on Weiner to quit the race. \"Enough is enough,\" de Blasio said. \"The sideshows of this election have gotten in the way of the debate we should be having about the future of this city.\" Another mayoral hopeful, city Comptroller John Liu, stopped short of calling for Weiner to bow out, but suggested his \"propensity for pornographic selfies is a valid issue for voters.\" The other leading Democratic candidates, including City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Thompson, did not immediately comment. The congressman fessed up to the naughty texts after sexually explicit photos and online chats between \"Carlos Danger,\" allegedly the pseudonym for the city hall hopeful, and an unidentified woman surfaced on the blog, TheDirty.com. The reports claim that that the conversation between the pol and an unidentified 23-year-old woman took place on the social media website Formspring in August 2012, a year after he resigned from his post in Congress after being caught the first time \u2014 and nearly seven months after his first child with wife Abedin was born. The woman claims on the blog that she first started talking online with Weiner in July 2012 and it became intense by August 2012, when he offered to find a Chicago condo where they could meet up. She also alleges that they had phone sex and that they exchanged nude photos of each other. She claims she received photos from Weiner of his penis sent from a Yahoo email account under the \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d name. The purported image was subsequently posted on TheDirty.com. Buzzfeed.com later reported that a source close to the matter said Weiner exchanged the explicit messages and photos with a woman named Sydney Elaine Leathers in late July of last year. The website characterized Leathers as a \"progressive activist\" from Indiana. Weiner released a written statement on Tuesday afternoon, which he read again\n\nquestion: What was Weiner's behavior described as?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "a terrible mistake that I unfortunately returned to during a rough time", "usage": 1130}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

While some things that have been posted today are true and some are not, there is no question that what I did was wrong. This behavior is behind me.\u201d Weiner did not elaborate on which of the new reports are true or false and whether or not it took place last summer. It's unclear how the lewd news will impact Weiner's campaign. Some New Yorkers have shown a willingness to forgive his past indiscretions since he announced his mayoral campaign via YouTube in May. He has since shot to the lead in the polls, with a Quinnipiac University survey last week showing he held 25 percent of the vote. Officials from Anthony Weiner\u2019s mayoral campaign did not respond to requests for additional comment from FoxNews.com.

Anthony Weiner of New York to resign following his admission of risqu\u00e9 online exchanges and lying about them. Pennsylvania Rep. Allyson Schwartz, a top Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee official, called Weiner's behavior \"offensive\" and said that he should resign. \"Having the respect of your constituents is fundamental for a member of Congress,\" she said in an interview with Politico. Schwartz joins a handful of other sitting Democrats, including Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Patrick Leahy of Vermont, and former DNC chairman Tim Kaine in calling for Weiner to step down. Top Republicans, including RNC chairman Reince Preibus and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, have also said Weiner should go. But some observers say the message to Weiner is hypocritical and politically motivated, given both public opinion polling showing that a majority of New Yorkers think Weiner should stay and the fact that Weiner has not been accused of breaking the law or convicted of violating any House rules. \"This is a massive overreaction and I don't understand it,\" said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Sloan pointed to the recent ethics case of another New York congressman, Charles Rangel, as an example of the double standard being pushed by some Democrats for Weiner. The House Ethics Committee found Rangel -- the former chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, which writes the nation's tax laws -- guilty of improper fundraising, inappropriate possession of multiple rent-controlled apartments and failure to pay taxes on a vacation home, among other charges. \"There were very few calls on Rangel to resign and he was censured of serious misconduct involving his office \u2013 really serious things that had potential for criminal charges,\" Sloan said. \"We don't have anything remotely like that in the Weiner case.\" Sloan explained that the mounting pressure on Weiner may stem in part from the early precedent set by House Speaker John Boehner when, at the first sign of sexual misconduct, he urged Reps. Mark Souder (R-Ind.) and Chris Lee (R-N.Y.) to resign, even though their behavior didn't appear to involve any abuse of their office. \"A lot of people really hate Weiner, too,\" she said, referring to Weiner's colleagues in the House, some of whom are said to have been rankled by his personality and frequent media appearances. As for Weiner's bald lies to his family, constituents and the general public in media appearances last week about the lewd photo that appeared on Twitter, Sloan said it was disconcerting and tarnished his credibility but not the worst Washington has seen. \"A politician lying is not that unusual,\" Sloan said. \"If the new standard is that politicians are out the second they lie to us, then a lot of politicians could be gone.\" The Senate Ethics Committee last month concluded that Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) tried to cover up a sex scandal with the wife of his former top aide, made false statements to the Federal Election Commission, and violated campaign finance laws. Ensign, who remained in office during the monthslong investigation, abruptly resigned before the findings were released.

'Special Report' All-Star panel weighs in Anthony Weiner shrugged off calls Wednesday to withdraw from the New York City mayoral race over a new sexting scandal, despite criticism from old colleagues, media calls for him to step down and newly released poll figures that gave him a moral character rating of 17 percent. Weiner told reporters Wednesday night that while the uproar of recent days had \"been rough,\" he felt \"these are things I brought upon myself.\" He added he was \"pressing forward.\" The ex-congressman was greeted with boos as he took the stage at a public housing meeting earlier Wednesday evening, the Associated Press reported.. But by the end of his remarks, the crowd loudly cheered. Even former Democratic congressional colleagues said enough is enough. Rep. Jerrold Nadler said Wednesday: \"I think he should pull out of the race. I think he needs serious psychiatric help.\" Rep. Joseph Crowley said New Yorkers are \"tired of the drama\" surrounding Weiner. And Rep. Charles Rangel said he believes the voters will put an end to Weiner's ambitions. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday afternoon that surveyed likely New York City Democratic voters from July 18-23 -- news of Weiner's latest indiscretions broke on the last day -- gave him a 17 percent score for moral character, 57 percent for experience and 51 percent for understanding. It also put him in first place, with 26 percent of the vote, in the first round of the Democratic primary but in the event of a runoff, the poll says he would finish behind former city comptroller William Thompson. The New York Post Wednesday reported Weiner had released an \"open letter\" in which he said sending the lewd texts and photos were \"a terrible mistake that I unfortunately returned to during a rough time\" in his marriage to wife Huma Abedin. Weiner Tuesday admitted sending a woman sexually explicit photos and messages and acknowledged the activity took place as recently as last summer, more than a year after he resigned from the House in June 2011 for the same sort of behavior with at least a half-dozen women. With Abedin standing an arm's length away from him, Weiner told a hastily called news conference he would stay in the race despite the new onslaught of negative publicity. \"I want to bring my vision to the people of the city of New York. I hope they are willing to still continue to give me a second chance,\" Weiner said. In an editorial posted online Tuesday, the New York Times urged Weiner to drop out of the race, saying Weiner \"should take his marital troubles and personal compulsions out of the public eye, away from cameras, off the Web and out of the race for mayor of New York City.\" Three of his rivals for mayor \u2014 Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and former City Councilman Sal Albanese, both Democrats, and billionaire John Catsimatidis, a Republican \u2014 also called on Weiner to quit the race. \"Enough is enough,\" de Blasio said. \"The sideshows of this election have gotten in the way of the debate we should be having about the future of this city.\" Another mayoral hopeful, city Comptroller John Liu, stopped short of calling for Weiner to bow out, but suggested his \"propensity for pornographic selfies is a valid issue for voters.\" The other leading Democratic candidates, including City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Thompson, did not immediately comment. The congressman fessed up to the naughty texts after sexually explicit photos and online chats between \"Carlos Danger,\" allegedly the pseudonym for the city hall hopeful, and an unidentified woman surfaced on the blog, TheDirty.com. The reports claim that that the conversation between the pol and an unidentified 23-year-old woman took place on the social media website Formspring in August 2012, a year after he resigned from his post in Congress after being caught the first time \u2014 and nearly seven months after his first child with wife Abedin was born. The woman claims on the blog that she first started talking online with Weiner in July 2012 and it became intense by August 2012, when he offered to find a Chicago condo where they could meet up. She also alleges that they had phone sex and that they exchanged nude photos of each other. She claims she received photos from Weiner of his penis sent from a Yahoo email account under the \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d name. The purported image was subsequently posted on TheDirty.com. Buzzfeed.com later reported that a source close to the matter said Weiner exchanged the explicit messages and photos with a woman named Sydney Elaine Leathers in late July of last year. The website characterized Leathers as a \"progressive activist\" from Indiana. Weiner released a written statement on Tuesday afternoon, which he read again\n\nquestion: What did Weiner acknowledge exchanging?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "sexually explicit photos and messages", "usage": 1122}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This behavior is behind me.\u201d Weiner did not elaborate on which of the new reports are true or false and whether or not it took place last summer. It's unclear how the lewd news will impact Weiner's campaign. Some New Yorkers have shown a willingness to forgive his past indiscretions since he announced his mayoral campaign via YouTube in May. He has since shot to the lead in the polls, with a Quinnipiac University survey last week showing he held 25 percent of the vote.

WASHINGTON \u2013 The second-ranking House Democrat on Sunday joined the party leadership in urging Rep. Anthony Weiner to quit because of his sexting scandal, a request the New York lawmaker has sidestepped in favor of a temporary leave of absence. The Republican Party chairman criticized Democratic leaders for not taking a more forceful stand earlier on the affair, which has overshadowed much of the legislative business on Capitol Hill over the past week. Weiner has acknowledged exchanging messages and photos, ranging from sexually suggestive to explicit, with several women online. The latest to surface appeared on the gossip website TMZ. The photos posted Sunday were purportedly taken in the House members' gym and show a shirtless Weiner with a towel around his waist and his hand on his crotch. In one photo he is naked and holding the towel over his crotch. TMZ said the photos were sent online to at least one woman. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, spoke of Weiner's \"bizarre and unacceptable behavior\" in sending inappropriate pictures of himself to young women. Hoyer said it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for Weiner to continue to represent his constituents effectively. In New York, foes and supporters of Weiner confronted each other. \"He's not fit to be our congressman,\" said Jim Scott, 61, one of about two dozen constituents who rallied in front of Weiner's office in the Kew Gardens section of Queens. \"People are sick of him, especially his attitude.\" Half a dozen Weiner supporters gathered a few yards away. College student Olivia Lurrie, 18, said Weiner was a good leader who made a mistake. Weiner announced Saturday that he was entering professional treatment at an undisclosed location and wanted a leave of absence from Congress. A statement from an aide did not say where he would receive treatment or what type was involved. That announcement came right after House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the national party head, said Weiner must go. Weiner said at news conference last Monday that he had lied in previously saying that he had not sent any photos. Pelosi immediately called for an ethics committee investigation. But it was not until the weekend that leaders said he should step down. Hoyer said the ethics committee process to decide if Weiner had committed an expellable offense would take time and \"I really don't know if we have that time.\" He said he didn't see how Weiner could stay in office. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Weiner should resign. \"We've got important work to do and this is a ridiculous distraction,\" he said in an appearance with Hoyer on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS. Lawmakers marching Sunday in New York's Puerto Rican Day parade were less demanding. \"I think it could have been handled better,\" Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said when asked whether he stood with Pelosi in calling for Weiner's resignation. Rangel, who was censured by the House last year for ethics violations, was also asked if he thought it was a good idea for Weiner to take time off to enter treatment. \"He is the one that knows the best, he and his wife,\" Rangel responded. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., declined to comment any further, saying, \"Those of us who have been longtime friends of Anthony are heartbroken, and I'm just going to try to enjoy the parade today.\" On NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus criticized Pelosi and other Democrats for not acting sooner. \"It seemed to me that for the first 10 days in this circus... the only job that Nancy Pelosi was interested in saving was Anthony Weiner's,\" he said. That drew a sharp retort from Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who accused Republicans of a double standard. She said that Republican leaders didn't call for the resignation of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., when he got caught up in a prostitution scandal, and that Priebus had not publicly sought the resignation of former Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., who stepped down this year over an affair with a staffer's wife. Wasserman Schultz said party officials initially gave Weiner \"some breathing room\" to reach the conclusion that he needed to step down on his own, but decided to toughen their stance Saturday after it became apparent he would not do so. David B. Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Akron, said Sunday: \"Had Anthony Weiner not been a rising star in the party and such a hero to progressives,\n\nquestion: What did Weiner initially resist calls to do?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Quit.", "usage": 1118}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Jerrold Nadler said Wednesday: \"I think he should pull out of the race. I think he needs serious psychiatric help.\" Rep. Joseph Crowley said New Yorkers are \"tired of the drama\" surrounding Weiner. And Rep. Charles Rangel said he believes the voters will put an end to Weiner's ambitions. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday afternoon that surveyed likely New York City Democratic voters from July 18-23 -- news of Weiner's latest indiscretions broke on the last day -- gave him a 17 percent score for moral character, 57 percent for experience and 51 percent for understanding. It also put him in first place, with 26 percent of the vote, in the first round of the Democratic primary but in the event of a runoff, the poll says he would finish behind former city comptroller William Thompson. The New York Post Wednesday reported Weiner had released an \"open letter\" in which he said sending the lewd texts and photos were \"a terrible mistake that I unfortunately returned to during a rough time\" in his marriage to wife Huma Abedin. Weiner Tuesday admitted sending a woman sexually explicit photos and messages and acknowledged the activity took place as recently as last summer, more than a year after he resigned from the House in June 2011 for the same sort of behavior with at least a half-dozen women. With Abedin standing an arm's length away from him, Weiner told a hastily called news conference he would stay in the race despite the new onslaught of negative publicity. \"I want to bring my vision to the people of the city of New York. I hope they are willing to still continue to give me a second chance,\" Weiner said. In an editorial posted online Tuesday, the New York Times urged Weiner to drop out of the race, saying Weiner \"should take his marital troubles and personal compulsions out of the public eye, away from cameras, off the Web and out of the race for mayor of New York City.\" Three of his rivals for mayor \u2014 Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and former City Councilman Sal Albanese, both Democrats, and billionaire John Catsimatidis, a Republican \u2014 also called on Weiner to quit the race. \"Enough is enough,\" de Blasio said. \"The sideshows of this election have gotten in the way of the debate we should be having about the future of this city.\" Another mayoral hopeful, city Comptroller John Liu, stopped short of calling for Weiner to bow out, but suggested his \"propensity for pornographic selfies is a valid issue for voters.\" The other leading Democratic candidates, including City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Thompson, did not immediately comment. The congressman fessed up to the naughty texts after sexually explicit photos and online chats between \"Carlos Danger,\" allegedly the pseudonym for the city hall hopeful, and an unidentified woman surfaced on the blog, TheDirty.com. The reports claim that that the conversation between the pol and an unidentified 23-year-old woman took place on the social media website Formspring in August 2012, a year after he resigned from his post in Congress after being caught the first time \u2014 and nearly seven months after his first child with wife Abedin was born. The woman claims on the blog that she first started talking online with Weiner in July 2012 and it became intense by August 2012, when he offered to find a Chicago condo where they could meet up. She also alleges that they had phone sex and that they exchanged nude photos of each other. She claims she received photos from Weiner of his penis sent from a Yahoo email account under the \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d name. The purported image was subsequently posted on TheDirty.com.

WASHINGTON \u2013 The second-ranking House Democrat on Sunday joined the party leadership in urging Rep. Anthony Weiner to quit because of his sexting scandal, a request the New York lawmaker has sidestepped in favor of a temporary leave of absence. The Republican Party chairman criticized Democratic leaders for not taking a more forceful stand earlier on the affair, which has overshadowed much of the legislative business on Capitol Hill over the past week. Weiner has acknowledged exchanging messages and photos, ranging from sexually suggestive to explicit, with several women online. The latest to surface appeared on the gossip website TMZ. The photos posted Sunday were purportedly taken in the House members' gym and show a shirtless Weiner with a towel around his waist and his hand on his crotch. In one photo he is naked and holding the towel over his crotch. TMZ said the photos were sent online to at least one woman. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, spoke of Weiner's \"bizarre and unacceptable behavior\" in sending inappropriate pictures of himself to young women. Hoyer said it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for Weiner to continue to represent his constituents effectively. In New York, foes and supporters of Weiner confronted each other. \"He's not fit to be our congressman,\" said Jim Scott, 61, one of about two dozen constituents who rallied in front of Weiner's office in the Kew Gardens section of Queens. \"People are sick of him, especially his attitude.\" Half a dozen Weiner supporters gathered a few yards away. College student Olivia Lurrie, 18, said Weiner was a good leader who made a mistake. Weiner announced Saturday that he was entering professional treatment at an undisclosed location and wanted a leave of absence from Congress. A statement from an aide did not say where he would receive treatment or what type was involved. That announcement came right after House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the national party head, said Weiner must go. Weiner said at news conference last Monday that he had lied in previously saying that he had not sent any photos. Pelosi immediately called for an ethics committee investigation. But it was not until the weekend that leaders said he should step down. Hoyer said the ethics committee process to decide if Weiner had committed an expellable offense would take time and \"I really don't know if we have that time.\" He said he didn't see how Weiner could stay in office. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Weiner should resign. \"We've got important work to do and this is a ridiculous distraction,\" he said in an appearance with Hoyer on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS. Lawmakers marching Sunday in New York's Puerto Rican Day parade were less demanding. \"I think it could have been handled better,\" Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said when asked whether he stood with Pelosi in calling for Weiner's resignation. Rangel, who was censured by the House last year for ethics violations, was also asked if he thought it was a good idea for Weiner to take time off to enter treatment. \"He is the one that knows the best, he and his wife,\" Rangel responded. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., declined to comment any further, saying, \"Those of us who have been longtime friends of Anthony are heartbroken, and I'm just going to try to enjoy the parade today.\" On NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus criticized Pelosi and other Democrats for not acting sooner. \"It seemed to me that for the first 10 days in this circus... the only job that Nancy Pelosi was interested in saving was Anthony Weiner's,\" he said. That drew a sharp retort from Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who accused Republicans of a double standard. She said that Republican leaders didn't call for the resignation of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., when he got caught up in a prostitution scandal, and that Priebus had not publicly sought the resignation of former Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., who stepped down this year over an affair with a staffer's wife. Wasserman Schultz said party officials initially gave Weiner \"some breathing room\" to reach the conclusion that he needed to step down on his own, but decided to toughen their stance Saturday after it became apparent he would not do so. David B. Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Akron, said Sunday: \"Had Anthony Weiner not been a rising star in the party and such a hero to progressives,\n\nquestion: What did the incident highlight?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The incident highlighted a sexting scandal involving Rep.

In light of Anthony Weiner\u2019s offensive behavior... he should resign,\u201d Schwartz said. But Howard Witz, a real estate broker in Brooklyn, part of Weiner\u2019s district in New York City, said he would support Weiner again should he stay in politics. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame because he\u2019s a very effective politician,\u201d Witz said. \u201cDisappointed? Maybe. But does it make me quit on him? No it doesn\u2019t. As long as he didn\u2019t commit a crime.\u201d Another New Yorker, Joe Mele, was blunter in talking about Weiner, who has voiced ambitions to run for mayor of New York in 2013. \u201cMayor? I don\u2019t think he should be dogcatcher,\u201d Mele said. Weiner, married to a longtime aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, acknowledged on Monday he had inappropriate Internet and telephone conversations with six women. But the 46-year-old lawmaker said he had broken no law and would not resign.  Dan Ripp of Bradley Woods, a private firm that tracks Washington for investors, said he expected Weiner to quit within days. \u201cI think he\u2019s history,\u201d Ripp said. \u201cDemocrats aren\u2019t giving him the time of day. He has no clout. His own party is looking at him like a bozo. He is dragging them down.\u201d A little more than half of New York City voters think Weiner should remain in office, according to a NY1-Marist poll taken just hours after his tearful admission. But a majority, 56 percent, say he should give up his hopes of becoming the next New York mayor. Actor Alec Baldwin, long thought to be considering a political career, may jump into the race. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule it out,\u201d his publicist Matthew Hiltzik said, responding to a report in The Daily online publication, which reported that the star of television\u2019s \u201c30 Rock\u201d believed the Weiner scandal had improved his chances to become mayor. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has asked the House Ethics Committee to investigate whether Weiner violated any of the chamber\u2019s rules. House Republican Leader Eric Cantor on Tuesday became the first top U.S. lawmaker to say Weiner should step down, saying Congress was too busy with other matters to deal with Weiner\u2019s tweets. Former Democratic Party Chairman Tim Kaine, now running for the Senate from Virginia, also called on Weiner to step down. \u201cLying is unforgivable, public lying about something like this is unforgivable. He should resign,\u201d Kaine told a television station on Tuesday in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Obama's comments were his first remarks on the lurid scandal, in which Weiner first denied and later admitted exchanging lewd photographs and online messages with several women he had met through social media. \"I think he's embarrassed himself. He's acknowledged that. He's embarrassed his wife and his family. Ultimately, there's gonna be a decision for him and his constituents. I can tell you that, if it was me, I would resign,\" Obama said in the interview. \"When you get to the point where, because of various personal distractions, you can't serve as effectively as you need to at the time when people are worrying about jobs, and their mortgages, and paying the bills, then you should probably step back.\" On Monday the House of Representatives unanimously granted Weiner's request for a two week leave of absence. Before Obama's comments, other senior Democrats had called on Weiner to quit over the weekend, including the Democratic leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, and the influential chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Steve Israel, who called Weiner's scandal \"an insurmountable distraction\". So far Weiner has maintained that he will stay in office, and there is little the Democratic heirarchy can do to force him out, other than strip him of his spot of the House's powerful energy and commerce committee. Republicans in Congress have been pressing the Democratic leadership to expel Weiner, but Pelosi said in a statement: \"None of us, not anybody here, has the power to force somebody out of office. That person has to decide himself as to whether he will stay or he will go.\" Weiner has said that he would not resign without talking to his wife, Huma Abedin, herself an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Abedin is expected to return from a trip overseas on Tuesday.\n\nquestion: What did the incident highlight?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Obama's remarks highlight the pressure for Anthony Weiner to resign amid the scandal.", "usage": 565}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Anthony Weiner of New York to resign following his admission of risqu\u00e9 online exchanges and lying about them. Pennsylvania Rep. Allyson Schwartz, a top Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee official, called Weiner's behavior \"offensive\" and said that he should resign. \"Having the respect of your constituents is fundamental for a member of Congress,\" she said in an interview with Politico. Schwartz joins a handful of other sitting Democrats, including Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Patrick Leahy of Vermont, and former DNC chairman Tim Kaine in calling for Weiner to step down. Top Republicans, including RNC chairman Reince Preibus and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, have also said Weiner should go. But some observers say the message to Weiner is hypocritical and politically motivated, given both public opinion polling showing that a majority of New Yorkers think Weiner should stay and the fact that Weiner has not been accused of breaking the law or convicted of violating any House rules. \"This is a massive overreaction and I don't understand it,\" said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Sloan pointed to the recent ethics case of another New York congressman, Charles Rangel, as an example of the double standard being pushed by some Democrats for Weiner. The House Ethics Committee found Rangel -- the former chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, which writes the nation's tax laws -- guilty of improper fundraising, inappropriate possession of multiple rent-controlled apartments and failure to pay taxes on a vacation home, among other charges. \"There were very few calls on Rangel to resign and he was censured of serious misconduct involving his office \u2013 really serious things that had potential for criminal charges,\" Sloan said. \"We don't have anything remotely like that in the Weiner case.\" Sloan explained that the mounting pressure on Weiner may stem in part from the early precedent set by House Speaker John Boehner when, at the first sign of sexual misconduct, he urged Reps. Mark Souder (R-Ind.) and Chris Lee (R-N.Y.) to resign, even though their behavior didn't appear to involve any abuse of their office. \"A lot of people really hate Weiner, too,\" she said, referring to Weiner's colleagues in the House, some of whom are said to have been rankled by his personality and frequent media appearances. As for Weiner's bald lies to his family, constituents and the general public in media appearances last week about the lewd photo that appeared on Twitter, Sloan said it was disconcerting and tarnished his credibility but not the worst Washington has seen. \"A politician lying is not that unusual,\" Sloan said. \"If the new standard is that politicians are out the second they lie to us, then a lot of politicians could be gone.\" The Senate Ethics Committee last month concluded that Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) tried to cover up a sex scandal with the wife of his former top aide, made false statements to the Federal Election Commission, and violated campaign finance laws. Ensign, who remained in office during the monthslong investigation, abruptly resigned before the findings were released. The committee later referred the case to both the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\nquestion: What did the incident highlight?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The incident highlighted a double standard and hypocritical, politically motivated pressure on Anthony Weiner to resign.", "usage": 797}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.
