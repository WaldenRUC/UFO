It was a beautiful day under a sparkling blue sky, and as he sped down Maryland\u2019s Route 32 with the window down and radio blasting, the teenager was sure it was going to be a lucky day. Soon after 8.46am the radio cut to news that a plane had crashed into one of the Twin Towers in New York City. At 9.03am, by now at his desk, he was stunned to hear that a second plane had crashed into the other tower, followed half an hour later by similar catastrophe at the Pentagon in Washington. He leapt back into his car and screeched into reverse, only to find himself stuck in gridlocked traffic sandwiched between hundreds of other vehicles. He was stuck outside the headquarters of the National Security Agency (NSA), the US intelligence body that runs one of the largest surveillance operations in the world. The road was jammed with personnel streaming out of the NSA building following an order to evacuate. The air was thick with the sound of yelling, cellphones ringing, car engines revving vainly in the stationary traffic. The surreal spectacle of thousands of NSA intelligence agents abandoning their posts after the worst terrorist attack on the US, only to be bogged down in gridlock, made a deep impression on the teenager, Edward Snowden. As did 9/11 itself, which radically changed the course of his life. In its wake, Snowden became caught up in the surge of patriotism that swept the nation. Inspired to play his part, he joined the army, entered the intelligence community, and some 12 years after 9/11 found himself back at the same NSA where he had ground to a halt on that fateful day. The attacks on the Twin Towers and Pentagon had brought Snowden deep into the heart of America\u2019s secretive surveillance operations. But in the process it had given him access to highly classified databases that revealed to him a massive secret world, a sort of hidden state-within-the-state that had been created in the wake of 9/11. Snowden would go on to carry out the largest intelligence leak in the NSA\u2019s history. It would expose one of the great legacies of 9/11 \u2013 the rise of the ubiquitous US surveillance state. \u201cPanic made us politically vulnerable,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian as he ruminated on the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11. \u201cThat vulnerability was exploited by our own government to entitle itself to radically expanded powers that had for decades been out of reach.\u201d Snowden said that upon reflection the explosion of domestic spying post-9/11 should have been anticipated. \u201cWe should have known what was to come and, looking back at the public record, I think that on an intellectual level many of us did know. But political and media elites relentlessly repeated that the choice here was obvious: a guarantee of life or a certainty of death.\u201d That teenager on 9/11 is now an exile from his own country, charged under the Espionage Act for having revealed the US government\u2019s mass espionage on its own people. The way he sees it 20 years on, the false claim that expanding state power was necessary to avoid certain death from further terrorist atrocities has led to decades of public indifference. \u201cWith that framing, who could care whether or not the gloves came off the machinery of state? We are only now beginning to care again \u2013 to care collectively \u2013 because we sit at the bottom of a 20-year hole carved by our neglect.\u201d It happened in the blink of an eye. Within hours of the fourth plane crashing into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, George Bush\u2019s White House and intelligence chiefs had begun to lay the foundations of the mass surveillance state. The Patriot Act, which swatted away longstanding rules preventing the state from monitoring US citizens without \u201cprobable cause\u201d, was passed in a lightning-fast 45 days. The legislation became law with minimal debate or opposition in Congress, granting domestic law enforcement agencies sweeping new powers. It allowed the government to track the online behavior of Americans while making it much easier to acquire a warrant. It gave the green light for the FBI and CIA to carry out \u201croving wiretaps\u201d where agents could follow communications trails between phones and computers. It eviscerated the firewall that had been in place since the 1970s shielding US citizens from foreign surveillance. And it greatly boosted the power of the FBI to obtain personal customer records of Americans from phone companies, banks and internet providers without court approval through so-called National Security Letters. If the Patriot Act was produced in a flash, behind the scenes secret systems for mass surveillance were being built at even greater speed. One of the most audacious plans was drafted by nightfall on the day of 11 September itself\n\nquestion: What did former President Bush authorize the NSA to do?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Patriot Act granted domestic law enforcement agencies sweeping new powers, including the government to track the online behavior of Americans, acquire warrants, carry out \"roving wiretaps\" and obtain personal customer records of Americans from phone companies, banks, and internet providers without court approval through national security letters.", "usage": 1166}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Controversial NSA Surveillance Operations: Global Concerns and Political Vulnerability\n\nevidence: . The plan, ominously titled \u201cTotal information awareness\u201d, was the brainchild of John Poindexter, a disgraced former naval officer who had been Ronald Reagan\u2019s national security adviser and a key figure in the Iran-contra scandal. TIA, Poindexter blustered, would act as an early-warning alarm for future 9/11s by gathering up the digital data of all Americans \u2013 innocent or guilty \u2013 and using it to search for patterns of terrorist activity. No warrants would be sought. They would just do it, irrespective of laws or constitutional niceties. \u201cWe must put introduction of new technology on a wartime basis,\u201d Poindexter said. Weeks later he managed to sell the idea to the Pentagon in return for a $200m budget. The NSA wasn\u2019t far behind. The agency was busy devising Stellar Wind, its warrantless surveillance system. It sought to identify terrorist links by analysing the metadata drawn from the emails, telephone calls and internet activity of huge numbers of Americans. The Snowden documents showed that by 14 September \u2013 just three days after the attacks \u2013 the then director of the NSA, Michael Hayden, had taken a \u201ctactical decision\u201d to begin snooping on the digital communications of people based in the US. From now on, the NSA granted itself the power to surveil any American on US soil who was in digital contact with a foreign country where terrorism was known to exist \u2013 no warrant needed. This was a seismic shift. It meant that the nation\u2019s most powerful eavesdropping agency had ascribed to itself, without consulting Congress or the courts, the ability to listen in to the communications of Americans in a way that violated constitutional rights and laws. On 4 October 2001 the White House granted permission, again in secret and without consultation, for the NSA to turn its spotlight on to US citizens in what became known as the President\u2019s Surveillance Program. \u201cThey essentially claimed wartime authority to engage in domestic surveillance that is criminal under statutory law,\u201d said Ben Wizner, Snowden\u2019s lawyer, who works on surveillance at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). How could the spymasters have moved to put in place complex systems of mass surveillance just hours and days after 9/11? There is only one answer, many observers believe. \u201cThey had it all ready,\u201d said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which defends civil liberties in the digital space. \u201cThis is what the NSA had long wanted \u2013 to \u2018sit on the wire\u2019, to watch all internet traffic and pick out whatever they chose. Now they finally had the crisis they needed to make it happen.\u201d By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, an entire nation within the nation had arisen dedicated to keeping the American people nominally safe by placing everybody under observation. The Washington Post called it a \u201cTop Secret America hidden from public view\u201d. The sprawling surveillance infrastructure had proliferated to the extent that nobody \u2013 not even top intelligence officials \u2013 knew how much it cost or how many it employed. The Post\u2019s best estimate in July 2010 was that it spanned 10,000 locations across the US. The scale of growth can be glimpsed by looking at some of the public elements. The number of National Security Letters granted each year increased more than fourfold between 2000 and 2003, peaking at almost 60,000 the following year. By 2008 almost 20,000 people were being targeted under its remit. The intelligence budget grew from a little over $40bn a year in the late 1990s to almost $100bn by 2010, remaining $80bn to this day. When Wizner looks back on the past 20 years he is struck not just by this explosion in surveillance but also by the failure of governance that enabled it. Key institutions like the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court, which is supposed to provide legal oversight, genuflected in front of the NSA. \u201cThis is a story about checks and balances failing,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cThe courts deferred to the expertise and secrecy claims of the executive, Congress failed to hold the intelligence agencies accountable.\u201d Even the media fell short of holding power to account. When in 2005 the New York Times revealed the NSA\u2019s warrantless wiretapping, the newspaper admitted that it had sat on the story for a year at the behest of the White House. The LA Times spiked a story brought to it by a whistleblower who revealed that the telecom company AT&T had handed over all its internet traffic to the NSA. The paper had been lobbied by Hayden and the then director of national intelligence, John Negroponte. Traditional oversight did have some successes. Ron Wyden, a US senator for Oregon, managed to have Poindexter\u2019s Total Information Awareness program shut down in 2003, after an intern in his office stumbled across documents describing the operation. \u201cThat was one of our first wins \u2013\n\nquestion: What did former President Bush authorize the NSA to do?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1103}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Controversial NSA Surveillance Operations: Global Concerns and Political Vulnerability\n\nevidence:  it would have been the biggest spying operation in history,\u201d Wyden said. (Three years later it was revealed that elements of the program had secretly been transferred from the Pentagon to the NSA.) Wyden, a longstanding member of the Senate select committee on intelligence, has been at the forefront of efforts to force sunlight into the world of secret surveillance. As the 10th anniversary of 9/11 was approaching he issued his famous warning on the Senate floor, telling the American people that when they found out how the government had interpreted the Patriot Act \u201cthey will be stunned and they will be angry\u201d. In another legendary moment two years later, he posed a direct question to the then director of national intelligence, James Clapper, about whether the NSA was collecting data on hundreds of millions of Americans. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d Clapper lied. Wyden told the Guardian that the exchange showed how far the government had allowed itself to slide in terms of basic American values. \u201cJames Clapper lied to the American people and he lied to the committee. It wasn\u2019t the only time they lied \u2013 they lied several times over the years, which is why I finally said I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I didn\u2019t ask the question I did in public.\u201d It is a paradox of Wyden\u2019s attempts to wrench surveillance into the open that despite his efforts the full truth about the massive dragnet of all Americans\u2019 digital communications remained concealed. As a member of the committee, the senator was briefed in secret about the warrantless eavesdropping but was constrained by what he has called the \u201ccumbersome and unwieldy\u201d restrictions on his public remarks. The Guardian asked Wyden whether he thought, with the benefit of hindsight over these past 20 years, that Congress could have done more to check the intelligence agencies. \u201cYou look back, and the answer is: sure. You keep pushing the rock up the hill and you have wins, and there are times when you wish there had been stronger support for reform.\u201d Before Edward Snowden there was Mark Klein. He was the whistleblower who exposed the AT&T story that the LA Times declined to publish. Klein was a technician assigned to the internet room of AT&T\u2019s Folsom Street building in San Francisco through which colossal quantities of data passed every hour. It was 2004 and unbeknown to the public the telecoms company had been bending over backwards since days after 9/11 to help the US government spy on its own people. As Klein went about routine maintenance, his eye was drawn to a splitter cabinet inside the room. It was dividing the light beam carrying the data into two separate signals, and passing one of them \u2013 an exact copy of the other \u2013 down to the floor below. Klein\u2019s curiosity intensified when he tried to follow the signal and found that the lower room was locked behind a door marked 641A. Nobody was allowed in without special authorization from the NSA. When Klein obtained internal engineering documents outlining the flow of data through the splitter cabinet down to the secret room, his suspicions were confirmed. The NSA was copying and collecting everybody\u2019s information carried not only by AT&T but also by 16 other internet providers who shared the pipeline. \u201cI was horrified and astonished. It was like a police state, sweeping up everybody\u2019s information blindly and allowing agents to go through it at their leisure.\u201d Klein\u2019s discovery was made public by Wired magazine in 2006. The documents he obtained went on to form the basis of a major lawsuit launched by the EFF, though in 2008 Congress passed a law absolving AT&T and other phone companies from any legal liability for collaborating with the spy chiefs. Mark Klein, Thomas Tamm, Thomas Drake, William Binney, Kirk Wiebe, Edward Loomis, Diane Roark \u2013 the list of individuals who, for a variety of motives, provided critical information to investigative journalists seeking to expose the surveillance state is long and impressive. Without them, given the failure of checks and balances, we might still be in the dark today. \u201cEverything we know about mass surveillance we know not because of our government institutions but despite them,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cWe know because of courageous sources and journalists who pried those stories out into the light.\u201d And then there was Snowden. On 6 June 2013 \u2013 almost 12 years after 9/11 \u2013 the first incendiary story exposing the NSA\u2019s dragnet of the telephone records of millions of Verizon customers was published by the Guardian. The next day the paper reported on Prism, a system for sucking up data from US internet giants including Google and Facebook. The lid on the secret US surveillance state had finally been lifted. One of the documents Snowden disclosed neatly encapsulated the NSA\u2019s posture: \u201cSniff It All, Know It All, Collect It All, Process It All, Exploit It All, Partner It All.\u201d Snowden has an even more\n\nquestion: What did former President Bush authorize the NSA to do?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1083}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In his memoir Permanent Record he writes: \u201cAll of us had been reduced to something like children, who\u2019d be forced to live the rest of our lives under omniscient parental supervision.\u201d It is tempting to think of the mass surveillance put in place post-9/11 as a great leveler \u2013 after all, the NSA did grab the metadata of all Americans irrespective of race, class or religion. But to suggest that 9/11 gave birth to a new equality of snooping under the government\u2019s all-seeing eye would be a travesty. Surveillance has always fallen unevenly in the US, stretching back to the days when slaves were required to carry lanterns at night so they could be followed. After 9/11 it was the turn of Muslims. \u201cThe Patriot Act was the stepping stone for what became open season on American Muslims,\u201d said Nihad Awad, the executive director of the advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cThere were no rules. The government just said \u2018Let\u2019s go after Muslims.\u2019\u201d Before 9/11 Awad had been invited to sit on White House advisory committees. After 9/11 he and his family would routinely be stopped and searched at airports and treated like criminals. \u201cWe became the enemy,\u201d he said. For years Awad was puzzled by the hostile stories in the press containing personal details, the banks that refused to do business with him. He had to wait until Snowden to make sense of what was happening. An investigation by the Intercept based on the Snowden files showed that Awad had been placed on a top-secret list of 7,485 people, many foreigners but also including an unknown number of Americans, whose emails were being monitored by the NSA and FBI. They included other high-profile Muslim Americans including a former Republican candidate, a lawyer and university professors. \u201cWhen Snowden let us know that I was on the list I realized the government had access to my private emails and were sharing them with Congress and leaking them to the media,\u201d Awad said. \u201cI felt invaded by my own government, punished for leading a civil rights organization. If people like me in positions of influence were treated like this, what about the average Muslim?\u201d Asad Dandia was born and raised in Brooklyn. He was eight years-old on 9/11 and a teenager when his troubles started. As a religiously observant Muslim, he had founded with friends a food distribution charity offering help to struggling families from his community. In March 2012 he was contacted through Facebook by a stranger named Shamiur Rahman who said he wanted to volunteer for a spiritually grounded organization like his. Rahman said he had been through a rough patch himself and now wanted to help others. Dandia welcomed Rahman in. \u201cHe quickly grew close to me and to my circles,\u201d he said. \u201cHe met my family, he ate my mother\u2019s food, he slept over one night. We shared many intimate moments of emotional and spiritual reflection.\u201d At times Rahman behaved strangely. Whenever Dandia introduced him to anybody the first thing he would do would be to ask for their phone number. He also asked provocative questions, like what Dandia thought of the killing in Benghazi of Christopher Stevens, the US ambassador to Libya. \u201cThat was a really dumb question \u2013 it was murder and obviously we thought it was wrong,\u201d Dandia said. But he gave Rahman the benefit of the doubt. \u201cI attributed that to the fact he had mental health and drug addiction issues. I thought we should be patient with him.\u201d A few months after Rahman entered his life, Dandia was taken aside by a member of his local Muslim community who was working as an NYPD officer. \u201cYou are being watched, there\u2019s a file with your name and photos in it and you are being followed,\u201d he told Dandia. Seven months into their friendship, Rahman posted a confession on Facebook. He was an NYPD informant tasked with infiltrating Muslim groups and mosques. The news travelled fast and sent a chill throughout the area. Mosques asked Dandia to stop fundraising for his food bank as they were afraid of being targeted themselves. Dandia grew reclusive. \u201cIt made me suspicious of people. I hid my left-leaning political views and deeper religious commitments. That wasn\u2019t how I wanted to live, in a state of permanent paranoia, but there was a complete breakdown in trust.\u201d Through the Associated Press, Dandia came to learn that he was just a speck in the NYPD\u2019s mountainous surveillance of Muslims. Communities up and down the east coast were mapped through a secret \u201cDemographics Unit\u201d and individuals\u2019 daily habits \u2013 shopping, work, prayer, school \u2013 tracked on massive CIA-\n\nquestion: What did former President Bush authorize the NSA to do?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "authorize the NSA to grab the metadata of all Americans regardless of race, class, or religion.", "usage": 1083}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Muslims with drug habits who fell into the NYPD\u2019s clutches, like Rahman, were offered lenient treatment in return for turning informant. \u201cI felt betrayed,\u201d Dandia said. \u201cI was born and raised in New York. This is the city that I love and that I\u2019m proud to call my home. It targeted me because of my religion, like a foreign enemy.\u201d Since Snowden shone his laser beam into the secret surveillance state-within-a-state, there has been a concerted effort to restore the balance, destroyed after 9/11, between individual liberties and national security. The USA Freedom Act in 2015 curtailed some of the NSA\u2019s metadata practices, passing the storage of bulk phone records from the agency to the phone companies, and opening up the foreign intelligence surveillance court to a modicum of public scrutiny. It was the first time since the 1970s that Congress had limited the NSA\u2019s authority in any way. \u201cWe have closed great swathes of the internet to the oldest methods of mass surveillance,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian. In 2019 the NSA let it be known that it had shut down its mass collection of phone and text records. The NSA cited \u201ctechnical irregularities\u201d, but by then it was widely known that the spying program had not only been illegal in its inception, it just hadn\u2019t worked. Despite the NSA\u2019s claim that by snooping on all Americans\u2019 communications it had thwarted numerous other 9/11s, the agency could only point to one terrorism case, that of Basaalay Moalin, found guilty of funding Somali extremism, that had come through the phone records program. Last year a federal judge concluded that even Moalin\u2019s case had been irrelevant: the NSA played no role in his conviction. There have been other victories in the battle against the surveillance state. Wyden was heartened by the vote in the Senate last year on his amendment to protect the browsing history of Americans from secret surveillance. The amendment failed, but by only one vote. \u201cI thought that was very telling, we almost won \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t have happened 15 years ago.\u201d Asad Dandia signed up to a class-action lawsuit challenging the NYPD\u2019s mass surveillance of him and so many other Muslim Americans. In 2016 they achieved a groundbreaking settlement that sharply reined in police targeting of religious and racial groups. \u201cI felt empowered, it gave me hope that Americans can push the country to live up to its own ideals,\u201d he said. Perhaps the biggest shift has been among the American people. The urge of individuals to protect themselves against state eavesdropping became so intense that tech giants were forced to respond and in 2016, for the first time since the internet was created, it carried more encrypted data than unencrypted. Which is not to say that the state-within-a-state has withered away, or that the balance between privacy and security has been perfected. \u201cNot even close,\u201d Cohn said. The Guardian asked surveillance experts what, in the present moment, keeps them up at night. What dastardly new tricks from the spymasters do they fear most? Wyden pointed to legal loopholes that allow shady private data brokers to sell Americans\u2019 personal information to government agencies without any court oversight. \u201cI continue to be very worried about that,\u201d he said. Snowden raised a similar shift, where mass surveillance is now predominantly performed by \u201camoral telecommunications and surveillance-masquerading-as-advertising companies. They exploit weaknesses in our laws, devices and networks to pad out their dossiers, and then sell them to governments.\u201d Cohn talked about how surveillance cameras were being weaponized with the addition of facial recognition technology that could have especially dire consequences for people of colour. Wizner said he sweated over the rise of robotic surveillance and AI. \u201cMore and more we will see critical decisions affecting liberty being made inside black boxes,\u201d he said. For Patrick Toomey of the ACLU\u2019s national security project, what keeps him up at night is simply all of it, the whole technological gamut. \u201cThe threat is persistent surveillance \u2013 of being surveilled wherever we go using a vast network of devices that can potentially listen to what we say, or recognize who we are based on our faces or the way we walk. There\u2019s a very real danger that this sensitive information will be used to make decisions that are discriminatory or inaccurate, that can profoundly impact our lives.\u201d In the last analysis, the US surveillance state got away with operating in total secret for so many years after 9/11 that it raises the question: are we still in the dark? \u201cThis will always be like trying to keep the kibble from the cat,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cSo long as they know what they want is out there somewhere, they\u2019re going\n\nquestion: What did former President Bush authorize the NSA to do?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1070}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The framers of the Constitution recognized the threat a standing army posed to democracy and they sought to establish a government that guaranteed civilian supremacy over the military. This ideal was finally codified after the Civil War through the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibited the Army from engaging in law enforcement activities on U.S. soil. But Congress has weakened Posse Comitatus over the years by permitting military involvement in drug enforcement, border control and all sorts of other \u201cdomestic support\u201d operations. As a result, the military is increasingly turning its powerful intelligence collection capabilities against Americans. Total Information Awareness. Shortly after 9/11, the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began a project called \u201cTotal Information Awareness\u201d to collect and mine vast amounts of information about the American public, including their telephone records, bank records, medical records, and educational and travel data, in an attempt to identify terrorists. Congress de-funded TIA in 2003 in the wake of the public outcry denouncing such an Orwellian spying operation, but large scale information collection and data mining programs persist, and the military remains heavily involved. NSA\u2019s Warrantless Wiretapping Program. In December 2005 the New York Times revealed that soon after the September 11 attacks, former President Bush authorized the National Security Agency (NSA), an intelligence component of the Defense Department, to conduct warrantless surveillance of American\u2019s e-mails and telephone calls in blatant violation of a federal statute which prohibited the practice (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act). Subsequent articles in USA Today revealed that major telecommunications companies \u201cworking under contract to the NSA\u201d also provided the government with millions of Americans\u2019 domestic call data for \u201csocial network analysis.\u201d This warrantless surveillance program operated until January 2007. FISA Amendments Act Electronic Surveillance. In 2008 Congress passed a law called the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) which not only legalized the NSA\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program, it actually expanded the NSA\u2019s power to conduct warrantless, suspicion-less dragnet collection of American\u2019s international e-mails and telephone calls. Although very little is known about the government\u2019s implementation of its intrusive FAA spying powers, two New York Times articles (April and July 2009; LINK) revealed the NSA was collecting Americans\u2019 communications under the FAA by the millions and that it was improperly collecting purely domestic communications. National Security Letters. In 2007 an ACLU lawsuit revealed that DoD secretly issued hundreds of national security letters (NSLs) to obtain private and sensitive records of people within the United States without court approval. While the FBI has broad NSL powers and compliance with FBI-issued NSLs is mandatory, DoD\u2019s NSL power is more limited in scope, and, in most cases, compliance with DoD demands is not mandatory. A comprehensive analysis of 455 NSLs issued after 9/11 shows that the DoD seems to have collaborated with the FBI to circumvent the law to use FBI NSLs to obtain records DoD was not authorized to demand for its own investigations. TALON and The Counterintelligence Field Activity Agency (CIFA). But military spying goes far beyond the NSA and abuse of NSLs. In 2003 a highly secretive component of the DoD, the Counterintelligence Field Activity Agency (\u201cCIFA\u201d), began a program to track potential terrorist threats to Department personnel or property within the United States through Threat and Local Observation Notices (\u201cTALON\u201d). These TALON reports were designed to permit civilians and military personnel to report on suspicious activity near defense installations. Not surprisingly, the DOD soon strayed from this limited mission and TALON became a repository for information about peaceful anti-war protesters, and even Quakers. Reports were added to the database even when the \u201cthreat\u201d was an anti-war protest that occurred far from any military installation. Other \u201cthreats\u201d the military deemed non-credible were never removed from the database. CIFA was disbanded in 2008, but a new office at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) was opened to assume CIFA\u2019s \u201cresources and responsibilities.\u201d In May 2010 DoD announced it was going to participate in a new suspicious activity reporting program through the FBI\u2019s eGuardian program. Then, in June 2010 DIA published a federal register notice announcing the creation of a new data base for information on \u201cindividuals involved in, or of interest to, DoD intelligence, counterintelligence, counterterrorism and counter-narcotic operations or analytical projects as well as individuals involved in foreign intelligence and/or training activities\u201d \u2013 in short, what appears to be a de facto resurrection of the CIFA program. Political Protest Groups. DoD personnel have also been involved in illegal undercover operations targeting political protest groups.

He used a fake name and posed as a sympathizer for more than a year, all the while reporting the groups\u2019 activities to the local law enforcement agencies he worked with. While the military opened an internal investigation, a leaked 2009 Department of the Army document (\u201cConcept of Operations for Police Intelligence Operations\u201d) claims that Military Police Intelligence units are not subject to legal limitations on domestic military intelligence operations. Fusion Centers and JTTFs. The U.S. military is also involved in intelligence activities conducted through FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) and state and local intelligence fusion centers. For example, DoD is involved in a nationwide FBI investigation that targets returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans to determine if they have become right-wing extremists. DoD\u2019s role in this investigation is likely being coordinated through JTTFs. And though DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano reportedly told the New York Times \u201cthat fusion centers were not intended to have a military presence, and that she was not aware of ones that did,\u201d National Guard troops are present in many fusion centers; indeed, the ACLU documented U.S. Army presence at a Maryland fusion center in 2007. Moreover, in 2009 DHS announced it was giving state and local fusion centers access to classified military intelligence in DoD databases. An ongoing scandal involving military personnel and the Los Angeles County Terrorism Early Warning Center (LACTEW), one of the country\u2019s first fusion centers, highlights the lack of oversight in these joint intelligence operations. According to reports from the San Diego Union-Tribune, a group of military reservists and law enforcement officers led by the co-founder of the L.A. fusion center engaged in a years-long conspiracy to steal highly classified intelligence files from the Strategic Technical Operations Center located at the U.S. Marine Corps Base at Camp Pendleton, California and secret surveillance reports from the U.S. Northern Command headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Some of the stolen files reportedly \u201cpertained to surveillance of Muslim communities in Southern California,\u201d including mosques in Los Angeles and San Diego, and revealed \u201ca federal surveillance program targeting Muslim groups\u201d in the United States. The scheme apparently began in 2001 when the LACTEW fusion center\u2019s co-founder called a civilian analyst at U.S. Northern Command to ask that she surreptitiously supply the LACTEW with military surveillance reports. The reported involvement of the National Security Agency in the investigation hints that these records may relate to warrantless domestic surveillance operations conducted by the military. \u00ab Back to Suspicious Activity Reporting Programs | Go To Spy Files \u00bb Every month, you'll receive regular roundups of the most important civil rights and civil liberties developments.

It was a beautiful day under a sparkling blue sky, and as he sped down Maryland\u2019s Route 32 with the window down and radio blasting, the teenager was sure it was going to be a lucky day. Soon after 8.46am the radio cut to news that a plane had crashed into one of the Twin Towers in New York City. At 9.03am, by now at his desk, he was stunned to hear that a second plane had crashed into the other tower, followed half an hour later by similar catastrophe at the Pentagon in Washington. He leapt back into his car and screeched into reverse, only to find himself stuck in gridlocked traffic sandwiched between hundreds of other vehicles. He was stuck outside the headquarters of the National Security Agency (NSA), the US intelligence body that runs one of the largest surveillance operations in the world. The road was jammed with personnel streaming out of the NSA building following an order to evacuate. The air was thick with the sound of yelling, cellphones ringing, car engines revving vainly in the stationary traffic. The surreal spectacle of thousands of NSA intelligence agents abandoning their posts after the worst terrorist attack on the US, only to be bogged down in gridlock, made a deep impression on the teenager, Edward Snowden. As did 9/11 itself, which radically changed the course of his life. In its wake, Snowden became caught up in the surge of patriotism that swept the nation. Inspired to play his part, he joined the army, entered the intelligence community, and some 12 years after 9/11 found himself back at the same NSA where he had ground to a halt on that fateful day. The attacks on the Twin Towers and Pentagon had brought Snowden deep into the heart of America\u2019s secretive surveillance operations. But in the process it had given him access to highly classified databases that revealed to him a massive secret world, a sort of hidden state-within-the-state that had been created in the wake of 9/11. Snowden would go on to carry out the largest intelligence leak in the NSA\u2019s history. It would expose one of the great legacies of 9/11 \u2013 the rise of the ubiquitous US surveillance state. \u201cPanic made us politically vulnerable,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian as he ruminated on the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11. \u201cThat vulnerability was exploited by our own government to entitle itself to radically expanded powers that had for decades been out of reach.\u201d Snowden said that upon reflection the explosion of domestic spying post-9/11 should have been anticipated. \u201cWe should have known what was to come and, looking back at the public record, I think that on an intellectual level many of us did know. But political and media elites relentlessly repeated that the choice here was obvious: a guarantee of life or a certainty of death.\u201d That teenager on 9/11 is now an exile from his own country, charged under the Espionage Act for having revealed the US government\u2019s mass espionage on its own people. The way he sees it 20 years on, the false claim that expanding state power was necessary to avoid certain death from further terrorist atrocities has led to decades of public indifference. \u201cWith that framing, who could care whether or not the gloves came off the machinery of state? We are only now beginning to care again \u2013 to care collectively \u2013 because we sit at the bottom of a 20-year hole carved by our neglect.\u201d It happened in the blink of an eye. Within hours of the fourth plane crashing into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, George Bush\u2019s White House and intelligence chiefs had begun to lay the foundations of the mass surveillance state. The Patriot Act, which swatted away longstanding rules preventing the state from monitoring US citizens without \u201cprobable cause\u201d, was passed in a lightning-fast 45 days. The legislation became law with minimal debate or opposition in Congress, granting domestic law enforcement agencies sweeping new powers. It allowed the government to track the online behavior of Americans while making it much easier to acquire a warrant. It gave the green light for the FBI and CIA to carry out \u201croving wiretaps\u201d where agents could follow communications trails between phones and computers. It eviscerated the firewall that had been in place since the 1970s shielding US citizens from foreign surveillance. And it greatly boosted the power of the FBI to obtain personal customer records of Americans from phone companies, banks and internet providers without court approval through so-called National Security Letters. If the Patriot Act was produced in a flash, behind the scenes secret systems for mass surveillance were being built at even greater speed. One of the most audacious plans was drafted by nightfall on the day of 11 September itself\n\nquestion: What is the New York Times publishing about?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1107}, "You are an answer-extraction expert. Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Controversial NSA Surveillance Operations: Global Concerns and Political Vulnerability\n\nevidence: . The plan, ominously titled \u201cTotal information awareness\u201d, was the brainchild of John Poindexter, a disgraced former naval officer who had been Ronald Reagan\u2019s national security adviser and a key figure in the Iran-contra scandal. TIA, Poindexter blustered, would act as an early-warning alarm for future 9/11s by gathering up the digital data of all Americans \u2013 innocent or guilty \u2013 and using it to search for patterns of terrorist activity. No warrants would be sought. They would just do it, irrespective of laws or constitutional niceties. \u201cWe must put introduction of new technology on a wartime basis,\u201d Poindexter said. Weeks later he managed to sell the idea to the Pentagon in return for a $200m budget. The NSA wasn\u2019t far behind. The agency was busy devising Stellar Wind, its warrantless surveillance system. It sought to identify terrorist links by analysing the metadata drawn from the emails, telephone calls and internet activity of huge numbers of Americans. The Snowden documents showed that by 14 September \u2013 just three days after the attacks \u2013 the then director of the NSA, Michael Hayden, had taken a \u201ctactical decision\u201d to begin snooping on the digital communications of people based in the US. From now on, the NSA granted itself the power to surveil any American on US soil who was in digital contact with a foreign country where terrorism was known to exist \u2013 no warrant needed. This was a seismic shift. It meant that the nation\u2019s most powerful eavesdropping agency had ascribed to itself, without consulting Congress or the courts, the ability to listen in to the communications of Americans in a way that violated constitutional rights and laws. On 4 October 2001 the White House granted permission, again in secret and without consultation, for the NSA to turn its spotlight on to US citizens in what became known as the President\u2019s Surveillance Program. \u201cThey essentially claimed wartime authority to engage in domestic surveillance that is criminal under statutory law,\u201d said Ben Wizner, Snowden\u2019s lawyer, who works on surveillance at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). How could the spymasters have moved to put in place complex systems of mass surveillance just hours and days after 9/11? There is only one answer, many observers believe. \u201cThey had it all ready,\u201d said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which defends civil liberties in the digital space. \u201cThis is what the NSA had long wanted \u2013 to \u2018sit on the wire\u2019, to watch all internet traffic and pick out whatever they chose. Now they finally had the crisis they needed to make it happen.\u201d By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, an entire nation within the nation had arisen dedicated to keeping the American people nominally safe by placing everybody under observation. The Washington Post called it a \u201cTop Secret America hidden from public view\u201d. The sprawling surveillance infrastructure had proliferated to the extent that nobody \u2013 not even top intelligence officials \u2013 knew how much it cost or how many it employed. The Post\u2019s best estimate in July 2010 was that it spanned 10,000 locations across the US. The scale of growth can be glimpsed by looking at some of the public elements. The number of National Security Letters granted each year increased more than fourfold between 2000 and 2003, peaking at almost 60,000 the following year. By 2008 almost 20,000 people were being targeted under its remit. The intelligence budget grew from a little over $40bn a year in the late 1990s to almost $100bn by 2010, remaining $80bn to this day. When Wizner looks back on the past 20 years he is struck not just by this explosion in surveillance but also by the failure of governance that enabled it. Key institutions like the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court, which is supposed to provide legal oversight, genuflected in front of the NSA. \u201cThis is a story about checks and balances failing,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cThe courts deferred to the expertise and secrecy claims of the executive, Congress failed to hold the intelligence agencies accountable.\u201d Even the media fell short of holding power to account. When in 2005 the New York Times revealed the NSA\u2019s warrantless wiretapping, the newspaper admitted that it had sat on the story for a year at the behest of the White House. The LA Times spiked a story brought to it by a whistleblower who revealed that the telecom company AT&T had handed over all its internet traffic to the NSA. The paper had been lobbied by Hayden and the then director of national intelligence, John Negroponte. Traditional oversight did have some successes. Ron Wyden, a US senator for Oregon, managed to have Poindexter\u2019s Total Information Awareness program shut down in 2003, after an intern in his office stumbled across documents describing the operation. \u201cThat was one of our first wins \u2013\n\nquestion: What is the New York Times publishing about?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1101}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

(Three years later it was revealed that elements of the program had secretly been transferred from the Pentagon to the NSA.) Wyden, a longstanding member of the Senate select committee on intelligence, has been at the forefront of efforts to force sunlight into the world of secret surveillance. As the 10th anniversary of 9/11 was approaching he issued his famous warning on the Senate floor, telling the American people that when they found out how the government had interpreted the Patriot Act \u201cthey will be stunned and they will be angry\u201d. In another legendary moment two years later, he posed a direct question to the then director of national intelligence, James Clapper, about whether the NSA was collecting data on hundreds of millions of Americans. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d Clapper lied. Wyden told the Guardian that the exchange showed how far the government had allowed itself to slide in terms of basic American values. \u201cJames Clapper lied to the American people and he lied to the committee. It wasn\u2019t the only time they lied \u2013 they lied several times over the years, which is why I finally said I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I didn\u2019t ask the question I did in public.\u201d It is a paradox of Wyden\u2019s attempts to wrench surveillance into the open that despite his efforts the full truth about the massive dragnet of all Americans\u2019 digital communications remained concealed. As a member of the committee, the senator was briefed in secret about the warrantless eavesdropping but was constrained by what he has called the \u201ccumbersome and unwieldy\u201d restrictions on his public remarks. The Guardian asked Wyden whether he thought, with the benefit of hindsight over these past 20 years, that Congress could have done more to check the intelligence agencies. \u201cYou look back, and the answer is: sure. You keep pushing the rock up the hill and you have wins, and there are times when you wish there had been stronger support for reform.\u201d Before Edward Snowden there was Mark Klein. He was the whistleblower who exposed the AT&T story that the LA Times declined to publish. Klein was a technician assigned to the internet room of AT&T\u2019s Folsom Street building in San Francisco through which colossal quantities of data passed every hour. It was 2004 and unbeknown to the public the telecoms company had been bending over backwards since days after 9/11 to help the US government spy on its own people. As Klein went about routine maintenance, his eye was drawn to a splitter cabinet inside the room. It was dividing the light beam carrying the data into two separate signals, and passing one of them \u2013 an exact copy of the other \u2013 down to the floor below. Klein\u2019s curiosity intensified when he tried to follow the signal and found that the lower room was locked behind a door marked 641A. Nobody was allowed in without special authorization from the NSA. When Klein obtained internal engineering documents outlining the flow of data through the splitter cabinet down to the secret room, his suspicions were confirmed. The NSA was copying and collecting everybody\u2019s information carried not only by AT&T but also by 16 other internet providers who shared the pipeline. \u201cI was horrified and astonished. It was like a police state, sweeping up everybody\u2019s information blindly and allowing agents to go through it at their leisure.\u201d Klein\u2019s discovery was made public by Wired magazine in 2006. The documents he obtained went on to form the basis of a major lawsuit launched by the EFF, though in 2008 Congress passed a law absolving AT&T and other phone companies from any legal liability for collaborating with the spy chiefs. Mark Klein, Thomas Tamm, Thomas Drake, William Binney, Kirk Wiebe, Edward Loomis, Diane Roark \u2013 the list of individuals who, for a variety of motives, provided critical information to investigative journalists seeking to expose the surveillance state is long and impressive. Without them, given the failure of checks and balances, we might still be in the dark today. \u201cEverything we know about mass surveillance we know not because of our government institutions but despite them,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cWe know because of courageous sources and journalists who pried those stories out into the light.\u201d And then there was Snowden. On 6 June 2013 \u2013 almost 12 years after 9/11 \u2013 the first incendiary story exposing the NSA\u2019s dragnet of the telephone records of millions of Verizon customers was published by the Guardian. The next day the paper reported on Prism, a system for sucking up data from US internet giants including Google and Facebook. The lid on the secret US surveillance state had finally been lifted. One of the documents Snowden disclosed neatly encapsulated the NSA\u2019s posture: \u201cSniff It All, Know It All, Collect It All, Process It All, Exploit It All, Partner It All.\u201d Snowden has an even more\n\nquestion: What is the New York Times publishing about?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1081}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In his memoir Permanent Record he writes: \u201cAll of us had been reduced to something like children, who\u2019d be forced to live the rest of our lives under omniscient parental supervision.\u201d It is tempting to think of the mass surveillance put in place post-9/11 as a great leveler \u2013 after all, the NSA did grab the metadata of all Americans irrespective of race, class or religion. But to suggest that 9/11 gave birth to a new equality of snooping under the government\u2019s all-seeing eye would be a travesty. Surveillance has always fallen unevenly in the US, stretching back to the days when slaves were required to carry lanterns at night so they could be followed. After 9/11 it was the turn of Muslims. \u201cThe Patriot Act was the stepping stone for what became open season on American Muslims,\u201d said Nihad Awad, the executive director of the advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cThere were no rules. The government just said \u2018Let\u2019s go after Muslims.\u2019\u201d Before 9/11 Awad had been invited to sit on White House advisory committees. After 9/11 he and his family would routinely be stopped and searched at airports and treated like criminals. \u201cWe became the enemy,\u201d he said. For years Awad was puzzled by the hostile stories in the press containing personal details, the banks that refused to do business with him. He had to wait until Snowden to make sense of what was happening. An investigation by the Intercept based on the Snowden files showed that Awad had been placed on a top-secret list of 7,485 people, many foreigners but also including an unknown number of Americans, whose emails were being monitored by the NSA and FBI. They included other high-profile Muslim Americans including a former Republican candidate, a lawyer and university professors. \u201cWhen Snowden let us know that I was on the list I realized the government had access to my private emails and were sharing them with Congress and leaking them to the media,\u201d Awad said. \u201cI felt invaded by my own government, punished for leading a civil rights organization. If people like me in positions of influence were treated like this, what about the average Muslim?\u201d Asad Dandia was born and raised in Brooklyn. He was eight years-old on 9/11 and a teenager when his troubles started. As a religiously observant Muslim, he had founded with friends a food distribution charity offering help to struggling families from his community. In March 2012 he was contacted through Facebook by a stranger named Shamiur Rahman who said he wanted to volunteer for a spiritually grounded organization like his. Rahman said he had been through a rough patch himself and now wanted to help others. Dandia welcomed Rahman in. \u201cHe quickly grew close to me and to my circles,\u201d he said. \u201cHe met my family, he ate my mother\u2019s food, he slept over one night. We shared many intimate moments of emotional and spiritual reflection.\u201d At times Rahman behaved strangely. Whenever Dandia introduced him to anybody the first thing he would do would be to ask for their phone number. He also asked provocative questions, like what Dandia thought of the killing in Benghazi of Christopher Stevens, the US ambassador to Libya. \u201cThat was a really dumb question \u2013 it was murder and obviously we thought it was wrong,\u201d Dandia said. But he gave Rahman the benefit of the doubt. \u201cI attributed that to the fact he had mental health and drug addiction issues. I thought we should be patient with him.\u201d A few months after Rahman entered his life, Dandia was taken aside by a member of his local Muslim community who was working as an NYPD officer. \u201cYou are being watched, there\u2019s a file with your name and photos in it and you are being followed,\u201d he told Dandia. Seven months into their friendship, Rahman posted a confession on Facebook. He was an NYPD informant tasked with infiltrating Muslim groups and mosques. The news travelled fast and sent a chill throughout the area. Mosques asked Dandia to stop fundraising for his food bank as they were afraid of being targeted themselves. Dandia grew reclusive. \u201cIt made me suspicious of people. I hid my left-leaning political views and deeper religious commitments. That wasn\u2019t how I wanted to live, in a state of permanent paranoia, but there was a complete breakdown in trust.\u201d Through the Associated Press, Dandia came to learn that he was just a speck in the NYPD\u2019s mountainous surveillance of Muslims. Communities up and down the east coast were mapped through a secret \u201cDemographics Unit\u201d and individuals\u2019 daily habits \u2013 shopping, work, prayer, school \u2013 tracked on massive CIA-\n\nquestion: What is the New York Times publishing about?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1064}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Muslims with drug habits who fell into the NYPD\u2019s clutches, like Rahman, were offered lenient treatment in return for turning informant. \u201cI felt betrayed,\u201d Dandia said. \u201cI was born and raised in New York. This is the city that I love and that I\u2019m proud to call my home. It targeted me because of my religion, like a foreign enemy.\u201d Since Snowden shone his laser beam into the secret surveillance state-within-a-state, there has been a concerted effort to restore the balance, destroyed after 9/11, between individual liberties and national security. The USA Freedom Act in 2015 curtailed some of the NSA\u2019s metadata practices, passing the storage of bulk phone records from the agency to the phone companies, and opening up the foreign intelligence surveillance court to a modicum of public scrutiny. It was the first time since the 1970s that Congress had limited the NSA\u2019s authority in any way. \u201cWe have closed great swathes of the internet to the oldest methods of mass surveillance,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian. In 2019 the NSA let it be known that it had shut down its mass collection of phone and text records. The NSA cited \u201ctechnical irregularities\u201d, but by then it was widely known that the spying program had not only been illegal in its inception, it just hadn\u2019t worked. Despite the NSA\u2019s claim that by snooping on all Americans\u2019 communications it had thwarted numerous other 9/11s, the agency could only point to one terrorism case, that of Basaalay Moalin, found guilty of funding Somali extremism, that had come through the phone records program. Last year a federal judge concluded that even Moalin\u2019s case had been irrelevant: the NSA played no role in his conviction. There have been other victories in the battle against the surveillance state. Wyden was heartened by the vote in the Senate last year on his amendment to protect the browsing history of Americans from secret surveillance. The amendment failed, but by only one vote. \u201cI thought that was very telling, we almost won \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t have happened 15 years ago.\u201d Asad Dandia signed up to a class-action lawsuit challenging the NYPD\u2019s mass surveillance of him and so many other Muslim Americans. In 2016 they achieved a groundbreaking settlement that sharply reined in police targeting of religious and racial groups. \u201cI felt empowered, it gave me hope that Americans can push the country to live up to its own ideals,\u201d he said. Perhaps the biggest shift has been among the American people. The urge of individuals to protect themselves against state eavesdropping became so intense that tech giants were forced to respond and in 2016, for the first time since the internet was created, it carried more encrypted data than unencrypted. Which is not to say that the state-within-a-state has withered away, or that the balance between privacy and security has been perfected. \u201cNot even close,\u201d Cohn said. The Guardian asked surveillance experts what, in the present moment, keeps them up at night. What dastardly new tricks from the spymasters do they fear most? Wyden pointed to legal loopholes that allow shady private data brokers to sell Americans\u2019 personal information to government agencies without any court oversight. \u201cI continue to be very worried about that,\u201d he said. Snowden raised a similar shift, where mass surveillance is now predominantly performed by \u201camoral telecommunications and surveillance-masquerading-as-advertising companies. They exploit weaknesses in our laws, devices and networks to pad out their dossiers, and then sell them to governments.\u201d Cohn talked about how surveillance cameras were being weaponized with the addition of facial recognition technology that could have especially dire consequences for people of colour. Wizner said he sweated over the rise of robotic surveillance and AI. \u201cMore and more we will see critical decisions affecting liberty being made inside black boxes,\u201d he said. For Patrick Toomey of the ACLU\u2019s national security project, what keeps him up at night is simply all of it, the whole technological gamut. \u201cThe threat is persistent surveillance \u2013 of being surveilled wherever we go using a vast network of devices that can potentially listen to what we say, or recognize who we are based on our faces or the way we walk. There\u2019s a very real danger that this sensitive information will be used to make decisions that are discriminatory or inaccurate, that can profoundly impact our lives.\u201d In the last analysis, the US surveillance state got away with operating in total secret for so many years after 9/11 that it raises the question: are we still in the dark? \u201cThis will always be like trying to keep the kibble from the cat,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cSo long as they know what they want is out there somewhere, they\u2019re going\n\nquestion: What is the New York Times publishing about?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1068}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The framers of the Constitution recognized the threat a standing army posed to democracy and they sought to establish a government that guaranteed civilian supremacy over the military. This ideal was finally codified after the Civil War through the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibited the Army from engaging in law enforcement activities on U.S. soil. But Congress has weakened Posse Comitatus over the years by permitting military involvement in drug enforcement, border control and all sorts of other \u201cdomestic support\u201d operations. As a result, the military is increasingly turning its powerful intelligence collection capabilities against Americans. Total Information Awareness. Shortly after 9/11, the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began a project called \u201cTotal Information Awareness\u201d to collect and mine vast amounts of information about the American public, including their telephone records, bank records, medical records, and educational and travel data, in an attempt to identify terrorists. Congress de-funded TIA in 2003 in the wake of the public outcry denouncing such an Orwellian spying operation, but large scale information collection and data mining programs persist, and the military remains heavily involved. NSA\u2019s Warrantless Wiretapping Program. In December 2005 the New York Times revealed that soon after the September 11 attacks, former President Bush authorized the National Security Agency (NSA), an intelligence component of the Defense Department, to conduct warrantless surveillance of American\u2019s e-mails and telephone calls in blatant violation of a federal statute which prohibited the practice (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act). Subsequent articles in USA Today revealed that major telecommunications companies \u201cworking under contract to the NSA\u201d also provided the government with millions of Americans\u2019 domestic call data for \u201csocial network analysis.\u201d This warrantless surveillance program operated until January 2007. FISA Amendments Act Electronic Surveillance. In 2008 Congress passed a law called the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) which not only legalized the NSA\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program, it actually expanded the NSA\u2019s power to conduct warrantless, suspicion-less dragnet collection of American\u2019s international e-mails and telephone calls. Although very little is known about the government\u2019s implementation of its intrusive FAA spying powers, two New York Times articles (April and July 2009; LINK) revealed the NSA was collecting Americans\u2019 communications under the FAA by the millions and that it was improperly collecting purely domestic communications. National Security Letters. In 2007 an ACLU lawsuit revealed that DoD secretly issued hundreds of national security letters (NSLs) to obtain private and sensitive records of people within the United States without court approval. While the FBI has broad NSL powers and compliance with FBI-issued NSLs is mandatory, DoD\u2019s NSL power is more limited in scope, and, in most cases, compliance with DoD demands is not mandatory. A comprehensive analysis of 455 NSLs issued after 9/11 shows that the DoD seems to have collaborated with the FBI to circumvent the law to use FBI NSLs to obtain records DoD was not authorized to demand for its own investigations. TALON and The Counterintelligence Field Activity Agency (CIFA). But military spying goes far beyond the NSA and abuse of NSLs. In 2003 a highly secretive component of the DoD, the Counterintelligence Field Activity Agency (\u201cCIFA\u201d), began a program to track potential terrorist threats to Department personnel or property within the United States through Threat and Local Observation Notices (\u201cTALON\u201d). These TALON reports were designed to permit civilians and military personnel to report on suspicious activity near defense installations. Not surprisingly, the DOD soon strayed from this limited mission and TALON became a repository for information about peaceful anti-war protesters, and even Quakers. Reports were added to the database even when the \u201cthreat\u201d was an anti-war protest that occurred far from any military installation. Other \u201cthreats\u201d the military deemed non-credible were never removed from the database. CIFA was disbanded in 2008, but a new office at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) was opened to assume CIFA\u2019s \u201cresources and responsibilities.\u201d In May 2010 DoD announced it was going to participate in a new suspicious activity reporting program through the FBI\u2019s eGuardian program. Then, in June 2010 DIA published a federal register notice announcing the creation of a new data base for information on \u201cindividuals involved in, or of interest to, DoD intelligence, counterintelligence, counterterrorism and counter-narcotic operations or analytical projects as well as individuals involved in foreign intelligence and/or training activities\u201d \u2013 in short, what appears to be a de facto resurrection of the CIFA program. Political Protest Groups. DoD personnel have also been involved in illegal undercover operations targeting political protest groups.

He used a fake name and posed as a sympathizer for more than a year, all the while reporting the groups\u2019 activities to the local law enforcement agencies he worked with. While the military opened an internal investigation, a leaked 2009 Department of the Army document (\u201cConcept of Operations for Police Intelligence Operations\u201d) claims that Military Police Intelligence units are not subject to legal limitations on domestic military intelligence operations. Fusion Centers and JTTFs. The U.S. military is also involved in intelligence activities conducted through FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) and state and local intelligence fusion centers. For example, DoD is involved in a nationwide FBI investigation that targets returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans to determine if they have become right-wing extremists. DoD\u2019s role in this investigation is likely being coordinated through JTTFs. And though DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano reportedly told the New York Times \u201cthat fusion centers were not intended to have a military presence, and that she was not aware of ones that did,\u201d National Guard troops are present in many fusion centers; indeed, the ACLU documented U.S. Army presence at a Maryland fusion center in 2007. Moreover, in 2009 DHS announced it was giving state and local fusion centers access to classified military intelligence in DoD databases. An ongoing scandal involving military personnel and the Los Angeles County Terrorism Early Warning Center (LACTEW), one of the country\u2019s first fusion centers, highlights the lack of oversight in these joint intelligence operations. According to reports from the San Diego Union-Tribune, a group of military reservists and law enforcement officers led by the co-founder of the L.A. fusion center engaged in a years-long conspiracy to steal highly classified intelligence files from the Strategic Technical Operations Center located at the U.S. Marine Corps Base at Camp Pendleton, California and secret surveillance reports from the U.S. Northern Command headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Some of the stolen files reportedly \u201cpertained to surveillance of Muslim communities in Southern California,\u201d including mosques in Los Angeles and San Diego, and revealed \u201ca federal surveillance program targeting Muslim groups\u201d in the United States. The scheme apparently began in 2001 when the LACTEW fusion center\u2019s co-founder called a civilian analyst at U.S. Northern Command to ask that she surreptitiously supply the LACTEW with military surveillance reports. The reported involvement of the National Security Agency in the investigation hints that these records may relate to warrantless domestic surveillance operations conducted by the military. \u00ab Back to Suspicious Activity Reporting Programs | Go To Spy Files \u00bb Every month, you'll receive regular roundups of the most important civil rights and civil liberties developments.

It was a beautiful day under a sparkling blue sky, and as he sped down Maryland\u2019s Route 32 with the window down and radio blasting, the teenager was sure it was going to be a lucky day. Soon after 8.46am the radio cut to news that a plane had crashed into one of the Twin Towers in New York City. At 9.03am, by now at his desk, he was stunned to hear that a second plane had crashed into the other tower, followed half an hour later by similar catastrophe at the Pentagon in Washington. He leapt back into his car and screeched into reverse, only to find himself stuck in gridlocked traffic sandwiched between hundreds of other vehicles. He was stuck outside the headquarters of the National Security Agency (NSA), the US intelligence body that runs one of the largest surveillance operations in the world. The road was jammed with personnel streaming out of the NSA building following an order to evacuate. The air was thick with the sound of yelling, cellphones ringing, car engines revving vainly in the stationary traffic. The surreal spectacle of thousands of NSA intelligence agents abandoning their posts after the worst terrorist attack on the US, only to be bogged down in gridlock, made a deep impression on the teenager, Edward Snowden. As did 9/11 itself, which radically changed the course of his life. In its wake, Snowden became caught up in the surge of patriotism that swept the nation. Inspired to play his part, he joined the army, entered the intelligence community, and some 12 years after 9/11 found himself back at the same NSA where he had ground to a halt on that fateful day. The attacks on the Twin Towers and Pentagon had brought Snowden deep into the heart of America\u2019s secretive surveillance operations. But in the process it had given him access to highly classified databases that revealed to him a massive secret world, a sort of hidden state-within-the-state that had been created in the wake of 9/11. Snowden would go on to carry out the largest intelligence leak in the NSA\u2019s history. It would expose one of the great legacies of 9/11 \u2013 the rise of the ubiquitous US surveillance state. \u201cPanic made us politically vulnerable,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian as he ruminated on the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11. \u201cThat vulnerability was exploited by our own government to entitle itself to radically expanded powers that had for decades been out of reach.\u201d Snowden said that upon reflection the explosion of domestic spying post-9/11 should have been anticipated. \u201cWe should have known what was to come and, looking back at the public record, I think that on an intellectual level many of us did know. But political and media elites relentlessly repeated that the choice here was obvious: a guarantee of life or a certainty of death.\u201d That teenager on 9/11 is now an exile from his own country, charged under the Espionage Act for having revealed the US government\u2019s mass espionage on its own people. The way he sees it 20 years on, the false claim that expanding state power was necessary to avoid certain death from further terrorist atrocities has led to decades of public indifference. \u201cWith that framing, who could care whether or not the gloves came off the machinery of state? We are only now beginning to care again \u2013 to care collectively \u2013 because we sit at the bottom of a 20-year hole carved by our neglect.\u201d It happened in the blink of an eye. Within hours of the fourth plane crashing into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, George Bush\u2019s White House and intelligence chiefs had begun to lay the foundations of the mass surveillance state. The Patriot Act, which swatted away longstanding rules preventing the state from monitoring US citizens without \u201cprobable cause\u201d, was passed in a lightning-fast 45 days. The legislation became law with minimal debate or opposition in Congress, granting domestic law enforcement agencies sweeping new powers. It allowed the government to track the online behavior of Americans while making it much easier to acquire a warrant. It gave the green light for the FBI and CIA to carry out \u201croving wiretaps\u201d where agents could follow communications trails between phones and computers. It eviscerated the firewall that had been in place since the 1970s shielding US citizens from foreign surveillance. And it greatly boosted the power of the FBI to obtain personal customer records of Americans from phone companies, banks and internet providers without court approval through so-called National Security Letters. If the Patriot Act was produced in a flash, behind the scenes secret systems for mass surveillance were being built at even greater speed. One of the most audacious plans was drafted by nightfall on the day of 11 September itself\n\nquestion: What did the revelations in 2013 about NSA mass surveillance result in?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Edward Snowden exposed the government\u2019s mass espionage on its own people.", "usage": 1124}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Controversial NSA Surveillance Operations: Global Concerns and Political Vulnerability\n\nevidence: . The plan, ominously titled \u201cTotal information awareness\u201d, was the brainchild of John Poindexter, a disgraced former naval officer who had been Ronald Reagan\u2019s national security adviser and a key figure in the Iran-contra scandal. TIA, Poindexter blustered, would act as an early-warning alarm for future 9/11s by gathering up the digital data of all Americans \u2013 innocent or guilty \u2013 and using it to search for patterns of terrorist activity. No warrants would be sought. They would just do it, irrespective of laws or constitutional niceties. \u201cWe must put introduction of new technology on a wartime basis,\u201d Poindexter said. Weeks later he managed to sell the idea to the Pentagon in return for a $200m budget. The NSA wasn\u2019t far behind. The agency was busy devising Stellar Wind, its warrantless surveillance system. It sought to identify terrorist links by analysing the metadata drawn from the emails, telephone calls and internet activity of huge numbers of Americans. The Snowden documents showed that by 14 September \u2013 just three days after the attacks \u2013 the then director of the NSA, Michael Hayden, had taken a \u201ctactical decision\u201d to begin snooping on the digital communications of people based in the US. From now on, the NSA granted itself the power to surveil any American on US soil who was in digital contact with a foreign country where terrorism was known to exist \u2013 no warrant needed. This was a seismic shift. It meant that the nation\u2019s most powerful eavesdropping agency had ascribed to itself, without consulting Congress or the courts, the ability to listen in to the communications of Americans in a way that violated constitutional rights and laws. On 4 October 2001 the White House granted permission, again in secret and without consultation, for the NSA to turn its spotlight on to US citizens in what became known as the President\u2019s Surveillance Program. \u201cThey essentially claimed wartime authority to engage in domestic surveillance that is criminal under statutory law,\u201d said Ben Wizner, Snowden\u2019s lawyer, who works on surveillance at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). How could the spymasters have moved to put in place complex systems of mass surveillance just hours and days after 9/11? There is only one answer, many observers believe. \u201cThey had it all ready,\u201d said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which defends civil liberties in the digital space. \u201cThis is what the NSA had long wanted \u2013 to \u2018sit on the wire\u2019, to watch all internet traffic and pick out whatever they chose. Now they finally had the crisis they needed to make it happen.\u201d By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, an entire nation within the nation had arisen dedicated to keeping the American people nominally safe by placing everybody under observation. The Washington Post called it a \u201cTop Secret America hidden from public view\u201d. The sprawling surveillance infrastructure had proliferated to the extent that nobody \u2013 not even top intelligence officials \u2013 knew how much it cost or how many it employed. The Post\u2019s best estimate in July 2010 was that it spanned 10,000 locations across the US. The scale of growth can be glimpsed by looking at some of the public elements. The number of National Security Letters granted each year increased more than fourfold between 2000 and 2003, peaking at almost 60,000 the following year. By 2008 almost 20,000 people were being targeted under its remit. The intelligence budget grew from a little over $40bn a year in the late 1990s to almost $100bn by 2010, remaining $80bn to this day. When Wizner looks back on the past 20 years he is struck not just by this explosion in surveillance but also by the failure of governance that enabled it. Key institutions like the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court, which is supposed to provide legal oversight, genuflected in front of the NSA. \u201cThis is a story about checks and balances failing,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cThe courts deferred to the expertise and secrecy claims of the executive, Congress failed to hold the intelligence agencies accountable.\u201d Even the media fell short of holding power to account. When in 2005 the New York Times revealed the NSA\u2019s warrantless wiretapping, the newspaper admitted that it had sat on the story for a year at the behest of the White House. The LA Times spiked a story brought to it by a whistleblower who revealed that the telecom company AT&T had handed over all its internet traffic to the NSA. The paper had been lobbied by Hayden and the then director of national intelligence, John Negroponte. Traditional oversight did have some successes. Ron Wyden, a US senator for Oregon, managed to have Poindexter\u2019s Total Information Awareness program shut down in 2003, after an intern in his office stumbled across documents describing the operation. \u201cThat was one of our first wins \u2013\n\nquestion: What did the revelations in 2013 about NSA mass surveillance result in?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Noans", "usage": 1107}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

(Three years later it was revealed that elements of the program had secretly been transferred from the Pentagon to the NSA.) Wyden, a longstanding member of the Senate select committee on intelligence, has been at the forefront of efforts to force sunlight into the world of secret surveillance. As the 10th anniversary of 9/11 was approaching he issued his famous warning on the Senate floor, telling the American people that when they found out how the government had interpreted the Patriot Act \u201cthey will be stunned and they will be angry\u201d. In another legendary moment two years later, he posed a direct question to the then director of national intelligence, James Clapper, about whether the NSA was collecting data on hundreds of millions of Americans. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d Clapper lied. Wyden told the Guardian that the exchange showed how far the government had allowed itself to slide in terms of basic American values. \u201cJames Clapper lied to the American people and he lied to the committee. It wasn\u2019t the only time they lied \u2013 they lied several times over the years, which is why I finally said I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I didn\u2019t ask the question I did in public.\u201d It is a paradox of Wyden\u2019s attempts to wrench surveillance into the open that despite his efforts the full truth about the massive dragnet of all Americans\u2019 digital communications remained concealed. As a member of the committee, the senator was briefed in secret about the warrantless eavesdropping but was constrained by what he has called the \u201ccumbersome and unwieldy\u201d restrictions on his public remarks. The Guardian asked Wyden whether he thought, with the benefit of hindsight over these past 20 years, that Congress could have done more to check the intelligence agencies. \u201cYou look back, and the answer is: sure. You keep pushing the rock up the hill and you have wins, and there are times when you wish there had been stronger support for reform.\u201d Before Edward Snowden there was Mark Klein. He was the whistleblower who exposed the AT&T story that the LA Times declined to publish. Klein was a technician assigned to the internet room of AT&T\u2019s Folsom Street building in San Francisco through which colossal quantities of data passed every hour. It was 2004 and unbeknown to the public the telecoms company had been bending over backwards since days after 9/11 to help the US government spy on its own people. As Klein went about routine maintenance, his eye was drawn to a splitter cabinet inside the room. It was dividing the light beam carrying the data into two separate signals, and passing one of them \u2013 an exact copy of the other \u2013 down to the floor below. Klein\u2019s curiosity intensified when he tried to follow the signal and found that the lower room was locked behind a door marked 641A. Nobody was allowed in without special authorization from the NSA. When Klein obtained internal engineering documents outlining the flow of data through the splitter cabinet down to the secret room, his suspicions were confirmed. The NSA was copying and collecting everybody\u2019s information carried not only by AT&T but also by 16 other internet providers who shared the pipeline. \u201cI was horrified and astonished. It was like a police state, sweeping up everybody\u2019s information blindly and allowing agents to go through it at their leisure.\u201d Klein\u2019s discovery was made public by Wired magazine in 2006. The documents he obtained went on to form the basis of a major lawsuit launched by the EFF, though in 2008 Congress passed a law absolving AT&T and other phone companies from any legal liability for collaborating with the spy chiefs. Mark Klein, Thomas Tamm, Thomas Drake, William Binney, Kirk Wiebe, Edward Loomis, Diane Roark \u2013 the list of individuals who, for a variety of motives, provided critical information to investigative journalists seeking to expose the surveillance state is long and impressive. Without them, given the failure of checks and balances, we might still be in the dark today. \u201cEverything we know about mass surveillance we know not because of our government institutions but despite them,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cWe know because of courageous sources and journalists who pried those stories out into the light.\u201d And then there was Snowden. On 6 June 2013 \u2013 almost 12 years after 9/11 \u2013 the first incendiary story exposing the NSA\u2019s dragnet of the telephone records of millions of Verizon customers was published by the Guardian. The next day the paper reported on Prism, a system for sucking up data from US internet giants including Google and Facebook. The lid on the secret US surveillance state had finally been lifted. One of the documents Snowden disclosed neatly encapsulated the NSA\u2019s posture: \u201cSniff It All, Know It All, Collect It All, Process It All, Exploit It All, Partner It All.\u201d Snowden has an even more\n\nquestion: What did the revelations in 2013 about NSA mass surveillance result in?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The revelations in 2013 about NSA mass surveillance resulted in the first incendiary story exposing the NSA\u2019s dragnet of the telephone records of millions of Verizon customers and Prism, a system for sucking up data from US internet giants including Google and Facebook.", "usage": 1136}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In his memoir Permanent Record he writes: \u201cAll of us had been reduced to something like children, who\u2019d be forced to live the rest of our lives under omniscient parental supervision.\u201d It is tempting to think of the mass surveillance put in place post-9/11 as a great leveler \u2013 after all, the NSA did grab the metadata of all Americans irrespective of race, class or religion. But to suggest that 9/11 gave birth to a new equality of snooping under the government\u2019s all-seeing eye would be a travesty. Surveillance has always fallen unevenly in the US, stretching back to the days when slaves were required to carry lanterns at night so they could be followed. After 9/11 it was the turn of Muslims. \u201cThe Patriot Act was the stepping stone for what became open season on American Muslims,\u201d said Nihad Awad, the executive director of the advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cThere were no rules. The government just said \u2018Let\u2019s go after Muslims.\u2019\u201d Before 9/11 Awad had been invited to sit on White House advisory committees. After 9/11 he and his family would routinely be stopped and searched at airports and treated like criminals. \u201cWe became the enemy,\u201d he said. For years Awad was puzzled by the hostile stories in the press containing personal details, the banks that refused to do business with him. He had to wait until Snowden to make sense of what was happening. An investigation by the Intercept based on the Snowden files showed that Awad had been placed on a top-secret list of 7,485 people, many foreigners but also including an unknown number of Americans, whose emails were being monitored by the NSA and FBI. They included other high-profile Muslim Americans including a former Republican candidate, a lawyer and university professors. \u201cWhen Snowden let us know that I was on the list I realized the government had access to my private emails and were sharing them with Congress and leaking them to the media,\u201d Awad said. \u201cI felt invaded by my own government, punished for leading a civil rights organization. If people like me in positions of influence were treated like this, what about the average Muslim?\u201d Asad Dandia was born and raised in Brooklyn. He was eight years-old on 9/11 and a teenager when his troubles started. As a religiously observant Muslim, he had founded with friends a food distribution charity offering help to struggling families from his community. In March 2012 he was contacted through Facebook by a stranger named Shamiur Rahman who said he wanted to volunteer for a spiritually grounded organization like his. Rahman said he had been through a rough patch himself and now wanted to help others. Dandia welcomed Rahman in. \u201cHe quickly grew close to me and to my circles,\u201d he said. \u201cHe met my family, he ate my mother\u2019s food, he slept over one night. We shared many intimate moments of emotional and spiritual reflection.\u201d At times Rahman behaved strangely. Whenever Dandia introduced him to anybody the first thing he would do would be to ask for their phone number. He also asked provocative questions, like what Dandia thought of the killing in Benghazi of Christopher Stevens, the US ambassador to Libya. \u201cThat was a really dumb question \u2013 it was murder and obviously we thought it was wrong,\u201d Dandia said. But he gave Rahman the benefit of the doubt. \u201cI attributed that to the fact he had mental health and drug addiction issues. I thought we should be patient with him.\u201d A few months after Rahman entered his life, Dandia was taken aside by a member of his local Muslim community who was working as an NYPD officer. \u201cYou are being watched, there\u2019s a file with your name and photos in it and you are being followed,\u201d he told Dandia. Seven months into their friendship, Rahman posted a confession on Facebook. He was an NYPD informant tasked with infiltrating Muslim groups and mosques. The news travelled fast and sent a chill throughout the area. Mosques asked Dandia to stop fundraising for his food bank as they were afraid of being targeted themselves. Dandia grew reclusive. \u201cIt made me suspicious of people. I hid my left-leaning political views and deeper religious commitments. That wasn\u2019t how I wanted to live, in a state of permanent paranoia, but there was a complete breakdown in trust.\u201d Through the Associated Press, Dandia came to learn that he was just a speck in the NYPD\u2019s mountainous surveillance of Muslims. Communities up and down the east coast were mapped through a secret \u201cDemographics Unit\u201d and individuals\u2019 daily habits \u2013 shopping, work, prayer, school \u2013 tracked on massive CIA-\n\nquestion: What did the revelations in 2013 about NSA mass surveillance result in?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1070}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This is the city that I love and that I\u2019m proud to call my home. It targeted me because of my religion, like a foreign enemy.\u201d Since Snowden shone his laser beam into the secret surveillance state-within-a-state, there has been a concerted effort to restore the balance, destroyed after 9/11, between individual liberties and national security. The USA Freedom Act in 2015 curtailed some of the NSA\u2019s metadata practices, passing the storage of bulk phone records from the agency to the phone companies, and opening up the foreign intelligence surveillance court to a modicum of public scrutiny. It was the first time since the 1970s that Congress had limited the NSA\u2019s authority in any way. \u201cWe have closed great swathes of the internet to the oldest methods of mass surveillance,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian. In 2019 the NSA let it be known that it had shut down its mass collection of phone and text records. The NSA cited \u201ctechnical irregularities\u201d, but by then it was widely known that the spying program had not only been illegal in its inception, it just hadn\u2019t worked. Despite the NSA\u2019s claim that by snooping on all Americans\u2019 communications it had thwarted numerous other 9/11s, the agency could only point to one terrorism case, that of Basaalay Moalin, found guilty of funding Somali extremism, that had come through the phone records program. Last year a federal judge concluded that even Moalin\u2019s case had been irrelevant: the NSA played no role in his conviction. There have been other victories in the battle against the surveillance state. Wyden was heartened by the vote in the Senate last year on his amendment to protect the browsing history of Americans from secret surveillance. The amendment failed, but by only one vote. \u201cI thought that was very telling, we almost won \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t have happened 15 years ago.\u201d Asad Dandia signed up to a class-action lawsuit challenging the NYPD\u2019s mass surveillance of him and so many other Muslim Americans. In 2016 they achieved a groundbreaking settlement that sharply reined in police targeting of religious and racial groups. \u201cI felt empowered, it gave me hope that Americans can push the country to live up to its own ideals,\u201d he said. Perhaps the biggest shift has been among the American people. The urge of individuals to protect themselves against state eavesdropping became so intense that tech giants were forced to respond and in 2016, for the first time since the internet was created, it carried more encrypted data than unencrypted. Which is not to say that the state-within-a-state has withered away, or that the balance between privacy and security has been perfected. \u201cNot even close,\u201d Cohn said. The Guardian asked surveillance experts what, in the present moment, keeps them up at night. What dastardly new tricks from the spymasters do they fear most? Wyden pointed to legal loopholes that allow shady private data brokers to sell Americans\u2019 personal information to government agencies without any court oversight. \u201cI continue to be very worried about that,\u201d he said. Snowden raised a similar shift, where mass surveillance is now predominantly performed by \u201camoral telecommunications and surveillance-masquerading-as-advertising companies. They exploit weaknesses in our laws, devices and networks to pad out their dossiers, and then sell them to governments.\u201d Cohn talked about how surveillance cameras were being weaponized with the addition of facial recognition technology that could have especially dire consequences for people of colour. Wizner said he sweated over the rise of robotic surveillance and AI. \u201cMore and more we will see critical decisions affecting liberty being made inside black boxes,\u201d he said. For Patrick Toomey of the ACLU\u2019s national security project, what keeps him up at night is simply all of it, the whole technological gamut. \u201cThe threat is persistent surveillance \u2013 of being surveilled wherever we go using a vast network of devices that can potentially listen to what we say, or recognize who we are based on our faces or the way we walk. There\u2019s a very real danger that this sensitive information will be used to make decisions that are discriminatory or inaccurate, that can profoundly impact our lives.\u201d In the last analysis, the US surveillance state got away with operating in total secret for so many years after 9/11 that it raises the question: are we still in the dark? \u201cThis will always be like trying to keep the kibble from the cat,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cSo long as they know what they want is out there somewhere, they\u2019re going\n\nquestion: What did the revelations in 2013 about NSA mass surveillance result in?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "It resulted in the USA Freedom Act in 2015 which curtailed some of the NSA\u2019s metadata practices.", "usage": 1095}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The framers of the Constitution recognized the threat a standing army posed to democracy and they sought to establish a government that guaranteed civilian supremacy over the military. This ideal was finally codified after the Civil War through the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibited the Army from engaging in law enforcement activities on U.S. soil. But Congress has weakened Posse Comitatus over the years by permitting military involvement in drug enforcement, border control and all sorts of other \u201cdomestic support\u201d operations. As a result, the military is increasingly turning its powerful intelligence collection capabilities against Americans. Total Information Awareness. Shortly after 9/11, the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began a project called \u201cTotal Information Awareness\u201d to collect and mine vast amounts of information about the American public, including their telephone records, bank records, medical records, and educational and travel data, in an attempt to identify terrorists. Congress de-funded TIA in 2003 in the wake of the public outcry denouncing such an Orwellian spying operation, but large scale information collection and data mining programs persist, and the military remains heavily involved. NSA\u2019s Warrantless Wiretapping Program. In December 2005 the New York Times revealed that soon after the September 11 attacks, former President Bush authorized the National Security Agency (NSA), an intelligence component of the Defense Department, to conduct warrantless surveillance of American\u2019s e-mails and telephone calls in blatant violation of a federal statute which prohibited the practice (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act). Subsequent articles in USA Today revealed that major telecommunications companies \u201cworking under contract to the NSA\u201d also provided the government with millions of Americans\u2019 domestic call data for \u201csocial network analysis.\u201d This warrantless surveillance program operated until January 2007. FISA Amendments Act Electronic Surveillance. In 2008 Congress passed a law called the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) which not only legalized the NSA\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program, it actually expanded the NSA\u2019s power to conduct warrantless, suspicion-less dragnet collection of American\u2019s international e-mails and telephone calls. Although very little is known about the government\u2019s implementation of its intrusive FAA spying powers, two New York Times articles (April and July 2009; LINK) revealed the NSA was collecting Americans\u2019 communications under the FAA by the millions and that it was improperly collecting purely domestic communications. National Security Letters. In 2007 an ACLU lawsuit revealed that DoD secretly issued hundreds of national security letters (NSLs) to obtain private and sensitive records of people within the United States without court approval. While the FBI has broad NSL powers and compliance with FBI-issued NSLs is mandatory, DoD\u2019s NSL power is more limited in scope, and, in most cases, compliance with DoD demands is not mandatory. A comprehensive analysis of 455 NSLs issued after 9/11 shows that the DoD seems to have collaborated with the FBI to circumvent the law to use FBI NSLs to obtain records DoD was not authorized to demand for its own investigations. TALON and The Counterintelligence Field Activity Agency (CIFA). But military spying goes far beyond the NSA and abuse of NSLs. In 2003 a highly secretive component of the DoD, the Counterintelligence Field Activity Agency (\u201cCIFA\u201d), began a program to track potential terrorist threats to Department personnel or property within the United States through Threat and Local Observation Notices (\u201cTALON\u201d). These TALON reports were designed to permit civilians and military personnel to report on suspicious activity near defense installations. Not surprisingly, the DOD soon strayed from this limited mission and TALON became a repository for information about peaceful anti-war protesters, and even Quakers. Reports were added to the database even when the \u201cthreat\u201d was an anti-war protest that occurred far from any military installation. Other \u201cthreats\u201d the military deemed non-credible were never removed from the database. CIFA was disbanded in 2008, but a new office at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) was opened to assume CIFA\u2019s \u201cresources and responsibilities.\u201d In May 2010 DoD announced it was going to participate in a new suspicious activity reporting program through the FBI\u2019s eGuardian program. Then, in June 2010 DIA published a federal register notice announcing the creation of a new data base for information on \u201cindividuals involved in, or of interest to, DoD intelligence, counterintelligence, counterterrorism and counter-narcotic operations or analytical projects as well as individuals involved in foreign intelligence and/or training activities\u201d \u2013 in short, what appears to be a de facto resurrection of the CIFA program.

He used a fake name and posed as a sympathizer for more than a year, all the while reporting the groups\u2019 activities to the local law enforcement agencies he worked with. While the military opened an internal investigation, a leaked 2009 Department of the Army document (\u201cConcept of Operations for Police Intelligence Operations\u201d) claims that Military Police Intelligence units are not subject to legal limitations on domestic military intelligence operations. Fusion Centers and JTTFs. The U.S. military is also involved in intelligence activities conducted through FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) and state and local intelligence fusion centers. For example, DoD is involved in a nationwide FBI investigation that targets returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans to determine if they have become right-wing extremists. DoD\u2019s role in this investigation is likely being coordinated through JTTFs. And though DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano reportedly told the New York Times \u201cthat fusion centers were not intended to have a military presence, and that she was not aware of ones that did,\u201d National Guard troops are present in many fusion centers; indeed, the ACLU documented U.S. Army presence at a Maryland fusion center in 2007. Moreover, in 2009 DHS announced it was giving state and local fusion centers access to classified military intelligence in DoD databases. An ongoing scandal involving military personnel and the Los Angeles County Terrorism Early Warning Center (LACTEW), one of the country\u2019s first fusion centers, highlights the lack of oversight in these joint intelligence operations. According to reports from the San Diego Union-Tribune, a group of military reservists and law enforcement officers led by the co-founder of the L.A. fusion center engaged in a years-long conspiracy to steal highly classified intelligence files from the Strategic Technical Operations Center located at the U.S. Marine Corps Base at Camp Pendleton, California and secret surveillance reports from the U.S. Northern Command headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Some of the stolen files reportedly \u201cpertained to surveillance of Muslim communities in Southern California,\u201d including mosques in Los Angeles and San Diego, and revealed \u201ca federal surveillance program targeting Muslim groups\u201d in the United States. The scheme apparently began in 2001 when the LACTEW fusion center\u2019s co-founder called a civilian analyst at U.S. Northern Command to ask that she surreptitiously supply the LACTEW with military surveillance reports. The reported involvement of the National Security Agency in the investigation hints that these records may relate to warrantless domestic surveillance operations conducted by the military. \u00ab Back to Suspicious Activity Reporting Programs | Go To Spy Files \u00bb Every month, you'll receive regular roundups of the most important civil rights and civil liberties developments.

It was a beautiful day under a sparkling blue sky, and as he sped down Maryland\u2019s Route 32 with the window down and radio blasting, the teenager was sure it was going to be a lucky day. Soon after 8.46am the radio cut to news that a plane had crashed into one of the Twin Towers in New York City. At 9.03am, by now at his desk, he was stunned to hear that a second plane had crashed into the other tower, followed half an hour later by similar catastrophe at the Pentagon in Washington. He leapt back into his car and screeched into reverse, only to find himself stuck in gridlocked traffic sandwiched between hundreds of other vehicles. He was stuck outside the headquarters of the National Security Agency (NSA), the US intelligence body that runs one of the largest surveillance operations in the world. The road was jammed with personnel streaming out of the NSA building following an order to evacuate. The air was thick with the sound of yelling, cellphones ringing, car engines revving vainly in the stationary traffic. The surreal spectacle of thousands of NSA intelligence agents abandoning their posts after the worst terrorist attack on the US, only to be bogged down in gridlock, made a deep impression on the teenager, Edward Snowden. As did 9/11 itself, which radically changed the course of his life. In its wake, Snowden became caught up in the surge of patriotism that swept the nation. Inspired to play his part, he joined the army, entered the intelligence community, and some 12 years after 9/11 found himself back at the same NSA where he had ground to a halt on that fateful day. The attacks on the Twin Towers and Pentagon had brought Snowden deep into the heart of America\u2019s secretive surveillance operations. But in the process it had given him access to highly classified databases that revealed to him a massive secret world, a sort of hidden state-within-the-state that had been created in the wake of 9/11. Snowden would go on to carry out the largest intelligence leak in the NSA\u2019s history. It would expose one of the great legacies of 9/11 \u2013 the rise of the ubiquitous US surveillance state. \u201cPanic made us politically vulnerable,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian as he ruminated on the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11. \u201cThat vulnerability was exploited by our own government to entitle itself to radically expanded powers that had for decades been out of reach.\u201d Snowden said that upon reflection the explosion of domestic spying post-9/11 should have been anticipated. \u201cWe should have known what was to come and, looking back at the public record, I think that on an intellectual level many of us did know. But political and media elites relentlessly repeated that the choice here was obvious: a guarantee of life or a certainty of death.\u201d That teenager on 9/11 is now an exile from his own country, charged under the Espionage Act for having revealed the US government\u2019s mass espionage on its own people. The way he sees it 20 years on, the false claim that expanding state power was necessary to avoid certain death from further terrorist atrocities has led to decades of public indifference. \u201cWith that framing, who could care whether or not the gloves came off the machinery of state? We are only now beginning to care again \u2013 to care collectively \u2013 because we sit at the bottom of a 20-year hole carved by our neglect.\u201d It happened in the blink of an eye. Within hours of the fourth plane crashing into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, George Bush\u2019s White House and intelligence chiefs had begun to lay the foundations of the mass surveillance state. The Patriot Act, which swatted away longstanding rules preventing the state from monitoring US citizens without \u201cprobable cause\u201d, was passed in a lightning-fast 45 days. The legislation became law with minimal debate or opposition in Congress, granting domestic law enforcement agencies sweeping new powers. It allowed the government to track the online behavior of Americans while making it much easier to acquire a warrant. It gave the green light for the FBI and CIA to carry out \u201croving wiretaps\u201d where agents could follow communications trails between phones and computers. It eviscerated the firewall that had been in place since the 1970s shielding US citizens from foreign surveillance. And it greatly boosted the power of the FBI to obtain personal customer records of Americans from phone companies, banks and internet providers without court approval through so-called National Security Letters. If the Patriot Act was produced in a flash, behind the scenes secret systems for mass surveillance were being built at even greater speed. One of the most audacious plans was drafted by nightfall on the day of 11 September itself\n\nquestion: Who leaked classified information about NSA surveillance operations?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Edward Snowden", "usage": 1107}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The plan, ominously titled \u201cTotal information awareness\u201d, was the brainchild of John Poindexter, a disgraced former naval officer who had been Ronald Reagan\u2019s national security adviser and a key figure in the Iran-contra scandal. TIA, Poindexter blustered, would act as an early-warning alarm for future 9/11s by gathering up the digital data of all Americans \u2013 innocent or guilty \u2013 and using it to search for patterns of terrorist activity. No warrants would be sought. They would just do it, irrespective of laws or constitutional niceties. \u201cWe must put introduction of new technology on a wartime basis,\u201d Poindexter said. Weeks later he managed to sell the idea to the Pentagon in return for a $200m budget. The NSA wasn\u2019t far behind. The agency was busy devising Stellar Wind, its warrantless surveillance system. It sought to identify terrorist links by analysing the metadata drawn from the emails, telephone calls and internet activity of huge numbers of Americans. The Snowden documents showed that by 14 September \u2013 just three days after the attacks \u2013 the then director of the NSA, Michael Hayden, had taken a \u201ctactical decision\u201d to begin snooping on the digital communications of people based in the US. From now on, the NSA granted itself the power to surveil any American on US soil who was in digital contact with a foreign country where terrorism was known to exist \u2013 no warrant needed. This was a seismic shift. It meant that the nation\u2019s most powerful eavesdropping agency had ascribed to itself, without consulting Congress or the courts, the ability to listen in to the communications of Americans in a way that violated constitutional rights and laws. On 4 October 2001 the White House granted permission, again in secret and without consultation, for the NSA to turn its spotlight on to US citizens in what became known as the President\u2019s Surveillance Program. \u201cThey essentially claimed wartime authority to engage in domestic surveillance that is criminal under statutory law,\u201d said Ben Wizner, Snowden\u2019s lawyer, who works on surveillance at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). How could the spymasters have moved to put in place complex systems of mass surveillance just hours and days after 9/11? There is only one answer, many observers believe. \u201cThey had it all ready,\u201d said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which defends civil liberties in the digital space. \u201cThis is what the NSA had long wanted \u2013 to \u2018sit on the wire\u2019, to watch all internet traffic and pick out whatever they chose. Now they finally had the crisis they needed to make it happen.\u201d By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, an entire nation within the nation had arisen dedicated to keeping the American people nominally safe by placing everybody under observation. The Washington Post called it a \u201cTop Secret America hidden from public view\u201d. The sprawling surveillance infrastructure had proliferated to the extent that nobody \u2013 not even top intelligence officials \u2013 knew how much it cost or how many it employed. The Post\u2019s best estimate in July 2010 was that it spanned 10,000 locations across the US. The scale of growth can be glimpsed by looking at some of the public elements. The number of National Security Letters granted each year increased more than fourfold between 2000 and 2003, peaking at almost 60,000 the following year. By 2008 almost 20,000 people were being targeted under its remit. The intelligence budget grew from a little over $40bn a year in the late 1990s to almost $100bn by 2010, remaining $80bn to this day. When Wizner looks back on the past 20 years he is struck not just by this explosion in surveillance but also by the failure of governance that enabled it. Key institutions like the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court, which is supposed to provide legal oversight, genuflected in front of the NSA. \u201cThis is a story about checks and balances failing,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cThe courts deferred to the expertise and secrecy claims of the executive, Congress failed to hold the intelligence agencies accountable.\u201d Even the media fell short of holding power to account. When in 2005 the New York Times revealed the NSA\u2019s warrantless wiretapping, the newspaper admitted that it had sat on the story for a year at the behest of the White House. The LA Times spiked a story brought to it by a whistleblower who revealed that the telecom company AT&T had handed over all its internet traffic to the NSA. The paper had been lobbied by Hayden and the then director of national intelligence, John Negroponte. Traditional oversight did have some successes. Ron Wyden, a US senator for Oregon, managed to have Poindexter\u2019s Total Information Awareness program shut down in 2003, after an intern in his office stumbled across documents describing the operation. \u201cThat was one of our first wins \u2013\n\nquestion: Who leaked classified information about NSA surveillance operations?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Edward Snowden", "usage": 1101}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

(Three years later it was revealed that elements of the program had secretly been transferred from the Pentagon to the NSA.) Wyden, a longstanding member of the Senate select committee on intelligence, has been at the forefront of efforts to force sunlight into the world of secret surveillance. As the 10th anniversary of 9/11 was approaching he issued his famous warning on the Senate floor, telling the American people that when they found out how the government had interpreted the Patriot Act \u201cthey will be stunned and they will be angry\u201d. In another legendary moment two years later, he posed a direct question to the then director of national intelligence, James Clapper, about whether the NSA was collecting data on hundreds of millions of Americans. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d Clapper lied. Wyden told the Guardian that the exchange showed how far the government had allowed itself to slide in terms of basic American values. \u201cJames Clapper lied to the American people and he lied to the committee. It wasn\u2019t the only time they lied \u2013 they lied several times over the years, which is why I finally said I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I didn\u2019t ask the question I did in public.\u201d It is a paradox of Wyden\u2019s attempts to wrench surveillance into the open that despite his efforts the full truth about the massive dragnet of all Americans\u2019 digital communications remained concealed. As a member of the committee, the senator was briefed in secret about the warrantless eavesdropping but was constrained by what he has called the \u201ccumbersome and unwieldy\u201d restrictions on his public remarks. The Guardian asked Wyden whether he thought, with the benefit of hindsight over these past 20 years, that Congress could have done more to check the intelligence agencies. \u201cYou look back, and the answer is: sure. You keep pushing the rock up the hill and you have wins, and there are times when you wish there had been stronger support for reform.\u201d Before Edward Snowden there was Mark Klein. He was the whistleblower who exposed the AT&T story that the LA Times declined to publish. Klein was a technician assigned to the internet room of AT&T\u2019s Folsom Street building in San Francisco through which colossal quantities of data passed every hour. It was 2004 and unbeknown to the public the telecoms company had been bending over backwards since days after 9/11 to help the US government spy on its own people. As Klein went about routine maintenance, his eye was drawn to a splitter cabinet inside the room. It was dividing the light beam carrying the data into two separate signals, and passing one of them \u2013 an exact copy of the other \u2013 down to the floor below. Klein\u2019s curiosity intensified when he tried to follow the signal and found that the lower room was locked behind a door marked 641A. Nobody was allowed in without special authorization from the NSA. When Klein obtained internal engineering documents outlining the flow of data through the splitter cabinet down to the secret room, his suspicions were confirmed. The NSA was copying and collecting everybody\u2019s information carried not only by AT&T but also by 16 other internet providers who shared the pipeline. \u201cI was horrified and astonished. It was like a police state, sweeping up everybody\u2019s information blindly and allowing agents to go through it at their leisure.\u201d Klein\u2019s discovery was made public by Wired magazine in 2006. The documents he obtained went on to form the basis of a major lawsuit launched by the EFF, though in 2008 Congress passed a law absolving AT&T and other phone companies from any legal liability for collaborating with the spy chiefs. Mark Klein, Thomas Tamm, Thomas Drake, William Binney, Kirk Wiebe, Edward Loomis, Diane Roark \u2013 the list of individuals who, for a variety of motives, provided critical information to investigative journalists seeking to expose the surveillance state is long and impressive. Without them, given the failure of checks and balances, we might still be in the dark today. \u201cEverything we know about mass surveillance we know not because of our government institutions but despite them,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cWe know because of courageous sources and journalists who pried those stories out into the light.\u201d And then there was Snowden. On 6 June 2013 \u2013 almost 12 years after 9/11 \u2013 the first incendiary story exposing the NSA\u2019s dragnet of the telephone records of millions of Verizon customers was published by the Guardian. The next day the paper reported on Prism, a system for sucking up data from US internet giants including Google and Facebook. The lid on the secret US surveillance state had finally been lifted. One of the documents Snowden disclosed neatly encapsulated the NSA\u2019s posture: \u201cSniff It All, Know It All, Collect It All, Process It All, Exploit It All, Partner It All.\u201d Snowden has an even more\n\nquestion: Who leaked classified information about NSA surveillance operations?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Edward Snowden", "usage": 1081}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In his memoir Permanent Record he writes: \u201cAll of us had been reduced to something like children, who\u2019d be forced to live the rest of our lives under omniscient parental supervision.\u201d It is tempting to think of the mass surveillance put in place post-9/11 as a great leveler \u2013 after all, the NSA did grab the metadata of all Americans irrespective of race, class or religion. But to suggest that 9/11 gave birth to a new equality of snooping under the government\u2019s all-seeing eye would be a travesty. Surveillance has always fallen unevenly in the US, stretching back to the days when slaves were required to carry lanterns at night so they could be followed. After 9/11 it was the turn of Muslims. \u201cThe Patriot Act was the stepping stone for what became open season on American Muslims,\u201d said Nihad Awad, the executive director of the advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cThere were no rules. The government just said \u2018Let\u2019s go after Muslims.\u2019\u201d Before 9/11 Awad had been invited to sit on White House advisory committees. After 9/11 he and his family would routinely be stopped and searched at airports and treated like criminals. \u201cWe became the enemy,\u201d he said. For years Awad was puzzled by the hostile stories in the press containing personal details, the banks that refused to do business with him. He had to wait until Snowden to make sense of what was happening. An investigation by the Intercept based on the Snowden files showed that Awad had been placed on a top-secret list of 7,485 people, many foreigners but also including an unknown number of Americans, whose emails were being monitored by the NSA and FBI. They included other high-profile Muslim Americans including a former Republican candidate, a lawyer and university professors. \u201cWhen Snowden let us know that I was on the list I realized the government had access to my private emails and were sharing them with Congress and leaking them to the media,\u201d Awad said. \u201cI felt invaded by my own government, punished for leading a civil rights organization. If people like me in positions of influence were treated like this, what about the average Muslim?\u201d Asad Dandia was born and raised in Brooklyn. He was eight years-old on 9/11 and a teenager when his troubles started. As a religiously observant Muslim, he had founded with friends a food distribution charity offering help to struggling families from his community. In March 2012 he was contacted through Facebook by a stranger named Shamiur Rahman who said he wanted to volunteer for a spiritually grounded organization like his. Rahman said he had been through a rough patch himself and now wanted to help others. Dandia welcomed Rahman in. \u201cHe quickly grew close to me and to my circles,\u201d he said. \u201cHe met my family, he ate my mother\u2019s food, he slept over one night. We shared many intimate moments of emotional and spiritual reflection.\u201d At times Rahman behaved strangely. Whenever Dandia introduced him to anybody the first thing he would do would be to ask for their phone number. He also asked provocative questions, like what Dandia thought of the killing in Benghazi of Christopher Stevens, the US ambassador to Libya. \u201cThat was a really dumb question \u2013 it was murder and obviously we thought it was wrong,\u201d Dandia said. But he gave Rahman the benefit of the doubt. \u201cI attributed that to the fact he had mental health and drug addiction issues. I thought we should be patient with him.\u201d A few months after Rahman entered his life, Dandia was taken aside by a member of his local Muslim community who was working as an NYPD officer. \u201cYou are being watched, there\u2019s a file with your name and photos in it and you are being followed,\u201d he told Dandia. Seven months into their friendship, Rahman posted a confession on Facebook. He was an NYPD informant tasked with infiltrating Muslim groups and mosques. The news travelled fast and sent a chill throughout the area. Mosques asked Dandia to stop fundraising for his food bank as they were afraid of being targeted themselves. Dandia grew reclusive. \u201cIt made me suspicious of people. I hid my left-leaning political views and deeper religious commitments. That wasn\u2019t how I wanted to live, in a state of permanent paranoia, but there was a complete breakdown in trust.\u201d Through the Associated Press, Dandia came to learn that he was just a speck in the NYPD\u2019s mountainous surveillance of Muslims. Communities up and down the east coast were mapped through a secret \u201cDemographics Unit\u201d and individuals\u2019 daily habits \u2013 shopping, work, prayer, school \u2013 tracked on massive CIA-\n\nquestion: Who leaked classified information about NSA surveillance operations?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Edward Snowden", "usage": 1064}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Muslims with drug habits who fell into the NYPD\u2019s clutches, like Rahman, were offered lenient treatment in return for turning informant. \u201cI felt betrayed,\u201d Dandia said. \u201cI was born and raised in New York. This is the city that I love and that I\u2019m proud to call my home. It targeted me because of my religion, like a foreign enemy.\u201d Since Snowden shone his laser beam into the secret surveillance state-within-a-state, there has been a concerted effort to restore the balance, destroyed after 9/11, between individual liberties and national security. The USA Freedom Act in 2015 curtailed some of the NSA\u2019s metadata practices, passing the storage of bulk phone records from the agency to the phone companies, and opening up the foreign intelligence surveillance court to a modicum of public scrutiny. It was the first time since the 1970s that Congress had limited the NSA\u2019s authority in any way. \u201cWe have closed great swathes of the internet to the oldest methods of mass surveillance,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian. In 2019 the NSA let it be known that it had shut down its mass collection of phone and text records. The NSA cited \u201ctechnical irregularities\u201d, but by then it was widely known that the spying program had not only been illegal in its inception, it just hadn\u2019t worked. Despite the NSA\u2019s claim that by snooping on all Americans\u2019 communications it had thwarted numerous other 9/11s, the agency could only point to one terrorism case, that of Basaalay Moalin, found guilty of funding Somali extremism, that had come through the phone records program. Last year a federal judge concluded that even Moalin\u2019s case had been irrelevant: the NSA played no role in his conviction. There have been other victories in the battle against the surveillance state. Wyden was heartened by the vote in the Senate last year on his amendment to protect the browsing history of Americans from secret surveillance. The amendment failed, but by only one vote. \u201cI thought that was very telling, we almost won \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t have happened 15 years ago.\u201d Asad Dandia signed up to a class-action lawsuit challenging the NYPD\u2019s mass surveillance of him and so many other Muslim Americans. In 2016 they achieved a groundbreaking settlement that sharply reined in police targeting of religious and racial groups. \u201cI felt empowered, it gave me hope that Americans can push the country to live up to its own ideals,\u201d he said. Perhaps the biggest shift has been among the American people. The urge of individuals to protect themselves against state eavesdropping became so intense that tech giants were forced to respond and in 2016, for the first time since the internet was created, it carried more encrypted data than unencrypted. Which is not to say that the state-within-a-state has withered away, or that the balance between privacy and security has been perfected. \u201cNot even close,\u201d Cohn said. The Guardian asked surveillance experts what, in the present moment, keeps them up at night. What dastardly new tricks from the spymasters do they fear most? Wyden pointed to legal loopholes that allow shady private data brokers to sell Americans\u2019 personal information to government agencies without any court oversight. \u201cI continue to be very worried about that,\u201d he said. Snowden raised a similar shift, where mass surveillance is now predominantly performed by \u201camoral telecommunications and surveillance-masquerading-as-advertising companies. They exploit weaknesses in our laws, devices and networks to pad out their dossiers, and then sell them to governments.\u201d Cohn talked about how surveillance cameras were being weaponized with the addition of facial recognition technology that could have especially dire consequences for people of colour. Wizner said he sweated over the rise of robotic surveillance and AI. \u201cMore and more we will see critical decisions affecting liberty being made inside black boxes,\u201d he said. For Patrick Toomey of the ACLU\u2019s national security project, what keeps him up at night is simply all of it, the whole technological gamut. \u201cThe threat is persistent surveillance \u2013 of being surveilled wherever we go using a vast network of devices that can potentially listen to what we say, or recognize who we are based on our faces or the way we walk. There\u2019s a very real danger that this sensitive information will be used to make decisions that are discriminatory or inaccurate, that can profoundly impact our lives.\u201d In the last analysis, the US surveillance state got away with operating in total secret for so many years after 9/11 that it raises the question: are we still in the dark? \u201cThis will always be like trying to keep the kibble from the cat,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cSo long as they know what they want is out there somewhere, they\u2019re going\n\nquestion: Who leaked classified information about NSA surveillance operations?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Edward Snowden", "usage": 1068}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The framers of the Constitution recognized the threat a standing army posed to democracy and they sought to establish a government that guaranteed civilian supremacy over the military. This ideal was finally codified after the Civil War through the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibited the Army from engaging in law enforcement activities on U.S. soil. But Congress has weakened Posse Comitatus over the years by permitting military involvement in drug enforcement, border control and all sorts of other \u201cdomestic support\u201d operations. As a result, the military is increasingly turning its powerful intelligence collection capabilities against Americans. Total Information Awareness. Shortly after 9/11, the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began a project called \u201cTotal Information Awareness\u201d to collect and mine vast amounts of information about the American public, including their telephone records, bank records, medical records, and educational and travel data, in an attempt to identify terrorists. Congress de-funded TIA in 2003 in the wake of the public outcry denouncing such an Orwellian spying operation, but large scale information collection and data mining programs persist, and the military remains heavily involved. NSA\u2019s Warrantless Wiretapping Program. In December 2005 the New York Times revealed that soon after the September 11 attacks, former President Bush authorized the National Security Agency (NSA), an intelligence component of the Defense Department, to conduct warrantless surveillance of American\u2019s e-mails and telephone calls in blatant violation of a federal statute which prohibited the practice (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act). Subsequent articles in USA Today revealed that major telecommunications companies \u201cworking under contract to the NSA\u201d also provided the government with millions of Americans\u2019 domestic call data for \u201csocial network analysis.\u201d This warrantless surveillance program operated until January 2007. FISA Amendments Act Electronic Surveillance. In 2008 Congress passed a law called the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) which not only legalized the NSA\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program, it actually expanded the NSA\u2019s power to conduct warrantless, suspicion-less dragnet collection of American\u2019s international e-mails and telephone calls. Although very little is known about the government\u2019s implementation of its intrusive FAA spying powers, two New York Times articles (April and July 2009; LINK) revealed the NSA was collecting Americans\u2019 communications under the FAA by the millions and that it was improperly collecting purely domestic communications. National Security Letters. In 2007 an ACLU lawsuit revealed that DoD secretly issued hundreds of national security letters (NSLs) to obtain private and sensitive records of people within the United States without court approval. While the FBI has broad NSL powers and compliance with FBI-issued NSLs is mandatory, DoD\u2019s NSL power is more limited in scope, and, in most cases, compliance with DoD demands is not mandatory. A comprehensive analysis of 455 NSLs issued after 9/11 shows that the DoD seems to have collaborated with the FBI to circumvent the law to use FBI NSLs to obtain records DoD was not authorized to demand for its own investigations. TALON and The Counterintelligence Field Activity Agency (CIFA). But military spying goes far beyond the NSA and abuse of NSLs. In 2003 a highly secretive component of the DoD, the Counterintelligence Field Activity Agency (\u201cCIFA\u201d), began a program to track potential terrorist threats to Department personnel or property within the United States through Threat and Local Observation Notices (\u201cTALON\u201d). These TALON reports were designed to permit civilians and military personnel to report on suspicious activity near defense installations. Not surprisingly, the DOD soon strayed from this limited mission and TALON became a repository for information about peaceful anti-war protesters, and even Quakers. Reports were added to the database even when the \u201cthreat\u201d was an anti-war protest that occurred far from any military installation. Other \u201cthreats\u201d the military deemed non-credible were never removed from the database. CIFA was disbanded in 2008, but a new office at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) was opened to assume CIFA\u2019s \u201cresources and responsibilities.\u201d In May 2010 DoD announced it was going to participate in a new suspicious activity reporting program through the FBI\u2019s eGuardian program. Then, in June 2010 DIA published a federal register notice announcing the creation of a new data base for information on \u201cindividuals involved in, or of interest to, DoD intelligence, counterintelligence, counterterrorism and counter-narcotic operations or analytical projects as well as individuals involved in foreign intelligence and/or training activities\u201d \u2013 in short, what appears to be a de facto resurrection of the CIFA program. Political Protest Groups. DoD personnel have also been involved in illegal undercover operations targeting political protest groups.

He used a fake name and posed as a sympathizer for more than a year, all the while reporting the groups\u2019 activities to the local law enforcement agencies he worked with. While the military opened an internal investigation, a leaked 2009 Department of the Army document (\u201cConcept of Operations for Police Intelligence Operations\u201d) claims that Military Police Intelligence units are not subject to legal limitations on domestic military intelligence operations. Fusion Centers and JTTFs. The U.S. military is also involved in intelligence activities conducted through FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) and state and local intelligence fusion centers. For example, DoD is involved in a nationwide FBI investigation that targets returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans to determine if they have become right-wing extremists. DoD\u2019s role in this investigation is likely being coordinated through JTTFs. And though DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano reportedly told the New York Times \u201cthat fusion centers were not intended to have a military presence, and that she was not aware of ones that did,\u201d National Guard troops are present in many fusion centers; indeed, the ACLU documented U.S. Army presence at a Maryland fusion center in 2007. Moreover, in 2009 DHS announced it was giving state and local fusion centers access to classified military intelligence in DoD databases. An ongoing scandal involving military personnel and the Los Angeles County Terrorism Early Warning Center (LACTEW), one of the country\u2019s first fusion centers, highlights the lack of oversight in these joint intelligence operations. According to reports from the San Diego Union-Tribune, a group of military reservists and law enforcement officers led by the co-founder of the L.A. fusion center engaged in a years-long conspiracy to steal highly classified intelligence files from the Strategic Technical Operations Center located at the U.S. Marine Corps Base at Camp Pendleton, California and secret surveillance reports from the U.S. Northern Command headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Some of the stolen files reportedly \u201cpertained to surveillance of Muslim communities in Southern California,\u201d including mosques in Los Angeles and San Diego, and revealed \u201ca federal surveillance program targeting Muslim groups\u201d in the United States. The scheme apparently began in 2001 when the LACTEW fusion center\u2019s co-founder called a civilian analyst at U.S. Northern Command to ask that she surreptitiously supply the LACTEW with military surveillance reports. The reported involvement of the National Security Agency in the investigation hints that these records may relate to warrantless domestic surveillance operations conducted by the military. \u00ab Back to Suspicious Activity Reporting Programs | Go To Spy Files \u00bb Every month, you'll receive regular roundups of the most important civil rights and civil liberties developments.

It was a beautiful day under a sparkling blue sky, and as he sped down Maryland\u2019s Route 32 with the window down and radio blasting, the teenager was sure it was going to be a lucky day. Soon after 8.46am the radio cut to news that a plane had crashed into one of the Twin Towers in New York City. At 9.03am, by now at his desk, he was stunned to hear that a second plane had crashed into the other tower, followed half an hour later by similar catastrophe at the Pentagon in Washington. He leapt back into his car and screeched into reverse, only to find himself stuck in gridlocked traffic sandwiched between hundreds of other vehicles. He was stuck outside the headquarters of the National Security Agency (NSA), the US intelligence body that runs one of the largest surveillance operations in the world. The road was jammed with personnel streaming out of the NSA building following an order to evacuate. The air was thick with the sound of yelling, cellphones ringing, car engines revving vainly in the stationary traffic. The surreal spectacle of thousands of NSA intelligence agents abandoning their posts after the worst terrorist attack on the US, only to be bogged down in gridlock, made a deep impression on the teenager, Edward Snowden. As did 9/11 itself, which radically changed the course of his life. In its wake, Snowden became caught up in the surge of patriotism that swept the nation. Inspired to play his part, he joined the army, entered the intelligence community, and some 12 years after 9/11 found himself back at the same NSA where he had ground to a halt on that fateful day. The attacks on the Twin Towers and Pentagon had brought Snowden deep into the heart of America\u2019s secretive surveillance operations. But in the process it had given him access to highly classified databases that revealed to him a massive secret world, a sort of hidden state-within-the-state that had been created in the wake of 9/11. Snowden would go on to carry out the largest intelligence leak in the NSA\u2019s history. It would expose one of the great legacies of 9/11 \u2013 the rise of the ubiquitous US surveillance state. \u201cPanic made us politically vulnerable,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian as he ruminated on the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11. \u201cThat vulnerability was exploited by our own government to entitle itself to radically expanded powers that had for decades been out of reach.\u201d Snowden said that upon reflection the explosion of domestic spying post-9/11 should have been anticipated. \u201cWe should have known what was to come and, looking back at the public record, I think that on an intellectual level many of us did know. But political and media elites relentlessly repeated that the choice here was obvious: a guarantee of life or a certainty of death.\u201d That teenager on 9/11 is now an exile from his own country, charged under the Espionage Act for having revealed the US government\u2019s mass espionage on its own people. The way he sees it 20 years on, the false claim that expanding state power was necessary to avoid certain death from further terrorist atrocities has led to decades of public indifference. \u201cWith that framing, who could care whether or not the gloves came off the machinery of state? We are only now beginning to care again \u2013 to care collectively \u2013 because we sit at the bottom of a 20-year hole carved by our neglect.\u201d It happened in the blink of an eye. Within hours of the fourth plane crashing into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, George Bush\u2019s White House and intelligence chiefs had begun to lay the foundations of the mass surveillance state. The Patriot Act, which swatted away longstanding rules preventing the state from monitoring US citizens without \u201cprobable cause\u201d, was passed in a lightning-fast 45 days. The legislation became law with minimal debate or opposition in Congress, granting domestic law enforcement agencies sweeping new powers. It allowed the government to track the online behavior of Americans while making it much easier to acquire a warrant. It gave the green light for the FBI and CIA to carry out \u201croving wiretaps\u201d where agents could follow communications trails between phones and computers. It eviscerated the firewall that had been in place since the 1970s shielding US citizens from foreign surveillance. And it greatly boosted the power of the FBI to obtain personal customer records of Americans from phone companies, banks and internet providers without court approval through so-called National Security Letters. If the Patriot Act was produced in a flash, behind the scenes secret systems for mass surveillance were being built at even greater speed.

The plan, ominously titled \u201cTotal information awareness\u201d, was the brainchild of John Poindexter, a disgraced former naval officer who had been Ronald Reagan\u2019s national security adviser and a key figure in the Iran-contra scandal. TIA, Poindexter blustered, would act as an early-warning alarm for future 9/11s by gathering up the digital data of all Americans \u2013 innocent or guilty \u2013 and using it to search for patterns of terrorist activity. No warrants would be sought. They would just do it, irrespective of laws or constitutional niceties. \u201cWe must put introduction of new technology on a wartime basis,\u201d Poindexter said. Weeks later he managed to sell the idea to the Pentagon in return for a $200m budget. The NSA wasn\u2019t far behind. The agency was busy devising Stellar Wind, its warrantless surveillance system. It sought to identify terrorist links by analysing the metadata drawn from the emails, telephone calls and internet activity of huge numbers of Americans. The Snowden documents showed that by 14 September \u2013 just three days after the attacks \u2013 the then director of the NSA, Michael Hayden, had taken a \u201ctactical decision\u201d to begin snooping on the digital communications of people based in the US. From now on, the NSA granted itself the power to surveil any American on US soil who was in digital contact with a foreign country where terrorism was known to exist \u2013 no warrant needed. This was a seismic shift. It meant that the nation\u2019s most powerful eavesdropping agency had ascribed to itself, without consulting Congress or the courts, the ability to listen in to the communications of Americans in a way that violated constitutional rights and laws. On 4 October 2001 the White House granted permission, again in secret and without consultation, for the NSA to turn its spotlight on to US citizens in what became known as the President\u2019s Surveillance Program. \u201cThey essentially claimed wartime authority to engage in domestic surveillance that is criminal under statutory law,\u201d said Ben Wizner, Snowden\u2019s lawyer, who works on surveillance at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). How could the spymasters have moved to put in place complex systems of mass surveillance just hours and days after 9/11? There is only one answer, many observers believe. \u201cThey had it all ready,\u201d said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which defends civil liberties in the digital space. \u201cThis is what the NSA had long wanted \u2013 to \u2018sit on the wire\u2019, to watch all internet traffic and pick out whatever they chose. Now they finally had the crisis they needed to make it happen.\u201d By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, an entire nation within the nation had arisen dedicated to keeping the American people nominally safe by placing everybody under observation. The Washington Post called it a \u201cTop Secret America hidden from public view\u201d. The sprawling surveillance infrastructure had proliferated to the extent that nobody \u2013 not even top intelligence officials \u2013 knew how much it cost or how many it employed. The Post\u2019s best estimate in July 2010 was that it spanned 10,000 locations across the US. The scale of growth can be glimpsed by looking at some of the public elements. The number of National Security Letters granted each year increased more than fourfold between 2000 and 2003, peaking at almost 60,000 the following year. By 2008 almost 20,000 people were being targeted under its remit. The intelligence budget grew from a little over $40bn a year in the late 1990s to almost $100bn by 2010, remaining $80bn to this day. When Wizner looks back on the past 20 years he is struck not just by this explosion in surveillance but also by the failure of governance that enabled it. Key institutions like the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court, which is supposed to provide legal oversight, genuflected in front of the NSA. \u201cThis is a story about checks and balances failing,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cThe courts deferred to the expertise and secrecy claims of the executive, Congress failed to hold the intelligence agencies accountable.\u201d Even the media fell short of holding power to account. When in 2005 the New York Times revealed the NSA\u2019s warrantless wiretapping, the newspaper admitted that it had sat on the story for a year at the behest of the White House. The LA Times spiked a story brought to it by a whistleblower who revealed that the telecom company AT&T had handed over all its internet traffic to the NSA. The paper had been lobbied by Hayden and the then director of national intelligence, John Negroponte. Traditional oversight did have some successes. Ron Wyden, a US senator for Oregon, managed to have Poindexter\u2019s Total Information Awareness program shut down in 2003, after an intern in his office stumbled across documents describing the operation. \u201cThat was one of our first wins \u2013\n\nquestion: What do the articles highlight the need for?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The articles highlight the need for checks and balances and proper governance.", "usage": 1112}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

(Three years later it was revealed that elements of the program had secretly been transferred from the Pentagon to the NSA.) Wyden, a longstanding member of the Senate select committee on intelligence, has been at the forefront of efforts to force sunlight into the world of secret surveillance. As the 10th anniversary of 9/11 was approaching he issued his famous warning on the Senate floor, telling the American people that when they found out how the government had interpreted the Patriot Act \u201cthey will be stunned and they will be angry\u201d. In another legendary moment two years later, he posed a direct question to the then director of national intelligence, James Clapper, about whether the NSA was collecting data on hundreds of millions of Americans. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d Clapper lied. Wyden told the Guardian that the exchange showed how far the government had allowed itself to slide in terms of basic American values. \u201cJames Clapper lied to the American people and he lied to the committee. It wasn\u2019t the only time they lied \u2013 they lied several times over the years, which is why I finally said I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I didn\u2019t ask the question I did in public.\u201d It is a paradox of Wyden\u2019s attempts to wrench surveillance into the open that despite his efforts the full truth about the massive dragnet of all Americans\u2019 digital communications remained concealed. As a member of the committee, the senator was briefed in secret about the warrantless eavesdropping but was constrained by what he has called the \u201ccumbersome and unwieldy\u201d restrictions on his public remarks. The Guardian asked Wyden whether he thought, with the benefit of hindsight over these past 20 years, that Congress could have done more to check the intelligence agencies. \u201cYou look back, and the answer is: sure. You keep pushing the rock up the hill and you have wins, and there are times when you wish there had been stronger support for reform.\u201d Before Edward Snowden there was Mark Klein. He was the whistleblower who exposed the AT&T story that the LA Times declined to publish. Klein was a technician assigned to the internet room of AT&T\u2019s Folsom Street building in San Francisco through which colossal quantities of data passed every hour. It was 2004 and unbeknown to the public the telecoms company had been bending over backwards since days after 9/11 to help the US government spy on its own people. As Klein went about routine maintenance, his eye was drawn to a splitter cabinet inside the room. It was dividing the light beam carrying the data into two separate signals, and passing one of them \u2013 an exact copy of the other \u2013 down to the floor below. Klein\u2019s curiosity intensified when he tried to follow the signal and found that the lower room was locked behind a door marked 641A. Nobody was allowed in without special authorization from the NSA. When Klein obtained internal engineering documents outlining the flow of data through the splitter cabinet down to the secret room, his suspicions were confirmed. The NSA was copying and collecting everybody\u2019s information carried not only by AT&T but also by 16 other internet providers who shared the pipeline. \u201cI was horrified and astonished. It was like a police state, sweeping up everybody\u2019s information blindly and allowing agents to go through it at their leisure.\u201d Klein\u2019s discovery was made public by Wired magazine in 2006. The documents he obtained went on to form the basis of a major lawsuit launched by the EFF, though in 2008 Congress passed a law absolving AT&T and other phone companies from any legal liability for collaborating with the spy chiefs. Mark Klein, Thomas Tamm, Thomas Drake, William Binney, Kirk Wiebe, Edward Loomis, Diane Roark \u2013 the list of individuals who, for a variety of motives, provided critical information to investigative journalists seeking to expose the surveillance state is long and impressive. Without them, given the failure of checks and balances, we might still be in the dark today. \u201cEverything we know about mass surveillance we know not because of our government institutions but despite them,\u201d Wizner said. \u201cWe know because of courageous sources and journalists who pried those stories out into the light.\u201d And then there was Snowden. On 6 June 2013 \u2013 almost 12 years after 9/11 \u2013 the first incendiary story exposing the NSA\u2019s dragnet of the telephone records of millions of Verizon customers was published by the Guardian. The next day the paper reported on Prism, a system for sucking up data from US internet giants including Google and Facebook. The lid on the secret US surveillance state had finally been lifted. One of the documents Snowden disclosed neatly encapsulated the NSA\u2019s posture: \u201cSniff It All, Know It All, Collect It All, Process It All, Exploit It All, Partner It All.\u201d Snowden has an even more\n\nquestion: What do the articles highlight the need for?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "reform of the intelligence agencies", "usage": 1085}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In his memoir Permanent Record he writes: \u201cAll of us had been reduced to something like children, who\u2019d be forced to live the rest of our lives under omniscient parental supervision.\u201d It is tempting to think of the mass surveillance put in place post-9/11 as a great leveler \u2013 after all, the NSA did grab the metadata of all Americans irrespective of race, class or religion. But to suggest that 9/11 gave birth to a new equality of snooping under the government\u2019s all-seeing eye would be a travesty. Surveillance has always fallen unevenly in the US, stretching back to the days when slaves were required to carry lanterns at night so they could be followed. After 9/11 it was the turn of Muslims. \u201cThe Patriot Act was the stepping stone for what became open season on American Muslims,\u201d said Nihad Awad, the executive director of the advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cThere were no rules. The government just said \u2018Let\u2019s go after Muslims.\u2019\u201d Before 9/11 Awad had been invited to sit on White House advisory committees. After 9/11 he and his family would routinely be stopped and searched at airports and treated like criminals. \u201cWe became the enemy,\u201d he said. For years Awad was puzzled by the hostile stories in the press containing personal details, the banks that refused to do business with him. He had to wait until Snowden to make sense of what was happening. An investigation by the Intercept based on the Snowden files showed that Awad had been placed on a top-secret list of 7,485 people, many foreigners but also including an unknown number of Americans, whose emails were being monitored by the NSA and FBI. They included other high-profile Muslim Americans including a former Republican candidate, a lawyer and university professors. \u201cWhen Snowden let us know that I was on the list I realized the government had access to my private emails and were sharing them with Congress and leaking them to the media,\u201d Awad said. \u201cI felt invaded by my own government, punished for leading a civil rights organization. If people like me in positions of influence were treated like this, what about the average Muslim?\u201d Asad Dandia was born and raised in Brooklyn. He was eight years-old on 9/11 and a teenager when his troubles started. As a religiously observant Muslim, he had founded with friends a food distribution charity offering help to struggling families from his community. In March 2012 he was contacted through Facebook by a stranger named Shamiur Rahman who said he wanted to volunteer for a spiritually grounded organization like his. Rahman said he had been through a rough patch himself and now wanted to help others. Dandia welcomed Rahman in. \u201cHe quickly grew close to me and to my circles,\u201d he said. \u201cHe met my family, he ate my mother\u2019s food, he slept over one night. We shared many intimate moments of emotional and spiritual reflection.\u201d At times Rahman behaved strangely. Whenever Dandia introduced him to anybody the first thing he would do would be to ask for their phone number. He also asked provocative questions, like what Dandia thought of the killing in Benghazi of Christopher Stevens, the US ambassador to Libya. \u201cThat was a really dumb question \u2013 it was murder and obviously we thought it was wrong,\u201d Dandia said. But he gave Rahman the benefit of the doubt. \u201cI attributed that to the fact he had mental health and drug addiction issues. I thought we should be patient with him.\u201d A few months after Rahman entered his life, Dandia was taken aside by a member of his local Muslim community who was working as an NYPD officer. \u201cYou are being watched, there\u2019s a file with your name and photos in it and you are being followed,\u201d he told Dandia. Seven months into their friendship, Rahman posted a confession on Facebook. He was an NYPD informant tasked with infiltrating Muslim groups and mosques. The news travelled fast and sent a chill throughout the area. Mosques asked Dandia to stop fundraising for his food bank as they were afraid of being targeted themselves. Dandia grew reclusive. \u201cIt made me suspicious of people. I hid my left-leaning political views and deeper religious commitments. That wasn\u2019t how I wanted to live, in a state of permanent paranoia, but there was a complete breakdown in trust.\u201d Through the Associated Press, Dandia came to learn that he was just a speck in the NYPD\u2019s mountainous surveillance of Muslims. Communities up and down the east coast were mapped through a secret \u201cDemographics Unit\u201d and individuals\u2019 daily habits \u2013 shopping, work, prayer, school \u2013 tracked on massive CIA-\n\nquestion: What do the articles highlight the need for?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The articles highlight the need for increased oversight of surveillance operations.", "usage": 1074}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Muslims with drug habits who fell into the NYPD\u2019s clutches, like Rahman, were offered lenient treatment in return for turning informant. \u201cI felt betrayed,\u201d Dandia said. \u201cI was born and raised in New York. This is the city that I love and that I\u2019m proud to call my home. It targeted me because of my religion, like a foreign enemy.\u201d Since Snowden shone his laser beam into the secret surveillance state-within-a-state, there has been a concerted effort to restore the balance, destroyed after 9/11, between individual liberties and national security. The USA Freedom Act in 2015 curtailed some of the NSA\u2019s metadata practices, passing the storage of bulk phone records from the agency to the phone companies, and opening up the foreign intelligence surveillance court to a modicum of public scrutiny. It was the first time since the 1970s that Congress had limited the NSA\u2019s authority in any way. \u201cWe have closed great swathes of the internet to the oldest methods of mass surveillance,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian. In 2019 the NSA let it be known that it had shut down its mass collection of phone and text records. The NSA cited \u201ctechnical irregularities\u201d, but by then it was widely known that the spying program had not only been illegal in its inception, it just hadn\u2019t worked. Despite the NSA\u2019s claim that by snooping on all Americans\u2019 communications it had thwarted numerous other 9/11s, the agency could only point to one terrorism case, that of Basaalay Moalin, found guilty of funding Somali extremism, that had come through the phone records program. Last year a federal judge concluded that even Moalin\u2019s case had been irrelevant: the NSA played no role in his conviction. There have been other victories in the battle against the surveillance state. Wyden was heartened by the vote in the Senate last year on his amendment to protect the browsing history of Americans from secret surveillance. The amendment failed, but by only one vote. \u201cI thought that was very telling, we almost won \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t have happened 15 years ago.\u201d Asad Dandia signed up to a class-action lawsuit challenging the NYPD\u2019s mass surveillance of him and so many other Muslim Americans. In 2016 they achieved a groundbreaking settlement that sharply reined in police targeting of religious and racial groups. \u201cI felt empowered, it gave me hope that Americans can push the country to live up to its own ideals,\u201d he said. Perhaps the biggest shift has been among the American people. The urge of individuals to protect themselves against state eavesdropping became so intense that tech giants were forced to respond and in 2016, for the first time since the internet was created, it carried more encrypted data than unencrypted. Which is not to say that the state-within-a-state has withered away, or that the balance between privacy and security has been perfected. \u201cNot even close,\u201d Cohn said. The Guardian asked surveillance experts what, in the present moment, keeps them up at night. What dastardly new tricks from the spymasters do they fear most? Wyden pointed to legal loopholes that allow shady private data brokers to sell Americans\u2019 personal information to government agencies without any court oversight. \u201cI continue to be very worried about that,\u201d he said. Snowden raised a similar shift, where mass surveillance is now predominantly performed by \u201camoral telecommunications and surveillance-masquerading-as-advertising companies. They exploit weaknesses in our laws, devices and networks to pad out their dossiers, and then sell them to governments.\u201d Cohn talked about how surveillance cameras were being weaponized with the addition of facial recognition technology that could have especially dire consequences for people of colour. Wizner said he sweated over the rise of robotic surveillance and AI. \u201cMore and more we will see critical decisions affecting liberty being made inside black boxes,\u201d he said. For Patrick Toomey of the ACLU\u2019s national security project, what keeps him up at night is simply all of it, the whole technological gamut. \u201cThe threat is persistent surveillance \u2013 of being surveilled wherever we go using a vast network of devices that can potentially listen to what we say, or recognize who we are based on our faces or the way we walk. There\u2019s a very real danger that this sensitive information will be used to make decisions that are discriminatory or inaccurate, that can profoundly impact our lives.\u201d In the last analysis, the US surveillance state got away with operating in total secret for so many years after 9/11 that it raises the question: are we still in the dark? \u201cThis will always be like trying to keep the kibble from the cat,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cSo long as they know what they want is out there somewhere, they\u2019re going\n\nquestion: What do the articles highlight the need for?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The articles highlight the need for a balance between individual liberties and national security.", "usage": 1081}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The framers of the Constitution recognized the threat a standing army posed to democracy and they sought to establish a government that guaranteed civilian supremacy over the military. This ideal was finally codified after the Civil War through the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibited the Army from engaging in law enforcement activities on U.S. soil. But Congress has weakened Posse Comitatus over the years by permitting military involvement in drug enforcement, border control and all sorts of other \u201cdomestic support\u201d operations. As a result, the military is increasingly turning its powerful intelligence collection capabilities against Americans. Total Information Awareness. Shortly after 9/11, the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began a project called \u201cTotal Information Awareness\u201d to collect and mine vast amounts of information about the American public, including their telephone records, bank records, medical records, and educational and travel data, in an attempt to identify terrorists. Congress de-funded TIA in 2003 in the wake of the public outcry denouncing such an Orwellian spying operation, but large scale information collection and data mining programs persist, and the military remains heavily involved. NSA\u2019s Warrantless Wiretapping Program. In December 2005 the New York Times revealed that soon after the September 11 attacks, former President Bush authorized the National Security Agency (NSA), an intelligence component of the Defense Department, to conduct warrantless surveillance of American\u2019s e-mails and telephone calls in blatant violation of a federal statute which prohibited the practice (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act). Subsequent articles in USA Today revealed that major telecommunications companies \u201cworking under contract to the NSA\u201d also provided the government with millions of Americans\u2019 domestic call data for \u201csocial network analysis.\u201d This warrantless surveillance program operated until January 2007. FISA Amendments Act Electronic Surveillance. In 2008 Congress passed a law called the FISA Amendments Act (FAA) which not only legalized the NSA\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program, it actually expanded the NSA\u2019s power to conduct warrantless, suspicion-less dragnet collection of American\u2019s international e-mails and telephone calls. Although very little is known about the government\u2019s implementation of its intrusive FAA spying powers, two New York Times articles (April and July 2009; LINK) revealed the NSA was collecting Americans\u2019 communications under the FAA by the millions and that it was improperly collecting purely domestic communications. National Security Letters. In 2007 an ACLU lawsuit revealed that DoD secretly issued hundreds of national security letters (NSLs) to obtain private and sensitive records of people within the United States without court approval. While the FBI has broad NSL powers and compliance with FBI-issued NSLs is mandatory, DoD\u2019s NSL power is more limited in scope, and, in most cases, compliance with DoD demands is not mandatory. A comprehensive analysis of 455 NSLs issued after 9/11 shows that the DoD seems to have collaborated with the FBI to circumvent the law to use FBI NSLs to obtain records DoD was not authorized to demand for its own investigations. TALON and The Counterintelligence Field Activity Agency (CIFA). But military spying goes far beyond the NSA and abuse of NSLs. In 2003 a highly secretive component of the DoD, the Counterintelligence Field Activity Agency (\u201cCIFA\u201d), began a program to track potential terrorist threats to Department personnel or property within the United States through Threat and Local Observation Notices (\u201cTALON\u201d). These TALON reports were designed to permit civilians and military personnel to report on suspicious activity near defense installations. Not surprisingly, the DOD soon strayed from this limited mission and TALON became a repository for information about peaceful anti-war protesters, and even Quakers. Reports were added to the database even when the \u201cthreat\u201d was an anti-war protest that occurred far from any military installation. Other \u201cthreats\u201d the military deemed non-credible were never removed from the database. CIFA was disbanded in 2008, but a new office at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) was opened to assume CIFA\u2019s \u201cresources and responsibilities.\u201d In May 2010 DoD announced it was going to participate in a new suspicious activity reporting program through the FBI\u2019s eGuardian program. Then, in June 2010 DIA published a federal register notice announcing the creation of a new data base for information on \u201cindividuals involved in, or of interest to, DoD intelligence, counterintelligence, counterterrorism and counter-narcotic operations or analytical projects as well as individuals involved in foreign intelligence and/or training activities\u201d \u2013 in short, what appears to be a de facto resurrection of the CIFA program.

He used a fake name and posed as a sympathizer for more than a year, all the while reporting the groups\u2019 activities to the local law enforcement agencies he worked with. While the military opened an internal investigation, a leaked 2009 Department of the Army document (\u201cConcept of Operations for Police Intelligence Operations\u201d) claims that Military Police Intelligence units are not subject to legal limitations on domestic military intelligence operations. Fusion Centers and JTTFs. The U.S. military is also involved in intelligence activities conducted through FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) and state and local intelligence fusion centers. For example, DoD is involved in a nationwide FBI investigation that targets returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans to determine if they have become right-wing extremists. DoD\u2019s role in this investigation is likely being coordinated through JTTFs. And though DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano reportedly told the New York Times \u201cthat fusion centers were not intended to have a military presence, and that she was not aware of ones that did,\u201d National Guard troops are present in many fusion centers; indeed, the ACLU documented U.S. Army presence at a Maryland fusion center in 2007. Moreover, in 2009 DHS announced it was giving state and local fusion centers access to classified military intelligence in DoD databases. An ongoing scandal involving military personnel and the Los Angeles County Terrorism Early Warning Center (LACTEW), one of the country\u2019s first fusion centers, highlights the lack of oversight in these joint intelligence operations. According to reports from the San Diego Union-Tribune, a group of military reservists and law enforcement officers led by the co-founder of the L.A. fusion center engaged in a years-long conspiracy to steal highly classified intelligence files from the Strategic Technical Operations Center located at the U.S. Marine Corps Base at Camp Pendleton, California and secret surveillance reports from the U.S. Northern Command headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Some of the stolen files reportedly \u201cpertained to surveillance of Muslim communities in Southern California,\u201d including mosques in Los Angeles and San Diego, and revealed \u201ca federal surveillance program targeting Muslim groups\u201d in the United States. The scheme apparently began in 2001 when the LACTEW fusion center\u2019s co-founder called a civilian analyst at U.S. Northern Command to ask that she surreptitiously supply the LACTEW with military surveillance reports. The reported involvement of the National Security Agency in the investigation hints that these records may relate to warrantless domestic surveillance operations conducted by the military. \u00ab Back to Suspicious Activity Reporting Programs | Go To Spy Files \u00bb Every month, you'll receive regular roundups of the most important civil rights and civil liberties developments.
