Archaeologists have made a groundbreaking and unlikely discovery in the Great Plains of Kansas: a sprawling, centuries-old lost city. A few years ago, Donald Blakeslee, an anthropologist and archaeology professor at Wichita State University, discovered the lost city of Etzanoa, located in present-day Arkansas City, Kan. Locals in this small town in south-central Kansas had been finding arrowheads, pottery, and other ancient artifacts in the area\u2019s fields and rivers for decades, but no one ever knew the full extent of the archaeological gold mine hidden underneath their town. According to the Los Angeles Times, Blakeslee used newly translated documents written by the Spanish conquistadors who came across the land over 400 years ago to determine that these artifacts were once part of the Native American lost city of Etzanoa. \u201c\u2018I thought, \u2018Wow, their eyewitness descriptions are so clear it\u2019s like you were there,'\u201d Blakeslee told the Times about reading the conquistador\u2019s accounts. \u201cI wanted to see if the archaeology fit their descriptions. Every single detail matched this place.\u201d The city of Etzanoa is believed to have been around from 1450 to 1700 and was home to approximately 20,000 people. Blakeslee said that the city was the second-largest settlement in the present-day United States at the time and spanned across at least five miles of the space between the Walnut and Arkansas rivers. The 20,000 inhabitants of Etzanoa were said to have lived in \u201cthatched, beehive-shaped houses.\u201d In 1541, conquistador Francisco Vazquez de Coronado came to the town hoping to discover its fabled gold but instead found Native Americans in a collection of settlements that he called Quivira. Sixty years later in 1601, Juan de O\u00f1ate led a team of 70 conquistadors from New Mexico to Quivira, also hoping to find its gold but they ran into a tribe called the Escanxaques, who told them of the nearby city of Etzanoa. O\u00f1ate and his team arrived at the city and were greeted peacefully by the inhabitants of Etzanoa. However, things quickly went south when the conquistadors started taking hostages, which then caused the city\u2019s residents to flee in fear. The group of conquistadors explored the vast area of more than 2,000 houses but feared an attack from the peoples they dislodged and decided to return home. On their return trip, they were attacked by some 1,000 members of the Escanxaque tribe and a huge battle took place. The conquistadors lost and returned home to New Mexico, never to come back to the area again. French explorers came nearly a century later to that part of south-central Kansas but did not find any evidence of Etzanoa or its people. It is believed that disease caused the untimely demise of the population. However, traces of the people and their city would not stay hidden forever. Blakeslee and a team of excavators found the site of the ancient battle in a neighborhood in Arkansas City and found remanents from the battle. Locals in the area had been uncovering artifacts from the lost city for decades but didn\u2019t understand why until evidence of the city itself was discovered by Blakeslee. \u201cLots of artifacts have been taken from here,\u201d Warren \u201cHap\u201d McLeod, a resident of Arkansas City who lives on the spot where the battle took place, told the Times. \u201cNow we know why. There were 20,000 people living here for over 200 years.\u201d David Kelly/The Los Angeles TimesRussell Bishop, a former Arkansas City resident, shows off the arrowheads he found in the area as a kid. One local resident said that the sheer amount of artifacts that people in the area have is mindblowing. \u201cMy boss had an entire basement full of pottery and all kinds of artifacts,\u201d Russell Bishop told the Times. \u201cWe\u2019d be out there working and he would recognize a black spot on the ground as an ancient campfire site \u2026 I don\u2019t think anyone knew how big this all was. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re finally getting to the bottom of it.\u201d The Great Plains were long-regarded as huge, empty spaces in ancient times that were populated mainly by nomadic tribes. But Blakeslee\u2019s discovery of Etzanoa could prove that some of the tribes in the area weren\u2019t nomadic and were actually more urban than previously believed.

By Caelin Bragg The Great Plains has often been overlooked in the history books of North America, but recent discoveries made by a team of Wichita State University archaeologists are rewriting the history of where the beating heart of North American actually was in the pre-historic era before the arrival of Christopher Columbus. According to research findings by Dr. Don Blakeslee, professor of anthropology and archaeologist at Wichita State, it turns out that the Great Plains was much bigger and much more politically and economically influential in North America than previously thought. In 2018, Blakeslee discovered the forgotten town of Etzanoa outside of Arkansas City, Kansas. But what he didn\u2019t know until now is the true extent of what lies underground: An entire nation of ancestors of today\u2019s Wichita tribe towns \u2014 called Quivira \u2014 totaling more than 200,000 people, who traded goods all across North America and who even had a previously unknown common language. While some early Spanish documents mention Quivira, the region\u2019s significance was until now unknown to the modern understanding of pre-historic North America before Columbus. \u201cIt\u2019s going to revolutionize our view of the Great Plains societies, and it already has for me and my students,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cCharles Mann wrote (in the book) \u20181491\u2019 about the thriving Native American societies before the time of Columbus in South America, Central America and the American Southeast, but when he talked about the Great Plains, he called them distant and sparsely populated and occupied by hunters and gatherers. No. In its day, Quivira was probably the most important native political unit in what\u2019s now the United States.\u201d The people who created Quivira arrived in Kansas in the late 1300s, and Quivira was fully formed around 1450. The archaeological evidence shows that they grew crops but also hunted bison in huge numbers. Over 80% of the chipped-stone artifacts from the town of Etzanoa are specialized for processing bison products, and documentary evidence shows that these products were exported from coast to coast. This discovery shattered the previous understanding of who the people of the Great Plains were \u2014 from hunters and gatherers to a continent-spanning unit. Quivira is barely mentioned in history books because it was as remote as one could get from the early European colonies. Only three Spanish expeditions visited it between 1541 and 1601, and only two of them left documentary records. By the time of the first French visit in 1719, the nation was already in a steep decline. Its collapse started around 1610, when the Spanish founded Santa Fe and initiated a slave trade based on captives from the plains. The French in Canada and the English in Virginia and South Carolina soon joined them in supplying arms to their native allies in exchange for war prisoners. As a result, raiders from the west had horses and steel-topped weapons, while those from the east were armed with guns. The raids and diseases that Europeans brought to the continent destroyed Quivira around 1700. Blakeslee\u2019s findings \u2014 which he will present at the annual Society for American Archaeology meeting March 30-April 2 \u2014 focus on three types of evidence discovered about Etzanoa and Quivira: the documentary evidence, the linguistic evidence and the archaeological evidence. Blakeslee estimates the population of Quivira to have been roughly 200,000, a number that recontextualizes the scale of who occupied the Great Plains. This number is extrapolated from the eyewitness accounts of Etzanoa having a population of 17,000 to over 20,000 people and the presence of 10 or more large towns elsewhere in Quivira. The town of Etzanoa was originally listed as 22 separate sites until Blakeslee matched the eyewitness accounts to both the archaeological record and to the modern-day landscape. The other large towns discovered are still recorded as clusters of villages rather than large towns. When recorded more accurately as a connected society of large towns rather than unrelated villages, Blakeslee says, it\u2019s clear that Quivira was much more organized and far-reaching than anyone had previously thought. The Quiviran people also had hereditary chiefs, priests, interpreters and ambassadors they would send to neighboring nations. \u201cThey were an organized society, one far different from the Hollywood version,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cBut they have not been given any recognition at all in American history books.\u201d Evidence in documents from the earliest expeditions to the southwest of the continent shows that some people in Quivira could speak Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec empire.

It is the first clear documentation of a pre-historic native Lingua Franca in North America. Cabeza de Vaca, who was shipwrecked on Galveston Island and later walked to Mexico, was the first European to mention the Lingua Franca. In one passage, he mentioned people who used it would say \u201cxo\u201d (pronounced \u201cshow\u201d) to call a dog, and \u201carraca\u201d to get the attention of a person. Blakeslee, through a chance encounter during a Day of the Dead celebration in his neighborhood, met an individual from Guadalajara who confirmed the words to be Nahuatl, and even corrected the meaning of \u201carraca\u201d to mean \u201cwelcome\u201d instead. \u201cHere was the clincher,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cTwo words that are still in use that fit the context.\u201d The land area of Quivira was at least as large as the Republic of Ireland, with the currently documented borders being from the Kansas River in the north; the town of Larned, Kansas in the west; east into Missouri; and south into Oklahoma. Documents from the DeSoto expedition of 1539-1542 indicate large quantities of Quiviran bison products as far east as Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, including meat, robes and war gear such as rawhide shields, helmets and body armor that filled a room in a town in South Carolina. At the same time, other expeditions documented bison rawhide shields in use on the west coast of Mexico and along the Colorado River between Arizona and California. Tobacco pipes made by Quivirans have been found in sites created by the Apache, Pawnee, Missouria and Caddo tribes and in the pueblos of Pecos and Taos. The people of Quivira received various items in return. So far, Blakeslee has documented pottery in Quiviran sites that came from North Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas. These archaeological sites have yielded the northernmost example of a type of pottery made in the vicinity of El Paso, and the southernmost example of a type made in central North Dakota. The items that traveled the farthest are pieces of obsidian from central Mexico and Jalisco, far down the west coast. So far, Quiviran sites have yielded more of the central Mexican obsidian than all of the rest of the archaeological sites in the United States. Wichita State students working on this research with Blakeslee are receiving a hands-on learning experience they\u2019ll likely never forget. Kait Carter is a WSU graduate student majoring in anthropology who has found a passion in uncovering and illuminating the history of the site. \u201cThere\u2019s so much knowledge out there that could be acquired, and just reconstructing history is extremely interesting,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI wish a lot more people were in the field to try and help.\u201d Brogan Gillmore, a graduate student majoring in anthropology with a focus on public archaeology, is equally as excited to share the discoveries being made in the Great Plains. \u201cThe work we are doing here at WSU is really phenomenal,\u201d Gillmore said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of amazing stuff.

Archaeologists have made a groundbreaking and unlikely discovery in the Great Plains of Kansas: a sprawling, centuries-old lost city. A few years ago, Donald Blakeslee, an anthropologist and archaeology professor at Wichita State University, discovered the lost city of Etzanoa, located in present-day Arkansas City, Kan. Locals in this small town in south-central Kansas had been finding arrowheads, pottery, and other ancient artifacts in the area\u2019s fields and rivers for decades, but no one ever knew the full extent of the archaeological gold mine hidden underneath their town. According to the Los Angeles Times, Blakeslee used newly translated documents written by the Spanish conquistadors who came across the land over 400 years ago to determine that these artifacts were once part of the Native American lost city of Etzanoa. \u201c\u2018I thought, \u2018Wow, their eyewitness descriptions are so clear it\u2019s like you were there,'\u201d Blakeslee told the Times about reading the conquistador\u2019s accounts. \u201cI wanted to see if the archaeology fit their descriptions. Every single detail matched this place.\u201d The city of Etzanoa is believed to have been around from 1450 to 1700 and was home to approximately 20,000 people. Blakeslee said that the city was the second-largest settlement in the present-day United States at the time and spanned across at least five miles of the space between the Walnut and Arkansas rivers. The 20,000 inhabitants of Etzanoa were said to have lived in \u201cthatched, beehive-shaped houses.\u201d In 1541, conquistador Francisco Vazquez de Coronado came to the town hoping to discover its fabled gold but instead found Native Americans in a collection of settlements that he called Quivira. Sixty years later in 1601, Juan de O\u00f1ate led a team of 70 conquistadors from New Mexico to Quivira, also hoping to find its gold but they ran into a tribe called the Escanxaques, who told them of the nearby city of Etzanoa. O\u00f1ate and his team arrived at the city and were greeted peacefully by the inhabitants of Etzanoa. However, things quickly went south when the conquistadors started taking hostages, which then caused the city\u2019s residents to flee in fear. The group of conquistadors explored the vast area of more than 2,000 houses but feared an attack from the peoples they dislodged and decided to return home. On their return trip, they were attacked by some 1,000 members of the Escanxaque tribe and a huge battle took place. The conquistadors lost and returned home to New Mexico, never to come back to the area again. French explorers came nearly a century later to that part of south-central Kansas but did not find any evidence of Etzanoa or its people. It is believed that disease caused the untimely demise of the population. However, traces of the people and their city would not stay hidden forever. Blakeslee and a team of excavators found the site of the ancient battle in a neighborhood in Arkansas City and found remanents from the battle. Locals in the area had been uncovering artifacts from the lost city for decades but didn\u2019t understand why until evidence of the city itself was discovered by Blakeslee. \u201cLots of artifacts have been taken from here,\u201d Warren \u201cHap\u201d McLeod, a resident of Arkansas City who lives on the spot where the battle took place, told the Times. \u201cNow we know why. There were 20,000 people living here for over 200 years.\u201d David Kelly/The Los Angeles TimesRussell Bishop, a former Arkansas City resident, shows off the arrowheads he found in the area as a kid. One local resident said that the sheer amount of artifacts that people in the area have is mindblowing. \u201cMy boss had an entire basement full of pottery and all kinds of artifacts,\u201d Russell Bishop told the Times. \u201cWe\u2019d be out there working and he would recognize a black spot on the ground as an ancient campfire site \u2026 I don\u2019t think anyone knew how big this all was. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re finally getting to the bottom of it.\u201d The Great Plains were long-regarded as huge, empty spaces in ancient times that were populated mainly by nomadic tribes. But Blakeslee\u2019s discovery of Etzanoa could prove that some of the tribes in the area weren\u2019t nomadic and were actually more urban than previously believed.

By Caelin Bragg The Great Plains has often been overlooked in the history books of North America, but recent discoveries made by a team of Wichita State University archaeologists are rewriting the history of where the beating heart of North American actually was in the pre-historic era before the arrival of Christopher Columbus. According to research findings by Dr. Don Blakeslee, professor of anthropology and archaeologist at Wichita State, it turns out that the Great Plains was much bigger and much more politically and economically influential in North America than previously thought. In 2018, Blakeslee discovered the forgotten town of Etzanoa outside of Arkansas City, Kansas. But what he didn\u2019t know until now is the true extent of what lies underground: An entire nation of ancestors of today\u2019s Wichita tribe towns \u2014 called Quivira \u2014 totaling more than 200,000 people, who traded goods all across North America and who even had a previously unknown common language. While some early Spanish documents mention Quivira, the region\u2019s significance was until now unknown to the modern understanding of pre-historic North America before Columbus. \u201cIt\u2019s going to revolutionize our view of the Great Plains societies, and it already has for me and my students,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cCharles Mann wrote (in the book) \u20181491\u2019 about the thriving Native American societies before the time of Columbus in South America, Central America and the American Southeast, but when he talked about the Great Plains, he called them distant and sparsely populated and occupied by hunters and gatherers.

Archaeology news hit an absolute goldmine in a relatively unlikely place: in the Great Plains of Kansas. Here, a sprawling, centuries-old lost city was discovered. A few years ago, Donald Blakeslee, an anthropologist and archaeology professor at Wichita State University, discovered the lost city of Etzanoa, located in present-day Arkansas City, Kansas. Locals in this small town in south-central Kansas had been finding arrowheads, pottery, and other ancient artifacts in the area\u2019s fields and rivers for decades, but no one ever knew the full extent of the archaeological gold mine hidden underneath their town. According to the Los Angeles Times, Blakeslee used newly translated documents written by the Spanish conquistadors who came across the land over 400 years ago to determine that these artifacts were once part of the Native American lost city of Etzanoa. \u201c\u2018I thought, \u2018Wow, their eyewitness descriptions are so clear it\u2019s like you were there,'\u201d Blakeslee told the Times about reading the conquistador\u2019s accounts. \u201cI wanted to see if the archaeology fit their descriptions.

The city of Etzanoa is believed to have been around from 1450 to 1700 and was home to approximately 20,000 people. Blakeslee said that the city was the second-largest settlement in the present-day United States at the time and spanned across at least five miles of the space between the Walnut and Arkansas rivers.

By Caelin Bragg The Great Plains has often been overlooked in the history books of North America, but recent discoveries made by a team of Wichita State University archaeologists are rewriting the history of where the beating heart of North American actually was in the pre-historic era before the arrival of Christopher Columbus. According to research findings by Dr. Don Blakeslee, professor of anthropology and archaeologist at Wichita State, it turns out that the Great Plains was much bigger and much more politically and economically influential in North America than previously thought. In 2018, Blakeslee discovered the forgotten town of Etzanoa outside of Arkansas City, Kansas. But what he didn\u2019t know until now is the true extent of what lies underground: An entire nation of ancestors of today\u2019s Wichita tribe towns \u2014 called Quivira \u2014 totaling more than 200,000 people, who traded goods all across North America and who even had a previously unknown common language. While some early Spanish documents mention Quivira, the region\u2019s significance was until now unknown to the modern understanding of pre-historic North America before Columbus. \u201cIt\u2019s going to revolutionize our view of the Great Plains societies, and it already has for me and my students,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cCharles Mann wrote (in the book) \u20181491\u2019 about the thriving Native American societies before the time of Columbus in South America, Central America and the American Southeast, but when he talked about the Great Plains, he called them distant and sparsely populated and occupied by hunters and gatherers. No. In its day, Quivira was probably the most important native political unit in what\u2019s now the United States.\u201d The people who created Quivira arrived in Kansas in the late 1300s, and Quivira was fully formed around 1450. The archaeological evidence shows that they grew crops but also hunted bison in huge numbers. Over 80% of the chipped-stone artifacts from the town of Etzanoa are specialized for processing bison products, and documentary evidence shows that these products were exported from coast to coast. This discovery shattered the previous understanding of who the people of the Great Plains were \u2014 from hunters and gatherers to a continent-spanning unit. Quivira is barely mentioned in history books because it was as remote as one could get from the early European colonies. Only three Spanish expeditions visited it between 1541 and 1601, and only two of them left documentary records. By the time of the first French visit in 1719, the nation was already in a steep decline. Its collapse started around 1610, when the Spanish founded Santa Fe and initiated a slave trade based on captives from the plains. The French in Canada and the English in Virginia and South Carolina soon joined them in supplying arms to their native allies in exchange for war prisoners. As a result, raiders from the west had horses and steel-topped weapons, while those from the east were armed with guns. The raids and diseases that Europeans brought to the continent destroyed Quivira around 1700. Blakeslee\u2019s findings \u2014 which he will present at the annual Society for American Archaeology meeting March 30-April 2 \u2014 focus on three types of evidence discovered about Etzanoa and Quivira: the documentary evidence, the linguistic evidence and the archaeological evidence. Blakeslee estimates the population of Quivira to have been roughly 200,000, a number that recontextualizes the scale of who occupied the Great Plains. This number is extrapolated from the eyewitness accounts of Etzanoa having a population of 17,000 to over 20,000 people and the presence of 10 or more large towns elsewhere in Quivira. The town of Etzanoa was originally listed as 22 separate sites until Blakeslee matched the eyewitness accounts to both the archaeological record and to the modern-day landscape. The other large towns discovered are still recorded as clusters of villages rather than large towns. When recorded more accurately as a connected society of large towns rather than unrelated villages, Blakeslee says, it\u2019s clear that Quivira was much more organized and far-reaching than anyone had previously thought. The Quiviran people also had hereditary chiefs, priests, interpreters and ambassadors they would send to neighboring nations. \u201cThey were an organized society, one far different from the Hollywood version,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cBut they have not been given any recognition at all in American history books.\u201d Evidence in documents from the earliest expeditions to the southwest of the continent shows that some people in Quivira could speak Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec empire. Additionally, Blakeslee has accumulated evidence showing that Nahuatl was the basis for a Lingua Franc\n\nquestion: Where is the lost city of Etzanoa located?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Etzanoa, located outside of Arkansas City, Kansas.", "usage": 1112}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It is the first clear documentation of a pre-historic native Lingua Franca in North America. Cabeza de Vaca, who was shipwrecked on Galveston Island and later walked to Mexico, was the first European to mention the Lingua Franca. In one passage, he mentioned people who used it would say \u201cxo\u201d (pronounced \u201cshow\u201d) to call a dog, and \u201carraca\u201d to get the attention of a person. Blakeslee, through a chance encounter during a Day of the Dead celebration in his neighborhood, met an individual from Guadalajara who confirmed the words to be Nahuatl, and even corrected the meaning of \u201carraca\u201d to mean \u201cwelcome\u201d instead. \u201cHere was the clincher,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cTwo words that are still in use that fit the context.\u201d The land area of Quivira was at least as large as the Republic of Ireland, with the currently documented borders being from the Kansas River in the north; the town of Larned, Kansas in the west; east into Missouri; and south into Oklahoma. Documents from the DeSoto expedition of 1539-1542 indicate large quantities of Quiviran bison products as far east as Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, including meat, robes and war gear such as rawhide shields, helmets and body armor that filled a room in a town in South Carolina. At the same time, other expeditions documented bison rawhide shields in use on the west coast of Mexico and along the Colorado River between Arizona and California. Tobacco pipes made by Quivirans have been found in sites created by the Apache, Pawnee, Missouria and Caddo tribes and in the pueblos of Pecos and Taos. The people of Quivira received various items in return. So far, Blakeslee has documented pottery in Quiviran sites that came from North Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas. These archaeological sites have yielded the northernmost example of a type of pottery made in the vicinity of El Paso, and the southernmost example of a type made in central North Dakota. The items that traveled the farthest are pieces of obsidian from central Mexico and Jalisco, far down the west coast. So far, Quiviran sites have yielded more of the central Mexican obsidian than all of the rest of the archaeological sites in the United States. Wichita State students working on this research with Blakeslee are receiving a hands-on learning experience they\u2019ll likely never forget. Kait Carter is a WSU graduate student majoring in anthropology who has found a passion in uncovering and illuminating the history of the site. \u201cThere\u2019s so much knowledge out there that could be acquired, and just reconstructing history is extremely interesting,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI wish a lot more people were in the field to try and help.\u201d Brogan Gillmore, a graduate student majoring in anthropology with a focus on public archaeology, is equally as excited to share the discoveries being made in the Great Plains. \u201cThe work we are doing here at WSU is really phenomenal,\u201d Gillmore said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of amazing stuff.

The 20,000 inhabitants of Etzanoa were said to have lived in \u201cthatched, beehive-shaped houses.\u201d In 1541, conquistador Francisco Vazquez de Coronado came to the town hoping to discover its fabled gold but instead found Native Americans in a collection of settlements that he called Quivira. Sixty years later in 1601, Juan de O\u00f1ate led a team of 70 conquistadors from New Mexico to Quivira, also hoping to find its gold but they ran into a tribe called the Escanxaques, who told them of the nearby city of Etzanoa. O\u00f1ate and his team arrived at the city and were greeted peacefully by the inhabitants of Etzanoa. However, things quickly went south when the conquistadors started taking hostages, which then caused the city\u2019s residents to flee in fear. The group of conquistadors explored the vast area of more than 2,000 houses but feared an attack from the peoples they dislodged and decided to return home. On their return trip, they were attacked by some 1,000 members of the Escanxaque tribe and a huge battle took place. The conquistadors lost and returned home to New Mexico, never to come back to the area again. French explorers came nearly a century later to that part of south-central Kansas but did not find any evidence of Etzanoa or its people. It is believed that disease caused the untimely demise of the population. However, traces of the people and their city would not stay hidden forever. Blakeslee and a team of excavators found the site of the ancient battle in a neighborhood in Arkansas City and found remanents from the battle. Locals in the area had been uncovering artifacts from the lost city for decades but didn\u2019t understand why until evidence of the city itself was discovered by Blakeslee. \u201cLots of artifacts have been taken from here,\u201d Warren \u201cHap\u201d McLeod, a resident of Arkansas City who lives on the spot where the battle took place, told the Times. \u201cNow we know why.

Archaeologists have made a groundbreaking and unlikely discovery in the Great Plains of Kansas: a sprawling, centuries-old lost city. A few years ago, Donald Blakeslee, an anthropologist and archaeology professor at Wichita State University, discovered the lost city of Etzanoa, located in present-day Arkansas City, Kan. Locals in this small town in south-central Kansas had been finding arrowheads, pottery, and other ancient artifacts in the area\u2019s fields and rivers for decades, but no one ever knew the full extent of the archaeological gold mine hidden underneath their town. According to the Los Angeles Times, Blakeslee used newly translated documents written by the Spanish conquistadors who came across the land over 400 years ago to determine that these artifacts were once part of the Native American lost city of Etzanoa. \u201c\u2018I thought, \u2018Wow, their eyewitness descriptions are so clear it\u2019s like you were there,'\u201d Blakeslee told the Times about reading the conquistador\u2019s accounts. \u201cI wanted to see if the archaeology fit their descriptions. Every single detail matched this place.\u201d The city of Etzanoa is believed to have been around from 1450 to 1700 and was home to approximately 20,000 people. Blakeslee said that the city was the second-largest settlement in the present-day United States at the time and spanned across at least five miles of the space between the Walnut and Arkansas rivers. The 20,000 inhabitants of Etzanoa were said to have lived in \u201cthatched, beehive-shaped houses.\u201d In 1541, conquistador Francisco Vazquez de Coronado came to the town hoping to discover its fabled gold but instead found Native Americans in a collection of settlements that he called Quivira. Sixty years later in 1601, Juan de O\u00f1ate led a team of 70 conquistadors from New Mexico to Quivira, also hoping to find its gold but they ran into a tribe called the Escanxaques, who told them of the nearby city of Etzanoa. O\u00f1ate and his team arrived at the city and were greeted peacefully by the inhabitants of Etzanoa. However, things quickly went south when the conquistadors started taking hostages, which then caused the city\u2019s residents to flee in fear. The group of conquistadors explored the vast area of more than 2,000 houses but feared an attack from the peoples they dislodged and decided to return home. On their return trip, they were attacked by some 1,000 members of the Escanxaque tribe and a huge battle took place. The conquistadors lost and returned home to New Mexico, never to come back to the area again. French explorers came nearly a century later to that part of south-central Kansas but did not find any evidence of Etzanoa or its people. It is believed that disease caused the untimely demise of the population. However, traces of the people and their city would not stay hidden forever. Blakeslee and a team of excavators found the site of the ancient battle in a neighborhood in Arkansas City and found remanents from the battle. Locals in the area had been uncovering artifacts from the lost city for decades but didn\u2019t understand why until evidence of the city itself was discovered by Blakeslee. \u201cLots of artifacts have been taken from here,\u201d Warren \u201cHap\u201d McLeod, a resident of Arkansas City who lives on the spot where the battle took place, told the Times. \u201cNow we know why. There were 20,000 people living here for over 200 years.\u201d David Kelly/The Los Angeles TimesRussell Bishop, a former Arkansas City resident, shows off the arrowheads he found in the area as a kid. One local resident said that the sheer amount of artifacts that people in the area have is mindblowing. \u201cMy boss had an entire basement full of pottery and all kinds of artifacts,\u201d Russell Bishop told the Times. \u201cWe\u2019d be out there working and he would recognize a black spot on the ground as an ancient campfire site \u2026 I don\u2019t think anyone knew how big this all was. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re finally getting to the bottom of it.\u201d The Great Plains were long-regarded as huge, empty spaces in ancient times that were populated mainly by nomadic tribes. But Blakeslee\u2019s discovery of Etzanoa could prove that some of the tribes in the area weren\u2019t nomadic and were actually more urban than previously believed.

By Caelin Bragg The Great Plains has often been overlooked in the history books of North America, but recent discoveries made by a team of Wichita State University archaeologists are rewriting the history of where the beating heart of North American actually was in the pre-historic era before the arrival of Christopher Columbus. According to research findings by Dr. Don Blakeslee, professor of anthropology and archaeologist at Wichita State, it turns out that the Great Plains was much bigger and much more politically and economically influential in North America than previously thought. In 2018, Blakeslee discovered the forgotten town of Etzanoa outside of Arkansas City, Kansas. But what he didn\u2019t know until now is the true extent of what lies underground: An entire nation of ancestors of today\u2019s Wichita tribe towns \u2014 called Quivira \u2014 totaling more than 200,000 people, who traded goods all across North America and who even had a previously unknown common language. While some early Spanish documents mention Quivira, the region\u2019s significance was until now unknown to the modern understanding of pre-historic North America before Columbus. \u201cIt\u2019s going to revolutionize our view of the Great Plains societies, and it already has for me and my students,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cCharles Mann wrote (in the book) \u20181491\u2019 about the thriving Native American societies before the time of Columbus in South America, Central America and the American Southeast, but when he talked about the Great Plains, he called them distant and sparsely populated and occupied by hunters and gatherers. No. In its day, Quivira was probably the most important native political unit in what\u2019s now the United States.\u201d The people who created Quivira arrived in Kansas in the late 1300s, and Quivira was fully formed around 1450. The archaeological evidence shows that they grew crops but also hunted bison in huge numbers. Over 80% of the chipped-stone artifacts from the town of Etzanoa are specialized for processing bison products, and documentary evidence shows that these products were exported from coast to coast. This discovery shattered the previous understanding of who the people of the Great Plains were \u2014 from hunters and gatherers to a continent-spanning unit. Quivira is barely mentioned in history books because it was as remote as one could get from the early European colonies. Only three Spanish expeditions visited it between 1541 and 1601, and only two of them left documentary records. By the time of the first French visit in 1719, the nation was already in a steep decline. Its collapse started around 1610, when the Spanish founded Santa Fe and initiated a slave trade based on captives from the plains. The French in Canada and the English in Virginia and South Carolina soon joined them in supplying arms to their native allies in exchange for war prisoners. As a result, raiders from the west had horses and steel-topped weapons, while those from the east were armed with guns. The raids and diseases that Europeans brought to the continent destroyed Quivira around 1700. Blakeslee\u2019s findings \u2014 which he will present at the annual Society for American Archaeology meeting March 30-April 2 \u2014 focus on three types of evidence discovered about Etzanoa and Quivira: the documentary evidence, the linguistic evidence and the archaeological evidence. Blakeslee estimates the population of Quivira to have been roughly 200,000, a number that recontextualizes the scale of who occupied the Great Plains. This number is extrapolated from the eyewitness accounts of Etzanoa having a population of 17,000 to over 20,000 people and the presence of 10 or more large towns elsewhere in Quivira. The town of Etzanoa was originally listed as 22 separate sites until Blakeslee matched the eyewitness accounts to both the archaeological record and to the modern-day landscape. The other large towns discovered are still recorded as clusters of villages rather than large towns. When recorded more accurately as a connected society of large towns rather than unrelated villages, Blakeslee says, it\u2019s clear that Quivira was much more organized and far-reaching than anyone had previously thought. The Quiviran people also had hereditary chiefs, priests, interpreters and ambassadors they would send to neighboring nations. \u201cThey were an organized society, one far different from the Hollywood version,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cBut they have not been given any recognition at all in American history books.\u201d Evidence in documents from the earliest expeditions to the southwest of the continent shows that some people in Quivira could speak Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec empire. Additionally, Blakeslee has accumulated evidence showing that Nahuatl was the basis for a Lingua Franc\n\nquestion: How large was the city of Etzanoa?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Roughly 200,000 people.", "usage": 1108}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It is the first clear documentation of a pre-historic native Lingua Franca in North America. Cabeza de Vaca, who was shipwrecked on Galveston Island and later walked to Mexico, was the first European to mention the Lingua Franca. In one passage, he mentioned people who used it would say \u201cxo\u201d (pronounced \u201cshow\u201d) to call a dog, and \u201carraca\u201d to get the attention of a person. Blakeslee, through a chance encounter during a Day of the Dead celebration in his neighborhood, met an individual from Guadalajara who confirmed the words to be Nahuatl, and even corrected the meaning of \u201carraca\u201d to mean \u201cwelcome\u201d instead. \u201cHere was the clincher,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cTwo words that are still in use that fit the context.\u201d The land area of Quivira was at least as large as the Republic of Ireland, with the currently documented borders being from the Kansas River in the north; the town of Larned, Kansas in the west; east into Missouri; and south into Oklahoma. Documents from the DeSoto expedition of 1539-1542 indicate large quantities of Quiviran bison products as far east as Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, including meat, robes and war gear such as rawhide shields, helmets and body armor that filled a room in a town in South Carolina. At the same time, other expeditions documented bison rawhide shields in use on the west coast of Mexico and along the Colorado River between Arizona and California. Tobacco pipes made by Quivirans have been found in sites created by the Apache, Pawnee, Missouria and Caddo tribes and in the pueblos of Pecos and Taos. The people of Quivira received various items in return. So far, Blakeslee has documented pottery in Quiviran sites that came from North Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas. These archaeological sites have yielded the northernmost example of a type of pottery made in the vicinity of El Paso, and the southernmost example of a type made in central North Dakota. The items that traveled the farthest are pieces of obsidian from central Mexico and Jalisco, far down the west coast. So far, Quiviran sites have yielded more of the central Mexican obsidian than all of the rest of the archaeological sites in the United States.

No. In its day, Quivira was probably the most important native political unit in what\u2019s now the United States.\u201d The people who created Quivira arrived in Kansas in the late 1300s, and Quivira was fully formed around 1450. The archaeological evidence shows that they grew crops but also hunted bison in huge numbers. Over 80% of the chipped-stone artifacts from the town of Etzanoa are specialized for processing bison products, and documentary evidence shows that these products were exported from coast to coast. This discovery shattered the previous understanding of who the people of the Great Plains were \u2014 from hunters and gatherers to a continent-spanning unit. Quivira is barely mentioned in history books because it was as remote as one could get from the early European colonies. Only three Spanish expeditions visited it between 1541 and 1601, and only two of them left documentary records. By the time of the first French visit in 1719, the nation was already in a steep decline. Its collapse started around 1610, when the Spanish founded Santa Fe and initiated a slave trade based on captives from the plains. The French in Canada and the English in Virginia and South Carolina soon joined them in supplying arms to their native allies in exchange for war prisoners. As a result, raiders from the west had horses and steel-topped weapons, while those from the east were armed with guns. The raids and diseases that Europeans brought to the continent destroyed Quivira around 1700. Blakeslee\u2019s findings \u2014 which he will present at the annual Society for American Archaeology meeting March 30-April 2 \u2014 focus on three types of evidence discovered about Etzanoa and Quivira: the documentary evidence, the linguistic evidence and the archaeological evidence. Blakeslee estimates the population of Quivira to have been roughly 200,000, a number that recontextualizes the scale of who occupied the Great Plains. This number is extrapolated from the eyewitness accounts of Etzanoa having a population of 17,000 to over 20,000 people and the presence of 10 or more large towns elsewhere in Quivira. The town of Etzanoa was originally listed as 22 separate sites until Blakeslee matched the eyewitness accounts to both the archaeological record and to the modern-day landscape. The other large towns discovered are still recorded as clusters of villages rather than large towns. When recorded more accurately as a connected society of large towns rather than unrelated villages, Blakeslee says, it\u2019s clear that Quivira was much more organized and far-reaching than anyone had previously thought. The Quiviran people also had hereditary chiefs, priests, interpreters and ambassadors they would send to neighboring nations. \u201cThey were an organized society, one far different from the Hollywood version,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cBut they have not been given any recognition at all in American history books.\u201d Evidence in documents from the earliest expeditions to the southwest of the continent shows that some people in Quivira could speak Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec empire. Additionally, Blakeslee has accumulated evidence showing that Nahuatl was the basis for a Lingua Franc\n\nquestion: What significance does the discovery of Etzanoa hold for the Great Plains societies?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "It's going to revolutionize our view of the Great Plains societies.", "usage": 1119}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It is the first clear documentation of a pre-historic native Lingua Franca in North America. Cabeza de Vaca, who was shipwrecked on Galveston Island and later walked to Mexico, was the first European to mention the Lingua Franca. In one passage, he mentioned people who used it would say \u201cxo\u201d (pronounced \u201cshow\u201d) to call a dog, and \u201carraca\u201d to get the attention of a person. Blakeslee, through a chance encounter during a Day of the Dead celebration in his neighborhood, met an individual from Guadalajara who confirmed the words to be Nahuatl, and even corrected the meaning of \u201carraca\u201d to mean \u201cwelcome\u201d instead. \u201cHere was the clincher,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cTwo words that are still in use that fit the context.\u201d The land area of Quivira was at least as large as the Republic of Ireland, with the currently documented borders being from the Kansas River in the north; the town of Larned, Kansas in the west; east into Missouri; and south into Oklahoma. Documents from the DeSoto expedition of 1539-1542 indicate large quantities of Quiviran bison products as far east as Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, including meat, robes and war gear such as rawhide shields, helmets and body armor that filled a room in a town in South Carolina. At the same time, other expeditions documented bison rawhide shields in use on the west coast of Mexico and along the Colorado River between Arizona and California. Tobacco pipes made by Quivirans have been found in sites created by the Apache, Pawnee, Missouria and Caddo tribes and in the pueblos of Pecos and Taos. The people of Quivira received various items in return. So far, Blakeslee has documented pottery in Quiviran sites that came from North Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas. These archaeological sites have yielded the northernmost example of a type of pottery made in the vicinity of El Paso, and the southernmost example of a type made in central North Dakota. The items that traveled the farthest are pieces of obsidian from central Mexico and Jalisco, far down the west coast. So far, Quiviran sites have yielded more of the central Mexican obsidian than all of the rest of the archaeological sites in the United States. Wichita State students working on this research with Blakeslee are receiving a hands-on learning experience they\u2019ll likely never forget. Kait Carter is a WSU graduate student majoring in anthropology who has found a passion in uncovering and illuminating the history of the site. \u201cThere\u2019s so much knowledge out there that could be acquired, and just reconstructing history is extremely interesting,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI wish a lot more people were in the field to try and help.\u201d Brogan Gillmore, a graduate student majoring in anthropology with a focus on public archaeology, is equally as excited to share the discoveries being made in the Great Plains. \u201cThe work we are doing here at WSU is really phenomenal,\u201d Gillmore said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of amazing stuff.
