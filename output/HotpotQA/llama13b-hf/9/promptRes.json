The Wilford H. Fawcett House is a house in Breezy Point, Minnesota, United States, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Wilford H. Fawcett, also known as \"Captain Billy\", started the book \"Captain Billy's Whiz Bang\" as a joke book for soldiers during World War I.  He formed Fawcett Publications in 1919 in Robbinsdale, Minnesota.  In 1920, he bought a tract of land where the present-day Breezy Point Resort is located, and he began building cottages and a large log lodge.  The lodge has since burnt down.  He built the Fawcett House as a private residence within the resort property.  Fawcett hired the Minneapolis architects of Magney and Tusler and commissioned the design in the Swiss Chateau style.  The rustic log style was a bit ironic, since the local logging industry had declined before the resort was built.\n\nquestion: On which American record label was Local H's 'Pack Up the Cats' released?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 305}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The 1978 United States Senate election in Illinois took place on November 7, 1978.  Incumbent Republican United States Senator Charles H. Percy ran for re-election to a third term in the United States Senate.  Percy was opposed by Democratic nominee Alex Seith, an attorney who had been appointed to several local government positions.  Though Percy had been expected to coast to re-election over Seith, a first-time candidate, the election quickly became competitive.  In the last few days of the campaign, a desperate Percy ran a television advertisement that featured him apologizing and acknowledging that, \"I got your message and you're right.\"  Percy's last-ditch effort appeared to have paid off, as he was able to edge out Seith to win what would end up being his third and final term in the Senate.\n\nquestion: On which American record label was Local H's 'Pack Up the Cats' released?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 275}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Mendocino County, California, was the first jurisdiction in the United States to ban the cultivation, production or distribution of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The ordinance, entitled Measure H, was passed by referendum on March 2, 2004.  Initiated by the group \"GMO Free Mendocino\", the campaign was a highly publicized grassroots effort by local farmers and environmental groups who contend that the potential risks of GMOs to human health and the ecosystem have not yet been fully understood.  The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry, The California Plant Health Association (now the Western Plant Health Association) and CropLife America, a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation, including Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical.  Since the enactment of the ordinance, Mendocino County has been added to an international list of \"GMO free zones.\"  Pre-emptive statutes banning local municipalities from such ordinances have now become widespread with adoption in sixteen states.\n\nquestion: Where have both bands toured extensively?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 304}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.
