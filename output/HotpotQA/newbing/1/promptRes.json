Although it was CBS's answer to NBC's A Date with Judy, it was also broadcast by NBC in 1948 as a summer replacement for The Bob Hope Show. From October 3, 1952, to June 26, 1953, it aired on ABC, finally returning to CBS. Despite the program's long run, fewer than 24 episodes are known to exist. Priscilla Lyon and Janet Waldo successively portrayed 15-year-old Corliss on radio. Lugene Sanders also played Corliss briefly on radio and in the CBS version of the Meet Corliss Archer television show. Perpetually perky, breathless and well-intentioned, Corliss is constantly at the side of her next-door neighbor and boyfriend, Dexter Franklin (Bill Christy, Sam Edwards). Clumsy, nerdy Dexter, a sweet but constant bungler with a nasal voice, is best remembered for his trademark phrase, \"Holy cow!\" and his braying call, \"Heyyyy, Corrrrrliiiiiss!\"\u2014frequently delivered from the hedge separating their houses. Harry Archer, Corliss's father, is a lawyer who tolerates Dexter only when he wants to use him to help flaunt male superiority. Gruff but gentle, he was played by Bob Bailey, Fred Shields and Frank Martin. Janet Archer, Corliss's mother, was played by, successively, Irene Tedrow, Monty Margetts and Gloria Holden. She is calm and understanding with her daughter and her husband, both of whom sometimes try her patience. Other frequent characters include Mildred Ames, a good friend of Corliss (played by Bebe Young and Barbara Whiting); Mildred's irritating younger brother Raymond (Tommy Bernard, Kenny Godkin); and Corliss's rival, Betty Cameron (Delores Crane). Meet Corliss Archer was written by F. Hugh Herbert, who first introduced the character and her friends in a Good Housekeeping magazine story \"A Private Affair,\" the first of a series of stories. Kiss and Tell was a 1943 play that was adapted for a 1945 film starring Shirley Temple. The 1949 sequel, A Kiss for Corliss, was re-released in 1954. Herbert's Meet Corliss Archer property was adapted to television in 1951 and 1952 with live broadcasts produced and aired by CBS. In 1954 and 1955 Ziv Television Programs produced a syndicated telefilm series starring Ann Baker and Mary Brian. One of the show's unique features was the occasional cut to a comic-book-style drawing, with announcer's commentary, that illustrated the current story situation and was used several times during each episode. The program was produced by Ziv Productions. Several episodes of the Ziv version are available on DVD, and some are also available from the Internet Archive. Robin Morgan portrayed Corliss in a live telecast of Kiss and Tell on The Alcoa Hour (August 5, 1956), with Warren Berlinger as Dexter. Radio listeners had to use their imaginations to visualize Corliss, her friends and her town. But those imaginations got a boost in 1948 when the Meet Corliss Archer comic book, published by Fox Feature Syndicate, came out in three issues from March to July 1948. Al Feldstein (Albert B. Feldstein), later the editor of Mad, was a key writer and illustrator of this short-lived comic book series, which is now remembered primarily for his artwork in general and the good girl art covers in particular. Film strips and radio microphones on the front cover indicated the tie-ins and media crossovers.

Since the early 1960s, she has been a key radical feminist member of the American Women's Movement, and a leader in the international feminist movement. Her 1970 anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful was cited by the New York Public Library as \"One of the 100 Most Influential Books of the 20th Century.\". She has written more than 20 books of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, and was editor of Ms. magazine. During the 1960s, she participated in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements; in the late 1960s, she was a founding member of radical feminist organizations such as New York Radical Women and W.I.T.C.H. She founded or co-founded the Feminist Women's Health Network, the National Battered Women's Refuge Network, Media Women, the National Network of Rape Crisis Centers, the Feminist Writers' Guild, the Women's Foreign Policy Council, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, GlobalSister.org, and Greenstone Women's Radio Network. She also co-founded the Women's Media Center with activist Gloria Steinem and actor/activist Jane Fonda. In 2018, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women. Due to circumstances at her birth, her mother claimed that Robin Morgan was born a year later than she actually was (see birth and parents), and throughout her career as a child actor, she was thought to be a year younger than she actually was, both by herself and others. Already as a toddler, her mother, Faith, and mother's sister Sally started Robin as a child model. At the age of five, believed to be four, she got her own program, titled Little Robin Morgan, on the New York radio station WOR. She was also a regular on the original network radio version of Juvenile Jury. Her acting career took off when she was eight and started in the TV series Mama, as Dagmar Hansen, the younger sister in the family depicted in the series. The show premiered on CBS in 1949, starring Peggy Wood, and was a great success. Morgan played Cecchina Cabrini in Citizen Saint (1947). During the Golden Age of Television, Morgan starred in such \"TV spectaculars\" as Kiss and Tell and Alice in Wonderland, and guest starred on such live dramas as Omnibus, Suspense, Danger, Hallmark Hall of Fame, Robert Montgomery Presents, Tales of Tomorrow, and Kraft Theatre. She worked with directors such as Sidney Lumet, John Frankenheimer, Ralph Nelson; writers such as Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling; and performed with actors such as Boris Karloff, Rosalind Russell, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, and Cliff Robertson. Having wanted to write rather than to act since she was four, Morgan fought her mother's efforts to keep her in show business, and left the cast of Mama at age 14. As she entered adulthood, Robin Morgan continued her education as a non-matriculating student at Columbia University. She began working as a secretary at Curtis Brown Literary Agency, where she met and worked with such writers as poet W. H. Auden in the early 1960s. She had already begun publishing her own poetry (later collected in her first book of poems, Monster, published in 1972). Throughout the next decades, along with political activism, writing fiction and nonfiction prose, and lecturing at colleges and universities on women's rights, Morgan continued to write and publish poetry. In 1962, Morgan married poet Kenneth Pitchford. She gave birth to their son, Blake Morgan, in 1969. The couple divorced in 1983. At that time, she was working as an editor at Grove Press and was involved in an attempt to unionize the publishing industry. When Grove summarily fired her and other union sympathizers, she led a seizure and occupation of their offices in the spring of 1970, protesting the union-busting, as well as the dishonest accounting of royalties to Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow. Morgan and eight other women were arrested that day. In the mid-1970s Morgan became a Contributing Editor to Ms. magazine, and continued her affiliation there as a part- or full-time editor in the following decades. She served as editor-in-chief of the magazine from 1989 to 1994, turning it into a highly successful, ad-free, bimonthly, international publication, which won awards for both writing and design, and received considerable acclaim among journalists. In 1979, when the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed, featuring famous women from politics, media and entertainment, culture, sports, and other areas of achievement, one of the cards featured Morgan's name and picture. Today, the trading cards are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the University of Iowa library. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film 'Kiss and Tell'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1145}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Seven years later, in 2012, she debuted a weekly radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live With Robin Morgan. The broadcast is syndicated in the US and, as a podcast, is published online at the WMCLive website, and distributed on iTunes in 110 countries. It has been praised by The Huffington Post as \"talk radio with a brain\" and features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. The weekly hour was picked up by CBS Radio two weeks after its launch and is broadcast on CBS affiliate WJFK each Saturday. The program features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. By 1962 Morgan had become active in the anti-war Left, and had also contributed articles and poetry to such Left-wing and counter-culture journals as Liberation, Rat, Win, and The National Guardian. In the 1960s she became increasingly involved in social-justice movements, notably the civil-rights and anti-Vietnam war. In early 1967, she was active in the Youth International Party (known in the media as the \"Yippies\"), with Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner. However, tensions over sexism within the YIP (and the New Left in general) came to a head when Morgan grew more involved in Women's Liberation and contemporary feminism. In 1967, Morgan became a founding member of the short-lived New York Radical Women group. She was the key organizer of their September 1968 inaugural protest of the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City. Morgan wrote the Miss America protest pamphlet No More Miss America!, and that same year cofounded Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.), a radical feminist group that used public street theater (called \"hexes\" or \"zaps\") to call attention to sexism. Morgan designed the universal symbol of the women\u2019s movement\u2013\u2013the female symbol, a circle with a cross beneath, centered with a raised fist. The Oxford English Dictionary also credits her with first using the term \"herstory\" in print in her 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful. Concerning the feminist organization W.I.T.C.H., Morgan wrote: With the royalties from her anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful, Morgan founded the first feminist grant-giving foundation in the US: The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, which provided seed money to many early women's groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s. She made a decisive break from what she described as the \"male Left\" when she led the women's takeover of the underground newspaper Rat in 1970, and listed the reasons for her break in the first women's issue of the paper, in her essay titled \"Goodbye to All That\". The essay gained notoriety in the press for naming specific sexist men and institutions in the Left. Decades later, during the Democratic primaries for the 2008 presidential race, Morgan wrote a fiery sequel to her original essay, titled \"Goodbye To All That #2\", in defense of Hillary Clinton. The article quickly went viral on the internet for lambasting sexist rhetoric directed towards Clinton by the media. In 1977, Morgan became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Morgan has traveled extensively across the United States and around the world to bring attention to cross-cultural sexism. She has met with and interviewed female rebel fighters in the Philippines, Brazilian women activists in the slums/favelas of Rio, women organizers in the townships of South Africa, and underground feminists in Iran. Twice\u2013\u2013in 1986 and 1989 she spent months in the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, West Bank, and Gaza, to report on the conditions of women. Morgan has also spoken at universities and institutions in countries across Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America, as well as in Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. Over the years, Morgan has received numerous awards for her activism on women\u2019s rights. The Feminist Majority Foundation named Robin Morgan \"Woman of the Year\" in 1990; she received the Warrior Woman Award for Promoting Racial Understanding from The Asian American Women's National Organization in 1992; in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now, and in 2003 The Feminist Press gave her a \"Femmy\" Award for her \"service to literature\". She has also received the Humanist Heroine Award from The American Humanist Association in 2007. In March 2012 Morgan, along with her Women's Media Center co-founders Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem, wrote an open letter asking listeners to request\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film 'Kiss and Tell'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1144}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They asked that stations licensed for public airwaves carrying Limbaugh be held accountable for contravening public interest as a continual promoter of hate speech against various disempowered and minority groups. In 1970, Morgan compiled, edited, and introduced the first anthology of feminist writings, Sisterhood is Powerful. The compilation included now-classic feminist essays by such activists as Naomi Weisstein, Kate Millett, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Florynce Kennedy, Frances M. Beal, Joreen, Marge Piercy, Lucinda Cisler and Mary Daly, as well as historical documents including the N.O.W. Bill of Rights, excerpts from the SCUM Manifesto, the Redstockings Manifesto, historical documents from W.I.T.C.H., and a germinal statement from the Black Women\u2019s Liberation Group of Mount Vernon. It also included what Morgan called \"verbal karate\": useful quotes and statistics about women. The anthology was cited by the New York Public Library as one of the \u201cNew York Public Library's Books of the  Century\u201d. Morgan established the first American feminist grant-giving organization, The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, with the royalties from Sisterhood Is Powerful. However, the anthology was banned in Chile, China, and South Africa. Her follow-up volume in 1984, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology, compiled articles about women in over seventy countries. That same year she founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, notable for being the first international feminist think tank. Repeatedly refusing the post of president, she was elected secretary of the organization from 1989 to 1993, was VP from 1993 to 1997, and after serving on the advisory board, finally agreed to become president in 2004. A third volume, Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium in 2003, was a collection of articles mostly by well-known feminists, both young and \"vintage\", in a retrospective on and future blueprint for the feminist movement. It was compiled, edited, and with an introduction by Morgan, and Morgan wrote \"To Vintage Feminists\" and \"To Younger Women\", which were both included in the anthology as Personal Postscripts. Morgan's articles, essays, reviews, interviews, political analyses, and investigative journalism have appeared widely in such publications as The Atlantic, Broadsheet, Chrysalis, Essence, Everywoman, The Feminist Art Journal, The Guardian (US), The Guardian (UK), The Hudson Review, the Los Angeles Times, Ms., The New Republic, The New York Times, Off Our Backs, Pacific Ways, The Second Wave, Sojourner, The Village Voice, The Voice of Women, and various United Nations periodicals, etc. Articles and essays have also appeared in reprint in international media, in English across the Commonwealth, and in translation in 13 languages in Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. Morgan has served as a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for many years, receiving the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism for her cover story titled \"The First Feminist Exiles from the USSR\" in 1981. She served as the magazine's editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, re-launching it as an ad-free, international bimonthly publication in 1991. This earned her a series of awards, including the award for Editorial Excellence by Utne Reader in 1991, and the Exceptional Merit in Journalism Award by the National Women's Political Caucus. Morgan resigned her post in 1994 to become Consulting Global Editor of the magazine, which she remains to this day. Morgan has written for online audiences and blogged frequently. Among her best known articles are \"Letters from Ground Zero\" (written and posted after the September 11 attacks in 2001 \u2014 which went viral), \"Goodbye To All That #2\", \"Women of the Arab Spring\", \"When Bad News is Good News: Notes of a Feminist News Junkie\", \"Manhood and Moral Waivers\", and \"Faith Healing: A Modest Proposal on Religious Fundamentalism\". Her online work is hosted in the archives of the Women's Media Center. Robin Morgan has published 21 books, including works of poetry, fiction, and the now-classic anthologies Sisterhood Is Powerful, Sisterhood Is Global, and Sisterhood Is Forever. Well before she was known as a feminist leader, literary magazines published her as a serious poet. According to a 1972 review of her first book of poems, Monster, in The Washington Post: \" establish Morgan as a poet of considerable means. There is a savage elegance, a richness of vocabulary, a thrust and steely polish..... A powerful, challenging book.\" In 1979 Morgan received a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in poetry,\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film 'Kiss and Tell'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1146}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

During this time she worked on a cycle of verse plays. Morgan\u2019s poetry collections include A Hot January: Poems 1996\u20131999 (W. W. Norton, 1999), Depth Perception: New Poems and a Masque (Doubleday, 1994), Upstairs in the Garden: Poems Selected and New 1968\u20131988 (W. W. Norton, 1990), Death Benefits (Copper Canyon Press, 1981), Lady of the Beasts (Random House, 1976), and Monster (Random House, 1972). Of the book A Hot January, Alice Walker wrote: \"Morgan proves that exquisite poetry can be the most surprising gift of grief. A volume as proud, fierce, vulnerable, and brave as the poet herself.\" A review of Upstairs in the Garden, noted: \"As a vindication and celebration of the female experience, these inventive poems successfully wed feminist rhetoric with vivid imagery and sensitivity to the music of language.\" Two books of poems, Lady of the Beasts and Depth Perception, earned reviews in Poetry Magazine with critic Jay Parini stating that \"Robin Morgan will soon be regarded as one of our first-ranking poets.\" Morgan had published three books of fiction as of 2015. Her debut novel was the semi-autobiographical Dry Your Smile (published by Doubleday & Company, 1987), followed by The Mer-Child: A Legend for Children and Other Adults (published by The Feminist Press at City University of New York, 1991). Her most recent work of fiction is a historical novel titled The Burning Time (Melville House Books, 2006), set in the 14th century, based on court records of the first witchcraft trial in Ireland. The Burning Time was placed on the Recommended Quality Fiction List of 2007 by the American Library Association, in addition to being the 2006 Paperback Pick by Book Sense (The American Booksellers Association). Morgan has compiled, edited, and introduced several influential anthologies: Sisterhood Is Powerful: The Women\u2019s Liberation Anthology (1970), Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), and Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003). She has herself written non-fiction, including Going Too Far (1978), The Anatomy of Freedom (1984), The Demon Lover: On the Sexuality of Terrorism (1989), The Word of a Woman (1994), and Saturday\u2019s Child: A Memoir (2001). One of the most widely translated of Morgan\u2019s books and a best-seller, The Demon Lover is a commentary on the psychological and political roots of terrorism, and New York Times Book Review called it \"Important...compelling.... is intense and at times magnificent.\" Her most recently published book of non-fiction is Fighting Words: A Tool Kit for Combating the Religious Right (2006). In 1984, Morgan, together with the late Simone de Beauvoir of France, and women from 80 other countries, founded The Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI), an international non-profit NGO with consultative status to the United Nations, which has for three decades functioned as the world\u2019s first feminist think-tank. The Institute has played a leading policy-formulation, strategic, and activist role in the evolution of the international Women\u2019s Movement. SIGI has also developed a global communications network through which an umbrella of NGO interest, advice, contacts, and support is collectively mobilized to empower the global women\u2019s movement. Among its many activities, the Institute pioneered the first Urgent Acton Alerts regarding women\u2019s rights; the first Global Campaign To Make Visible Women\u2019s Unpaid Labor In National Accounts; and the first Women\u2019s Rights Manuals For Muslim Societies (in 12 languages). Its most recent project is Donor Direct Action (donordirectaction.org), which links front-line women\u2019s rights activists around the world to money, visibility, and popular support: minimum bureaucracy, maximum impact. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit progressive organization, The Women\u2019s Media Center with her friends actor/activist Jane Fonda, and activist Gloria Steinem. The focus of the organization is to make women powerful and visible in the media. An invited speaker at numerous universities in North America, Morgan has traveled\u2014as organizer, speaker, journalist\u2014across North America, Europe, and the Middle East to Australia, Brazil, the Caribbean, Central America, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. She has also been a guest professor or scholar in residence at a variety of academic institutions. She was guest chair for feminist studies at the New College of Florida in 1971; a visiting professor at The Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture at Rutgers University in 1987; a distinguished visiting scholar in residence for literary and cultural studies at the University of Canterbury, Christ\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film 'Kiss and Tell'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1129}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She was awarded an honorary degree as a Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs in 1992. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection that documents the personal, political, and professional aspects of Morgan's life, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. They date from the 1940s to the present. Robin Morgan has been arrested, and has received death threats from both the Right and the Left because of her activism. According to a New Yorker magazine article published in the aftermath of Morgan's essay \"Goodbye to All That\" (#2) going viral on the Internet, \"At five feet tall Morgan is, not for the first time, the little woman who has started a big war.\" In her original essay, \"Goodbye to All That\" (1970), Morgan bade adieu to \"the dream that being in the leadership collective will get you anything but gonorrhea,\" referring to the \"male Left\". She also asserted that Charles Manson was \"only the logical extreme of the normal American male\u2019s fantasy.\" Two years later, Morgan published the poem \"Arraignment\", in which she openly accused Ted Hughes of the battery and murder of Sylvia Plath. There were lawsuits, Morgan's 1972 book Monster which contained that poem was banned, and underground, pirated feminist editions of it were published. As the leading organizer of the 1968 protest of the Miss America Pageant, \"No More Miss America!\", Morgan attacked the pageant\u2019s \"ludicrous 'beauty' standards and also accused the pageant of being racist, since at that time no African American woman had been a contestant. In addition\u2013\u2013according to Morgan\u2013\u2013in sending pageant winners to entertain troops in Vietnam, the women served as \"death mascots\" in an immoral war. Morgan asked, \"Where else could one find such a perfect combination of American values -- racism, militarism, capitalism -- all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol, a woman.\" Another controversial quote is from her 1978 book, Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist, where she stated: \"I feel that \"man-hating\" is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.\" Morgan famously walked off The Tonight Show in 1969 when it screened vintage footage of her as a child actor while she was trying to speak seriously about the first national march against rape. Of the incident, she has been quoted as saying: \"Imagine talking about such a subject and having it trivialized like that.\" In 1974, with her phrase \"Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice\" (from her essay \"Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape\"), she became a central figure on one of the divisive issues in feminism, particularly among anti-pornography feminists in Anglophone countries. In 1973, Robin Morgan gave the keynote speech at the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in which she criticized Beth Elliott, a performer and organizer of the conference, for being a transgender woman. In this speech she referred to Elliott as a \"transsexual male\" and used male pronouns throughout, charging her with being \"an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer-with the mentality of a rapist.\" At the end of her speech she called for a vote on ejecting Elliott, with over two-thirds voting to allow her to remain, however the minority threatened to disrupt the conference and Elliott chose to leave after her performance to avoid this. The event demonstrated the high tension surrounding transgender women's involvement in the women's movement of the 1970s. Robin Morgan grew up in New York, first in Mount Vernon, and later in Manhattan, on Sutton Place. She graduated from The Wetter School in Mount Vernon, in 1956, and was privately tutored from then until 1959. She published her first serious poetry in literary magazines at age 17. In an article published in the Jewish Women's Archive, Morgan reveals she is of Jewish ancestry, but identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She is quoted as saying, \"When compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Ashkenazic (with a touch of Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\" Morgan continues to tackle topics such as religion, politics and sex in fiery commentaries on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan.

In her book, \"her passion for writing, especially poetry, is vividly conveyed, as is her love and respect for her son, born in 1969,\" according to The New York Times Book Review. In April 2013, Morgan announced publicly that she had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, discussing the diagnosis on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan, revealing that she had been diagnosed in 2010, but that her quality of life was thus far \"normal\". Since her diagnosis, Morgan has become active with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation (PDF), completing training to become part of the organization's Parkinson's Advocates in Research initiative. In 2014 she was the catalyst and took a leadership role in PDF's new Women and PD initiative, which will seek to better serve women impacted by Parkinson's disease by understanding and resolving gender inequalities in PD research, treatment, and caregiver support. Morgan has also written new poetry inspired by her battle with the disease, and performed a reading of some of the poems as a TED Talk, at the TEDWomen 2015 conference. Her mother, Faith Berkeley Morgan, traveled from her New York residence to Florida to give birth, in order to avoid public scrutiny for her unmarried status. Robin's father, a medical doctor named Mates Morgenstern, did not accompany pregnant Faith on her trip. Until Morgan was 13 years old, her mother Faith claimed that Robin's father had been killed in World War II. However, Robin overheard conversations between her mother and aunt suggesting her father was alive. When she confronted her mother, Faith changed her story to assert that Robin's father had escaped from one Nazi concentration camp after another, and that she had saved his life by sponsoring his immigration to the United States where he had no family. Not until several years later did Robin get proof that this was also a lie. Morgan learned the truth, both about her father, who was still alive, and how old she really was, early in 1961. Now a young woman, no longer working in show business, Robin found a listing for the medical practice of an obstetrician, Dr. Mates Morgenstern, in the New Brunswick, New Jersey telephone directory. Suspecting this might be her father, she had sought a meeting with him, without her mother's knowledge, and ultimately paid a surprise visit to his New Jersey office in January 1961. Morgenstern revealed that he was aware of Robin's fame as a child actor, but had remained firm in his decision to avoid contact with Faith Morgan, having chosen not to see her again after the only time he visited her and the infant Robin. He also told Robin, during their conversation in his medical office, that she in fact was born on January 29, 1941, exactly one year earlier than she thought, and disclosed the copy of her original birth certificate, that he had stored in his office. In order to conceal the out-of-wedlock birth, Faith Morgan had asked her Florida obstetrician to sign an affidavit stating that the birth took place on January 29, 1942. During the conversation in his office, Morgenstern told his daughter that he first met her mother after his arrival in the United States, more than a year before the United States entered World War II, and that she had had nothing to do with his immigration. He added that he had known Faith only briefly and claimed that she had fantasized their relationship as more important than it was. By the time Morgan met her father he had married and had two sons with a woman he had known since they were both children in Austria. Having been separated by the war, they resumed their relationship after she arrived in the United States not long after Robin was born, which probably also added to Morgenstern's decision to abandon Faith and their daughter. Morgan only met her father once more, in February 1965 when he invited her and her husband to his New Jersey home. Morgenstern did not want his sons to know that they had a half-sister and Morgan acceded to his request that they tell his two sons that she was \"the daughter of an old friend.\" She refused to do so again, however, and never met him or her two half-brothers again. Morgan describes the two encounters that she had with her biological father in her autobiography, Saturday's Child: A Memoir.

The play's great success led to offers from Hollywood for Caulfield, who left the production almost one year to the day from when it opened, and was replaced in her role by her sister Betty Caulfield. Kiss and Tell premiered at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston on March 1, 1943 for tryout performances before its Broadway run. It opened in New York City on March 17, 1943 at the Biltmore Theatre. It remained there until the end of 1944, before transferring to the Bijou Theatre in 1945. It ran for a total of 956 performances before closing on June 23, 1945. The original production was produced by George Abbott and written by F. Hugh Herbert. The cast included Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer, Jessie Royce Landis as Janet Archer, Frances Bavier as Louise, Walter Davis as Uncle George, John Harvey as Private Earhart, Lulu Mae Hubbard as Dorothy Pringle, Robert Keith as Harry Archer, James Lane as Mr. Willard, Tommy Lewis as Raymond Pringle, Robert Lynn as Robert Pringle, Judith Parrish as Mildred Pringle, Calvin Thomas as Bill Franklin, Paula Trueman as Mary Franklin, Robert White as Dexter Franklin, and Richard Widmark as Lieut. Lenny Archer. Two teenage girls become interested in boys, and the girls' parents are making more problems rather than solving them. A film version written by Herbert and based on his play was released by Columbia Pictures on October 4, 1945 with Shirley Temple in the role of Corliss Archer. The film was directed by Richard Wallace and produced by Sol C. Siegel. Temple would reprise the role in the film's sequel A Kiss for Corliss in 1949.\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film 'Kiss and Tell'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Shirley Temple", "usage": 501}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In 1962 she became active in the civil rights and feminist movements, quickly becoming a leader. She worked as a contributing editor for Ms. Magazine for twenty years, serving as editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994. Her editing of the Sisterhood anthologies (beginning with Sisterhood Is Powerful in 1970) has a significant impact on the feminist movement. In 1984 Morgan founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, a think tank for women\u2019s rights worldwide. Morgan continues to write and lecture around the world in addition to hosting a weekly radio and online podcast and webcast program entitled \u201cWomen\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan.\u201d \u201cIf I had to name a single quality characteristic of patriarchy, it would be compartmentalization, the capacity for institutionalizing disconnection. Intellect severed from emotion. Thought separated from action. Science split from art. The earth itself divided\u2014national borders.... The personal isolated from the political. Sex divorced from love\u2026Law detached from justice\u2026If I had to name a single quality characteristic of global feminism, it would be connectivity\u2014a capacity dangerous to every status quo, because of its insistence on noticing.\u201d In her lifetime battle for women\u2019s dignity and global change, Robin Morgan uses words as ammunition, as one can see in the above quotation from The Word of a Woman (1992). As poet, novelist, journalist, lecturer, and feminist theorist, she expresses the reality of contemporary women\u2019s oppression. Morgan was born on January 29, 1941, daughter of Faith Berkeley Morgan, in Lake Worth, Florida. As a child, Morgan\u2019s mother told her that her father had been killed in World War II and later told her other false stories about his identity and fate. Morgan learned the true identity of her father, an obstetrician/gynecologist named Mates Morgenstern, in 1961 when she was nineteen years old. They met only once in person in 1965. When Morgan was not yet a year old, her mother entered her in baby contests and she began a career first as a child model, and later as a child actor and radio personality. She remained a public figure, starring in primetime dramas and specials as well as working on the stage, until the age of fourteen, when she left the limelight to do what she really wanted: to write. Though she never formally enrolled in college, Morgan attended (nonmatriculated) classes and lectures at Columbia University and remained in New York City. At the age of seventeen, she published her first serious poetry in a literary magazine. In 1962, Morgan married writer Kenneth Pitchford, whom she divorced in 1990. Together they had one son, Blake Morgan-Pitchford, born in 1969. Morgan identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She writes: \u201cWhen compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Jews of European origin and their descendants, including most of North and South American Jewry.Ashkenazic (with a touch of Descendants of the Jews who lived in Spain and Portugal before the explusion of 1492; primarily Jews of N. Africa, Italy, the Middle East and the Balkans.Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. And I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\u201d Morgan became an activist during the 1960s and was involved in the civil rights movement, SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee), and the anti-Vietnam War movement. She was also a founding member of New York Radical Women and other radical feminist organizations, such as W.I.T.C.H, which she co-founded in 1968. She was one of the key organizers of the 1968 protest at Atlantic City\u2019s Miss America Contest, which helped launch the second wave of United States feminism. She later reflected on the Miss America pageant, its practices, and the 1968 protest: \u201cwhere else could one find such a perfect combination of American values\u2014racism, militarism, capitalism\u2014all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol: a woman\u201d (Word of a Woman: Feminist Dispatches, 1968-1992). In the following decades, Morgan spearheaded the international women\u2019s liberation movement through her continued activism, her steadfast publishing of feminist poetry and prose, her work as a feminist journalist and editor, and her passionate international lecturing. Morgan coined the term \u201cherstory\u201d in her first published anthology, Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film 'Kiss and Tell'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1118}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Morgan also funded The Sisterhood is Powerful Fund, the first feminist foundation in the United States, with royalties from Sisterhood is Powerful. In 1970, Morgan helped lead the women\u2019s takeover of Rat, a leftist newspaper. Women staffers at the paper and previous contributors like Morgan seized the paper for an issue and never gave it back. In the first women\u2019s issue of the paper, titled \u201cWomen Seize RAT! Sabotage Tales!,\u201d Morgan published what became the famous essay, \u201cGoodbye to All That,\u201d in which she addressed sexism on the Left and \u201cLeftist men\u2019s betrayal of women.\u201d Throughout her career, Morgan has traveled far and wide to interview women rebel fighters in the Philippines, Palestinian women activists in the Intifada, and women in postrevolutionary Iran. She was a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for twenty years, serving as its editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, when it was relaunched as an advertisement-free publication. Since August 2012, Morgan has hosted a nationally syndicated weekly American radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan, in which she discusses current events, interviews guests, produces in-depth investigative reports, and offers commentary on a host of contemporary issues. Morgan has written more than twenty books, including five books of poetry, two novels, and numerous books of essays. She is best known as editor of several important anthologies. Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings from the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement (1970) gives voice to American feminists of the 1960s. These raw and immediate essays cover topics such as female orgasm, the nature of prostitution, the lives of radical lesbians, and the challenge of being Black and female. Morgan\u2019s second groundbreaking edited volume, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), compiles articles about the status of women in seventy countries. In 1984 Morgan co-founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI) with Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986), bringing together the writers of the anthology at an organizing conference. SIGI functions as a think-tank on women\u2019s human rights worldwide. Morgan is also co-founder of The Women\u2019s Media Center with Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem. A third anthology, Sisterhood is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003) was a well-received collection of articles by prominent feminists in which Morgan exhorted both young and the \u201cvintage\u201d feminists to take credit for the astounding and irreversible revolution they brought about. Morgan has since published several further works of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including Fighting Words: A Toolkit for Combating the Religious Right (2006) and a novel, Parallax, published in 2019. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection documenting aspects of Morgan\u2019s political history, personal life, and professional works, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. Morgan has received numerous awards, including the National Endowment for the Arts prize in poetry, the 1990 Feminist Majority Foundation Woman of the Year Award, and the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism. She has also been awarded grants from the Ford Foundation and received prizes for her editorial excellence. In 1992, Morgan was awarded an Honorary Degree as Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs, and in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now. Morgan was also awarded a \u201cFemmy\u201d award from the Feminist Press in 2003 for her \u201cservice to literature\u201d and in 2007 was awarded a Humanist Heroine Award by the American Humanist Association.

The conference had been convened by a group that wanted to defend two positions that have made radical feminism anathema to much of the left. First, the organizers hoped to refute charges that the desire to ban prostitution implies hostility toward prostitutes. Then they were going to try to explain why, at a time when transgender rights are ascendant, radical feminists insist on regarding transgender women as men, who should not be allowed to use women\u2019s facilities, such as public rest rooms, or to participate in events organized exclusively for women. The dispute began more than forty years ago, at the height of the second-wave feminist movement. In one early skirmish, in 1973, the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in Los Angeles, furiously split over a scheduled performance by the folksinger Beth Elliott, who is what was then called a transsexual. Robin Morgan, the keynote speaker, said: I will not call a male \u201cshe\u201d; thirty-two years of suffering in this androcentric society, and of surviving, have earned me the title \u201cwoman\u201d; one walk down the street by a male transvestite, five minutes of his being hassled (which he may enjoy), and then he dares, he dares to think he understands our pain? No, in our mothers\u2019 names and in our own, we must not call him sister. Such views are shared by few feminists now, but they still have a foothold among some self-described radical feminists, who have found themselves in an acrimonious battle with trans people and their allies. Trans women say that they are women because they feel female\u2014that, as some put it, they have women\u2019s brains in men\u2019s bodies. Radical feminists reject the notion of a \u201cfemale brain.\u201d They believe that if women think and act differently from men it\u2019s because society forces them to, requiring them to be sexually attractive, nurturing, and deferential. In the words of Lierre Keith, a speaker at Radfems Respond, femininity is \u201critualized submission.\u201d In this view, gender is less an identity than a caste position. Anyone born a man retains male privilege in society; even if he chooses to live as a woman\u2014and accept a correspondingly subordinate social position\u2014the fact that he has a choice means that he can never understand what being a woman is really like. By extension, when trans women demand to be accepted as women they are simply exercising another form of male entitlement. All this enrages trans women and their allies, who point to the discrimination that trans people endure; although radical feminism is far from achieving all its goals, women have won far more formal equality than trans people have. In most states, it\u2019s legal to fire someone for being transgender, and transgender people can\u2019t serve in the military. A recent survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force found overwhelming levels of anti-trans violence and persecution. Forty-one per cent of respondents said that they had attempted suicide. Yet, at the same time, the trans-rights movement is growing in power and cachet: a recent Time cover featuring the actress Laverne Cox was headlined \u201cTHE TRANSGENDER TIPPING POINT.\u201d The very word \u201ctransgender,\u201d which first came into wide use in the nineteen-nineties, encompasses far more people than the term \u201ctranssexual\u201d did. It includes not just the small number of people who seek gender-reassignment surgery\u2014according to frequently cited estimates, about one in thirty thousand men and one in a hundred thousand women\u2014but also those who take hormones, or who simply identify with the opposite gender, or, in some cases, with both or with neither. (According to the National Center survey, most trans women have taken female hormones, but only about a quarter of them have had genital surgery.) The elasticity of the term \u201ctransgender\u201d has forced a rethinking of what sex and gender mean; at least in progressive circles, what\u2019s determinative isn\u2019t people\u2019s chromosomes or their genitals or the way that they were brought up but how they see themselves. Having rejected this supposition, radical feminists now find themselves in a position that few would have imagined when the conflict began: shunned as reactionaries on the wrong side of a sexual-rights issue. It is, to them, a baffling political inversion. Radfems Respond was originally to have taken place across town from the library, at a Quaker meeting house, but trans activists had launched a petition on Change\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film 'Kiss and Tell'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1066}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They said that, in hosting it, the Quakers would alienate trans people and \u201cbe complicit in the violence against them.\u201d The Quakers, citing concerns in their community, revoked the agreement. It wasn\u2019t the first time that such an event had lost a scheduled venue. The Radfem 2012 conference was to be held in London, at Conway Hall, which bills itself as \u201ca hub for free speech and independent thought.\u201d But trans activists objected both to Radfem\u2019s women-only policy\u2014which was widely understood to exclude trans women\u2014and to the participation of Sheila Jeffreys, a professor of political science at the University of Melbourne. Jeffreys was scheduled to speak on prostitution, but she is a longtime critic of the transgender movement, and Conway Hall officials decided that they could not allow speakers who \u201cconflict with our ethos, principles, and culture.\u201d Ultimately, the event was held at a still secret location; organizers escorted delegates to it from a nearby meeting place. Radfem 2013 also had to switch locations, as did a gathering in Toronto last year, called Radfems Rise Up. In response, thirty-seven radical feminists, including major figures from the second wave, such as Ti-Grace Atkinson, Kathie Sarachild, and Michele Wallace, signed a statement titled \u201cForbidden Discourse: The Silencing of Feminist Criticism of \u2018Gender,\u2019 \u201d which described their \u201calarm\u201d at \u201cthreats and attacks, some of them physical, on individuals and organizations daring to challenge the currently fashionable concept of gender.\u201d With all this in mind, the Radfems Respond organizers had arranged the library space as a backup, but then a post on Portland Indymedia announced: We questioned the library administration about allowing a hate group who promotes discrimination and their response is that they cannot kick them out because of freedom of speech. So we also exercise our right to free speech in public space this Saturday to drive the TERFS and Radfems out of OUR library and OUR Portland! (TERF stands for \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminist.\u201d The term can be useful for making a distinction with radical feminists who do not share the same position, but those at whom it is directed consider it a slur.) Abusive posts proliferated on Twitter and, especially, Tumblr. One read, \u201c/kill/terfs 2K14.\u201d Another suggested, \u201chow about \u2018slowly and horrendously murder terfs in saw-like torture machines and contraptions\u2019 2K14.\u201d A young blogger holding a knife posted a selfie with the caption \u201cFetch me a terf.\u201d Such threats have become so common that radical-feminist Web sites have taken to cataloguing them. \u201cIt\u2019s aggrieved entitlement,\u201d Lierre Keith told me. \u201cThey are so angry that we will not see them as women.\u201d Keith is a writer and an activist who runs a small permaculture farm in Northern California. She is forty-nine, with cropped pewter hair and a uniform of black T-shirts and jeans. Three years ago, she co-founded the ecofeminist group Deep Green Resistance, which has some two hundred members and links the oppression of women to the pillaging of the planet. D.G.R. is defiantly militant, refusing to condemn the use of violence in the service of goals it considers just. In radical circles, though, what makes the group truly controversial is its stance on gender. As members see it, a person born with male privilege can no more shed it through surgery than a white person can claim an African-American identity simply by darkening his or her skin. Before D.G.R. held its first conference, in 2011, in Wisconsin, the group informed a person in the process of a male-to-female transition that she couldn\u2019t stay in the women\u2019s quarters. \u201cWe said, That\u2019s fine if you want to come, but, no, you\u2019re not going to have access to the women\u2019s sleeping spaces and the women\u2019s bathrooms,\u201d Keith told me. Last February, Keith was to be a keynote speaker at the Public Interest Environmental Law Conference, at the University of Oregon, in Eugene, but the student government voted to condemn her, and more than a thousand people signed a petition demanding that the address be cancelled. Amid threats of violence, six policemen escorted Keith to the lectern, though, in the end, the protest proved peaceful: some audience members walked out and held a rally, leaving her to speak to a half-empty room. Keith had an easier time at Radfems Respond, where she spoke on the differences between radicalism and liberalism.

A men\u2019s-rights activist showed up\u2014he later posted mocking clips from a video that he had secretly made\u2014but said nothing during the sessions. Several trans women arrived and sat at the back, but, in fact, they were there to express solidarity, having decided that the attacks on radical feminists were both out of control and misguided. One of them, a thin, forty-year-old blonde from the Bay Area, who blogs under the name Snowflake Especial, noted that all the violence against trans women that she\u2019s aware of was committed by men. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we dealing with them?\u201d she asked. Despite that surprising show of support, most of the speakers felt embattled. Heath Atom Russell gave the closing talk. A stocky woman, with curly turquoise hair and a bluish stubble shadow on her cheeks, she wore a T-shirt that read \u201cI Survived Testosterone Poisoning.\u201d At twenty-five, she is a \u201cdetransitioner,\u201d a person who once identified as transgender but no longer does. (Expert estimates of the number of transitioners who abandon their new gender range from fewer than one per cent to as many as five per cent.) Russell, a lesbian who grew up in a conservative Baptist family in Southern California, began transitioning to male as a student at Humboldt State University, and was embraced by gender-rights groups on campus. She started taking hormones and changed her name. Then, in her senior year, she discovered \u201cUnpacking Queer Politics\u201d (2003), by Sheila Jeffreys, which critiques female-to-male transsexualism as capitulation to misogyny. At first, the book infuriated Russell, but she couldn\u2019t let go of the questions that it raised about her own identity. She had been having heart palpitations, which made her uneasy about the hormones she was taking. Nor did she ever fully believe herself to be male. At one point during her transition, she hooked up with a middle-aged trans woman. Russell knew that she was supposed to think of herself as a man with a woman, but, she said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right, and I was scared.\u201d Eventually, she proclaimed herself a woman again, and a radical feminist, though it meant being ostracized by many of her friends. She is now engaged to a woman; someone keyed the word \u201cdyke\u201d on her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s car. Russell appears in Sheila Jeffreys\u2019s new book, \u201cGender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism.\u201d Jeffreys, who is sixty-six, has short silver hair and a weathered face. She has taught at the University of Melbourne for twenty-three years, but she grew up in London, and has been described as the Andrea Dworkin of the U.K. She has written nine previous books, all of which focus on the sexual subjugation of women, whether through rape, incest, pornography, prostitution, or Western beauty norms. Like Dworkin, she is viewed as a heroine by a cadre of like-minded admirers and as a zealot by others. In 2005, in an admiring feature in the Guardian, Julie Bindel wrote, \u201cJeffreys sees sexuality as the basis of the oppression of women by men, in much the same way as Marx saw capitalism as the scourge of the working class. This unwavering belief has made her many enemies. Postmodern theorist Judith Halberstam once said, \u2018If Sheila Jeffreys did not exist, Camille Paglia would have had to invent her.\u2019 \u201d In eight brisk chapters (half of them written with Jeffreys\u2019s former Ph.D. student Lorene Gottschalk), \u201cGender Hurts\u201d offers Jeffreys\u2019s first full-length treatment of transgenderism. Ordinarily, Jeffreys told me, she would launch the publication of a new book with an event at the university, but this time campus security warned against it. She has also taken her name off her office door. She gave a talk in London this month, but it was invitation-only. In the book, Jeffreys calls detransitioners like Russell \u201csurvivors,\u201d and cites them as evidence that transgenderism isn\u2019t immutable and thus doesn\u2019t warrant radical medical intervention. (She considers gender-reassignment surgery a form of mutilation.) \u201cThe phenomenon of regret undermines the idea that there exists a particular kind of person who is genuinely and essentially transgender and can be identified accurately by psychiatrists,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is radically destabilising to the transgender project.\u201d She cites as further evidence the case of Bradley Cooper, who, in 2011, at the age of seventeen, became Britain\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film 'Kiss and Tell'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1061}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Throughout the book, Jeffreys insists on using male pronouns to refer to trans women and female ones to refer to trans men. \u201cUse by men of feminine pronouns conceals the masculine privilege bestowed upon them by virtue of having been placed in and brought up in the male sex caste,\u201d she writes. To her critics, the book becomes particularly hateful when she tries to account for the reality of trans people. Explaining female-to-male transition is fairly easy for her (and for other radical feminists): women seek to become men in order to raise their status in a sexist system. Heath Atom Russell, for example, is quoted as attributing her former desire to become a man to the absence of a \u201cproud woman loving culture.\u201d But, if that\u2019s true, why would men demote themselves to womanhood? For reasons of sexual fetishism, Jeffreys says. She substantiates her argument with the highly controversial theories of Ray Blanchard, a retired professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the related work of J. Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University. Contrary to widespread belief, Blanchard says, the majority of trans women in the West start off not as effeminate gay men but as straight or bisexual men, and they are initially motivated by erotic compulsion rather than by any conceived female identity. \u201cThe core is, it\u2019s really exciting for guys to imagine themselves with female breasts, or female breasts and a vulva,\u201d he told me. To describe the syndrome, Blanchard coined the term \u201cautogynephilia,\u201d meaning sexual arousal at the thought of oneself as female. Blanchard is far from a radical feminist. He believes that gender-reassignment surgery can relieve psychological suffering; he has even counselled people who undergo it. He also accepts the commonly held view that male brains differ from female brains in ways that affect behavior. Nevertheless, Jeffreys believes that the work of Blanchard and Bailey shows that when trans women ask to be accepted as women they\u2019re seeking to have an erotic fixation indulged. The last time a feminist of any standing published an attack on transgenderism as caustic as \u201cGender Hurts\u201d was in 1979, when Janice Raymond produced \u201cThe Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.\u201d Raymond was a lesbian ex-nun who became a doctoral student of the radical-feminist theologian Mary Daly, at Boston College. Inspired by the women\u2019s-health movement, Raymond framed much of \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d as a critique of a patriarchal medical and psychiatric establishment. Still, the book was frequently febrile, particularly with regard to lesbian trans women. \u201cAll transsexuals rape women\u2019s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves,\u201d Raymond wrote. \u201cHowever, the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist violates women\u2019s sexuality and spirit.\u201d It\u2019s a measure of how much perceptions have changed in the past thirty-five years that \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d received a respectful, even admiring hearing in the mainstream media, unlike \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d which has been largely ignored there. Reviewing \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d in the Times, the psychiatrist Thomas Szasz called it \u201cflawless.\u201d Raymond, he wrote, \u201chas rightly seized on transsexualism as an emblem of modern society\u2019s unremitting\u2014though increasingly concealed\u2014antifeminism.\u201d One of the women Raymond wrote about was Sandy Stone, a performance artist and academic who this fall will teach digital arts and new media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. When Raymond\u2019s book was published, Stone was a recording engineer at Olivia Records, a women\u2019s-music collective in Los Angeles. In the late sixties, after graduating from college, and while still living as a man, she had bluffed her way into a job at New York\u2019s famed Record Plant recording studio, where she worked with Jimi Hendrix and the Velvet Underground. (For a time, she slept in the studio basement, on a pile of Hendrix\u2019s capes.) She moved to the West Coast and transitioned in 1974. Olivia approached her soon afterward; experienced female recording engineers were hard to find. Stone became a member of the collective the next year and moved into a communal house that it rented, where she was the only trans woman among a dozen or so other lesbians.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Actresses of \"Kiss and Tell\" and their Government Positions\n\nevidence:  \u201cThe Transsexual Empire,\u201d her presence was a major source of controversy in lesbian-feminist circles, but Stone insists that it was Raymond who created the dissension. \u201cWhen the book came out, we were deluged with hate mail,\u201d Stone says. \u201cUp to that point, we were pretty much happy campers, making our music and doing our political work.\u201d Stone received death threats, but ultimately it was the threat of a boycott that drove her out of the collective. She eventually earned a doctorate in philosophy at Santa Cruz. In 1987, Stone wrote an essay, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto,\u201d which is widely seen as the founding text of transgender studies. It\u2019s still taught around the world; a second French edition is about to be published, and Stone has received a request to allow a Catalan translation. The last time that Janice Raymond wrote on transgender issues was in 1994, for a new introduction to \u201cThe Transsexual Empire.\u201d Since then, she has focussed on sex trafficking, and last August a Norwegian government agency invited her to Oslo to speak on a panel about prostitution legislation. When she arrived, however, an official informed her that she had been disinvited; a letter to the editor of a major Norwegian newspaper had accused her of transphobia. Raymond says that similar things have \u201chappened much more frequently within the last couple of years.\u201d The most dramatic change in the perception of transgenderism can be seen in academia. Particularly at liberal-arts colleges, students are now routinely asked which gender pronoun they would prefer to be addressed by: choices might include \u201cze,\u201d \u201cou,\u201d \u201chir,\u201d \u201cthey,\u201d or even \u201cit.\u201d A decade ago, no university offered a student health plan that covered gender-reassignment surgery. Today, dozens do, including Harvard, Brown, Duke, Yale, Stanford, and the schools in the University of California system. There are young transgender-critical radical feminists, like Heath Atom Russell and Rachel Ivey, aged twenty-four, who was one of the organizers of Radfems Respond, but they are the first to admit that they\u2019re a minority. \u201cIf I were to say in a typical women\u2019s-studies class today, \u2018Female people are oppressed on the basis of reproduction,\u2019 I would get called out,\u201d Ivey says. Other students, she adds, would ask, \u201cWhat about women who are male?\u201d That might be an exaggeration, but only a slight one. The members of the board of the New York Abortion Access Fund, an all-volunteer group that helps to pay for abortions for those who can\u2019t afford them, are mostly young women; Alison Turkos, the group\u2019s co-chair, is twenty-six. In May, they voted unanimously to stop using the word \u201cwomen\u201d when talking about people who get pregnant, so as not to exclude trans men. \u201cWe recognize that people who identify as men can become pregnant and seek abortions,\u201d the group\u2019s new Statement of Values says. A Change.org petition asks NARAL and Planned Parenthood to adopt similarly gender-inclusive language. It specifically criticizes the hashtag #StandWithTexasWomen, which ricocheted around Twitter during State Senator Wendy Davis\u2019s filibuster against an anti-abortion bill in her state, and the phrase \u201cTrust Women,\u201d which was the slogan of George Tiller, the doctor and abortion provider who was murdered in Wichita in 2009. To some younger activists, it seems obvious that anyone who objects to such changes is simply clinging to the privilege inherent in being cisgender, a word popularized in the nineteen-nineties to mean any person who is not transgender. Alison Turkos has heard complaints that the new language obscures the fact that cisgender women overwhelmingly bear the brunt of the current political attacks on reproductive rights. She replies, \u201cIt may not feel comfortable, but it\u2019s important to create a space for more people who are often denied space and visibility.\u201d Older feminists who have not yet adopted this way of thinking can find themselves experiencing ideological whiplash. Sara St. Martin Lynne, a forty-year-old filmmaker and video producer from Oakland, told me, \u201cWhen you come from a liberation, leftist background, you want to be on the right side of history,\u201d and the debate \u201ckind of puts you through your paces.\u201d Last year, she was asked to resign from the board of Bay Area Girls Rock Camp, a nonprofit that \u201cempowers girls through music,\u201d because of her involvement with the Michigan Womyn\u2019s Music Festival, which bills itself as an event for \u201cwomyn-born womyn\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film 'Kiss and Tell'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1037}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Michfest, as it\u2019s called, takes place every August, on six hundred and fifty acres of land in the woods east of Lake Michigan. Lisa Vogel founded it in 1976, when she was a nineteen-year-old Central Michigan University student, and she still runs it. The music, Vogel says, is only part of what makes Michfest important. Each year, several thousand women set up camp there and find themselves, for a week, living in a matriarchy. Meals are cooked in kitchen tents and eaten communally. There are workshops and classes. Some women don extravagant costumes; others wear nothing at all. There is free child care and a team to assist disabled women who ordinarily cannot go camping. Vogel describes the governing ethos as \u201cHow would a town look if we actually got to decide what was important?\u201d She told me, \u201cThere\u2019s something that I experience on the land when I walk at night without a flashlight in the woods and recognize that for that moment I feel completely safe. And there\u2019s nowhere else I can do that.\u201d She continued, \u201cIf, tomorrow, we said everyone is welcome, I\u2019m sure it would still be a really cool event, but that piece that allows women to let down their guard and feel that really deep sense of personal liberation would be different, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about.\u201d To transgender activists, Vogel\u2019s stance is laden with offensive assumptions: that trans women are different in an essential way from other women, and that they\u2019re dangerous. \u201cThe trope of trans women\u201d constituting \u201ca threat to women\u2019s spaces has been tossed around forever,\u201d Julia Serano told me. To her, it\u2019s akin to straight people refusing to share a locker room with gays or lesbians. Serano, forty-six, is a biologist by training who now spends most of her time writing and speaking on transgender issues and feminism; last year, she lectured at schools including Brown, Stanford, Smith, and Cornell. (Sheila Jeffreys attacks her in \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d using autobiographical details from Serano\u2019s first book, \u201cWhipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity\u201d (2007), to paint her as an autogynephile who seeks to \u201creinvent \u2018feminism\u2019 to fit his erotic interests.\u201d) In the summer of 2003, Serano joined about a hundred people at Camp Trans, a protest camp near the Michfest site, which has run intermittently since 1994. Serano said that relations with Michfest attendees were often unexpectedly cordial. A few years ago, though, Vogel says, some protesters committed acts of vandalism\u2014stealing electrical cables, cutting water pipes, keying cars in the parking lot, and spray-painting a six-foot penis, and the words \u201cReal Women Have Dicks,\u201d on the side of the main kitchen tent. Since then, as with the case of Olivia Records, the demonstrations have been supplanted by a boycott campaign. Last year, the Indigo Girls, longtime regulars at Michfest, announced that they wouldn\u2019t appear again until the event became trans-inclusive. This year, the scheduled headliners, Hunter Valentine, pulled out for the same reason. Performers who do appear face protests and boycotts of their own; the funk singer Shelley Nicole says that her band, blaKb\u00fcshe, was dropped from a show in Brooklyn because it is playing at Michfest next month. Before Sara St. Martin Lynne was asked to leave the Bay Area Girls Rock Camp board, she hadn\u2019t identified closely with radical feminism. Yet, as the campaign against Michfest\u2014and against radical feminism as a whole\u2014has grown, she\u2019s come to feel strongly about keeping the event \u201cwomyn-born-womyn.\u201d She said, \u201cThis moment where we\u2019re losing the ability to say the word \u2018woman\u2019 or to acknowledge the fact that being born female has lived consequences and meaning is kind of intense to me.\u201d One of the trans women who showed up at the Radfems Respond conference, a thirty-five-year-old software engineer from California, with a tiny nose stud and long brown hair, agrees. She understands why trans women are hurt by their exclusion from Michfest and other female-only events and facilities, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not really wanting to invade space. It\u2019s a deep-seated wanting to belong.\u201d But, she adds, \u201cif you\u2019re identifying with women, shouldn\u2019t you be empathizing with women?\u201d Sandy Stone shares this view\u2014up to a point.

Although it was CBS's answer to NBC's A Date with Judy, it was also broadcast by NBC in 1948 as a summer replacement for The Bob Hope Show. From October 3, 1952, to June 26, 1953, it aired on ABC, finally returning to CBS. Despite the program's long run, fewer than 24 episodes are known to exist. Priscilla Lyon and Janet Waldo successively portrayed 15-year-old Corliss on radio. Lugene Sanders also played Corliss briefly on radio and in the CBS version of the Meet Corliss Archer television show. Perpetually perky, breathless and well-intentioned, Corliss is constantly at the side of her next-door neighbor and boyfriend, Dexter Franklin (Bill Christy, Sam Edwards). Clumsy, nerdy Dexter, a sweet but constant bungler with a nasal voice, is best remembered for his trademark phrase, \"Holy cow!\" and his braying call, \"Heyyyy, Corrrrrliiiiiss!\"\u2014frequently delivered from the hedge separating their houses. Harry Archer, Corliss's father, is a lawyer who tolerates Dexter only when he wants to use him to help flaunt male superiority. Gruff but gentle, he was played by Bob Bailey, Fred Shields and Frank Martin. Janet Archer, Corliss's mother, was played by, successively, Irene Tedrow, Monty Margetts and Gloria Holden. She is calm and understanding with her daughter and her husband, both of whom sometimes try her patience. Other frequent characters include Mildred Ames, a good friend of Corliss (played by Bebe Young and Barbara Whiting); Mildred's irritating younger brother Raymond (Tommy Bernard, Kenny Godkin); and Corliss's rival, Betty Cameron (Delores Crane). Meet Corliss Archer was written by F. Hugh Herbert, who first introduced the character and her friends in a Good Housekeeping magazine story \"A Private Affair,\" the first of a series of stories. Kiss and Tell was a 1943 play that was adapted for a 1945 film starring Shirley Temple. The 1949 sequel, A Kiss for Corliss, was re-released in 1954. Herbert's Meet Corliss Archer property was adapted to television in 1951 and 1952 with live broadcasts produced and aired by CBS. In 1954 and 1955 Ziv Television Programs produced a syndicated telefilm series starring Ann Baker and Mary Brian. One of the show's unique features was the occasional cut to a comic-book-style drawing, with announcer's commentary, that illustrated the current story situation and was used several times during each episode. The program was produced by Ziv Productions. Several episodes of the Ziv version are available on DVD, and some are also available from the Internet Archive. Robin Morgan portrayed Corliss in a live telecast of Kiss and Tell on The Alcoa Hour (August 5, 1956), with Warren Berlinger as Dexter. Radio listeners had to use their imaginations to visualize Corliss, her friends and her town. But those imaginations got a boost in 1948 when the Meet Corliss Archer comic book, published by Fox Feature Syndicate, came out in three issues from March to July 1948. Al Feldstein (Albert B. Feldstein), later the editor of Mad, was a key writer and illustrator of this short-lived comic book series, which is now remembered primarily for his artwork in general and the good girl art covers in particular. Film strips and radio microphones on the front cover indicated the tie-ins and media crossovers. Janet Waldo was depicted on the front cover twice, as herself and as Corliss.\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the live telecast of 'Kiss and Tell' on The Alcoa Hour?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Robin Morgan", "usage": 915}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since the early 1960s, she has been a key radical feminist member of the American Women's Movement, and a leader in the international feminist movement. Her 1970 anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful was cited by the New York Public Library as \"One of the 100 Most Influential Books of the 20th Century.\". She has written more than 20 books of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, and was editor of Ms. magazine. During the 1960s, she participated in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements; in the late 1960s, she was a founding member of radical feminist organizations such as New York Radical Women and W.I.T.C.H. She founded or co-founded the Feminist Women's Health Network, the National Battered Women's Refuge Network, Media Women, the National Network of Rape Crisis Centers, the Feminist Writers' Guild, the Women's Foreign Policy Council, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, GlobalSister.org, and Greenstone Women's Radio Network. She also co-founded the Women's Media Center with activist Gloria Steinem and actor/activist Jane Fonda. In 2018, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women. Due to circumstances at her birth, her mother claimed that Robin Morgan was born a year later than she actually was (see birth and parents), and throughout her career as a child actor, she was thought to be a year younger than she actually was, both by herself and others. Already as a toddler, her mother, Faith, and mother's sister Sally started Robin as a child model. At the age of five, believed to be four, she got her own program, titled Little Robin Morgan, on the New York radio station WOR. She was also a regular on the original network radio version of Juvenile Jury. Her acting career took off when she was eight and started in the TV series Mama, as Dagmar Hansen, the younger sister in the family depicted in the series. The show premiered on CBS in 1949, starring Peggy Wood, and was a great success. Morgan played Cecchina Cabrini in Citizen Saint (1947). During the Golden Age of Television, Morgan starred in such \"TV spectaculars\" as Kiss and Tell and Alice in Wonderland, and guest starred on such live dramas as Omnibus, Suspense, Danger, Hallmark Hall of Fame, Robert Montgomery Presents, Tales of Tomorrow, and Kraft Theatre. She worked with directors such as Sidney Lumet, John Frankenheimer, Ralph Nelson; writers such as Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling; and performed with actors such as Boris Karloff, Rosalind Russell, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, and Cliff Robertson. Having wanted to write rather than to act since she was four, Morgan fought her mother's efforts to keep her in show business, and left the cast of Mama at age 14. As she entered adulthood, Robin Morgan continued her education as a non-matriculating student at Columbia University. She began working as a secretary at Curtis Brown Literary Agency, where she met and worked with such writers as poet W. H. Auden in the early 1960s. She had already begun publishing her own poetry (later collected in her first book of poems, Monster, published in 1972). Throughout the next decades, along with political activism, writing fiction and nonfiction prose, and lecturing at colleges and universities on women's rights, Morgan continued to write and publish poetry. In 1962, Morgan married poet Kenneth Pitchford. She gave birth to their son, Blake Morgan, in 1969. The couple divorced in 1983. At that time, she was working as an editor at Grove Press and was involved in an attempt to unionize the publishing industry. When Grove summarily fired her and other union sympathizers, she led a seizure and occupation of their offices in the spring of 1970, protesting the union-busting, as well as the dishonest accounting of royalties to Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow. Morgan and eight other women were arrested that day. In the mid-1970s Morgan became a Contributing Editor to Ms. magazine, and continued her affiliation there as a part- or full-time editor in the following decades. She served as editor-in-chief of the magazine from 1989 to 1994, turning it into a highly successful, ad-free, bimonthly, international publication, which won awards for both writing and design, and received considerable acclaim among journalists. In 1979, when the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed, featuring famous women from politics, media and entertainment, culture, sports, and other areas of achievement, one of the cards featured Morgan's name and picture. Today, the trading cards are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the University of Iowa library. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the live telecast of 'Kiss and Tell' on The Alcoa Hour?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1154}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Seven years later, in 2012, she debuted a weekly radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live With Robin Morgan. The broadcast is syndicated in the US and, as a podcast, is published online at the WMCLive website, and distributed on iTunes in 110 countries. It has been praised by The Huffington Post as \"talk radio with a brain\" and features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. The weekly hour was picked up by CBS Radio two weeks after its launch and is broadcast on CBS affiliate WJFK each Saturday. The program features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. By 1962 Morgan had become active in the anti-war Left, and had also contributed articles and poetry to such Left-wing and counter-culture journals as Liberation, Rat, Win, and The National Guardian. In the 1960s she became increasingly involved in social-justice movements, notably the civil-rights and anti-Vietnam war. In early 1967, she was active in the Youth International Party (known in the media as the \"Yippies\"), with Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner. However, tensions over sexism within the YIP (and the New Left in general) came to a head when Morgan grew more involved in Women's Liberation and contemporary feminism. In 1967, Morgan became a founding member of the short-lived New York Radical Women group. She was the key organizer of their September 1968 inaugural protest of the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City. Morgan wrote the Miss America protest pamphlet No More Miss America!, and that same year cofounded Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.), a radical feminist group that used public street theater (called \"hexes\" or \"zaps\") to call attention to sexism. Morgan designed the universal symbol of the women\u2019s movement\u2013\u2013the female symbol, a circle with a cross beneath, centered with a raised fist. The Oxford English Dictionary also credits her with first using the term \"herstory\" in print in her 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful. Concerning the feminist organization W.I.T.C.H., Morgan wrote: With the royalties from her anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful, Morgan founded the first feminist grant-giving foundation in the US: The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, which provided seed money to many early women's groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s. She made a decisive break from what she described as the \"male Left\" when she led the women's takeover of the underground newspaper Rat in 1970, and listed the reasons for her break in the first women's issue of the paper, in her essay titled \"Goodbye to All That\". The essay gained notoriety in the press for naming specific sexist men and institutions in the Left. Decades later, during the Democratic primaries for the 2008 presidential race, Morgan wrote a fiery sequel to her original essay, titled \"Goodbye To All That #2\", in defense of Hillary Clinton. The article quickly went viral on the internet for lambasting sexist rhetoric directed towards Clinton by the media. In 1977, Morgan became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Morgan has traveled extensively across the United States and around the world to bring attention to cross-cultural sexism. She has met with and interviewed female rebel fighters in the Philippines, Brazilian women activists in the slums/favelas of Rio, women organizers in the townships of South Africa, and underground feminists in Iran. Twice\u2013\u2013in 1986 and 1989 she spent months in the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, West Bank, and Gaza, to report on the conditions of women. Morgan has also spoken at universities and institutions in countries across Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America, as well as in Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. Over the years, Morgan has received numerous awards for her activism on women\u2019s rights. The Feminist Majority Foundation named Robin Morgan \"Woman of the Year\" in 1990; she received the Warrior Woman Award for Promoting Racial Understanding from The Asian American Women's National Organization in 1992; in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now, and in 2003 The Feminist Press gave her a \"Femmy\" Award for her \"service to literature\". She has also received the Humanist Heroine Award from The American Humanist Association in 2007. In March 2012 Morgan, along with her Women's Media Center co-founders Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem, wrote an open letter asking listeners to request\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the live telecast of 'Kiss and Tell' on The Alcoa Hour?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1153}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They asked that stations licensed for public airwaves carrying Limbaugh be held accountable for contravening public interest as a continual promoter of hate speech against various disempowered and minority groups. In 1970, Morgan compiled, edited, and introduced the first anthology of feminist writings, Sisterhood is Powerful. The compilation included now-classic feminist essays by such activists as Naomi Weisstein, Kate Millett, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Florynce Kennedy, Frances M. Beal, Joreen, Marge Piercy, Lucinda Cisler and Mary Daly, as well as historical documents including the N.O.W. Bill of Rights, excerpts from the SCUM Manifesto, the Redstockings Manifesto, historical documents from W.I.T.C.H., and a germinal statement from the Black Women\u2019s Liberation Group of Mount Vernon. It also included what Morgan called \"verbal karate\": useful quotes and statistics about women. The anthology was cited by the New York Public Library as one of the \u201cNew York Public Library's Books of the  Century\u201d. Morgan established the first American feminist grant-giving organization, The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, with the royalties from Sisterhood Is Powerful. However, the anthology was banned in Chile, China, and South Africa. Her follow-up volume in 1984, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology, compiled articles about women in over seventy countries. That same year she founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, notable for being the first international feminist think tank. Repeatedly refusing the post of president, she was elected secretary of the organization from 1989 to 1993, was VP from 1993 to 1997, and after serving on the advisory board, finally agreed to become president in 2004. A third volume, Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium in 2003, was a collection of articles mostly by well-known feminists, both young and \"vintage\", in a retrospective on and future blueprint for the feminist movement. It was compiled, edited, and with an introduction by Morgan, and Morgan wrote \"To Vintage Feminists\" and \"To Younger Women\", which were both included in the anthology as Personal Postscripts. Morgan's articles, essays, reviews, interviews, political analyses, and investigative journalism have appeared widely in such publications as The Atlantic, Broadsheet, Chrysalis, Essence, Everywoman, The Feminist Art Journal, The Guardian (US), The Guardian (UK), The Hudson Review, the Los Angeles Times, Ms., The New Republic, The New York Times, Off Our Backs, Pacific Ways, The Second Wave, Sojourner, The Village Voice, The Voice of Women, and various United Nations periodicals, etc. Articles and essays have also appeared in reprint in international media, in English across the Commonwealth, and in translation in 13 languages in Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. Morgan has served as a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for many years, receiving the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism for her cover story titled \"The First Feminist Exiles from the USSR\" in 1981. She served as the magazine's editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, re-launching it as an ad-free, international bimonthly publication in 1991. This earned her a series of awards, including the award for Editorial Excellence by Utne Reader in 1991, and the Exceptional Merit in Journalism Award by the National Women's Political Caucus. Morgan resigned her post in 1994 to become Consulting Global Editor of the magazine, which she remains to this day. Morgan has written for online audiences and blogged frequently. Among her best known articles are \"Letters from Ground Zero\" (written and posted after the September 11 attacks in 2001 \u2014 which went viral), \"Goodbye To All That #2\", \"Women of the Arab Spring\", \"When Bad News is Good News: Notes of a Feminist News Junkie\", \"Manhood and Moral Waivers\", and \"Faith Healing: A Modest Proposal on Religious Fundamentalism\". Her online work is hosted in the archives of the Women's Media Center. Robin Morgan has published 21 books, including works of poetry, fiction, and the now-classic anthologies Sisterhood Is Powerful, Sisterhood Is Global, and Sisterhood Is Forever. Well before she was known as a feminist leader, literary magazines published her as a serious poet. According to a 1972 review of her first book of poems, Monster, in The Washington Post: \" establish Morgan as a poet of considerable means. There is a savage elegance, a richness of vocabulary, a thrust and steely polish..... A powerful, challenging book.\" In 1979 Morgan received a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in poetry,\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the live telecast of 'Kiss and Tell' on The Alcoa Hour?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1155}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

During this time she worked on a cycle of verse plays. Morgan\u2019s poetry collections include A Hot January: Poems 1996\u20131999 (W. W. Norton, 1999), Depth Perception: New Poems and a Masque (Doubleday, 1994), Upstairs in the Garden: Poems Selected and New 1968\u20131988 (W. W. Norton, 1990), Death Benefits (Copper Canyon Press, 1981), Lady of the Beasts (Random House, 1976), and Monster (Random House, 1972). Of the book A Hot January, Alice Walker wrote: \"Morgan proves that exquisite poetry can be the most surprising gift of grief. A volume as proud, fierce, vulnerable, and brave as the poet herself.\" A review of Upstairs in the Garden, noted: \"As a vindication and celebration of the female experience, these inventive poems successfully wed feminist rhetoric with vivid imagery and sensitivity to the music of language.\" Two books of poems, Lady of the Beasts and Depth Perception, earned reviews in Poetry Magazine with critic Jay Parini stating that \"Robin Morgan will soon be regarded as one of our first-ranking poets.\" Morgan had published three books of fiction as of 2015. Her debut novel was the semi-autobiographical Dry Your Smile (published by Doubleday & Company, 1987), followed by The Mer-Child: A Legend for Children and Other Adults (published by The Feminist Press at City University of New York, 1991). Her most recent work of fiction is a historical novel titled The Burning Time (Melville House Books, 2006), set in the 14th century, based on court records of the first witchcraft trial in Ireland. The Burning Time was placed on the Recommended Quality Fiction List of 2007 by the American Library Association, in addition to being the 2006 Paperback Pick by Book Sense (The American Booksellers Association). Morgan has compiled, edited, and introduced several influential anthologies: Sisterhood Is Powerful: The Women\u2019s Liberation Anthology (1970), Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), and Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003). She has herself written non-fiction, including Going Too Far (1978), The Anatomy of Freedom (1984), The Demon Lover: On the Sexuality of Terrorism (1989), The Word of a Woman (1994), and Saturday\u2019s Child: A Memoir (2001). One of the most widely translated of Morgan\u2019s books and a best-seller, The Demon Lover is a commentary on the psychological and political roots of terrorism, and New York Times Book Review called it \"Important...compelling.... is intense and at times magnificent.\" Her most recently published book of non-fiction is Fighting Words: A Tool Kit for Combating the Religious Right (2006). In 1984, Morgan, together with the late Simone de Beauvoir of France, and women from 80 other countries, founded The Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI), an international non-profit NGO with consultative status to the United Nations, which has for three decades functioned as the world\u2019s first feminist think-tank. The Institute has played a leading policy-formulation, strategic, and activist role in the evolution of the international Women\u2019s Movement. SIGI has also developed a global communications network through which an umbrella of NGO interest, advice, contacts, and support is collectively mobilized to empower the global women\u2019s movement. Among its many activities, the Institute pioneered the first Urgent Acton Alerts regarding women\u2019s rights; the first Global Campaign To Make Visible Women\u2019s Unpaid Labor In National Accounts; and the first Women\u2019s Rights Manuals For Muslim Societies (in 12 languages). Its most recent project is Donor Direct Action (donordirectaction.org), which links front-line women\u2019s rights activists around the world to money, visibility, and popular support: minimum bureaucracy, maximum impact. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit progressive organization, The Women\u2019s Media Center with her friends actor/activist Jane Fonda, and activist Gloria Steinem. The focus of the organization is to make women powerful and visible in the media. An invited speaker at numerous universities in North America, Morgan has traveled\u2014as organizer, speaker, journalist\u2014across North America, Europe, and the Middle East to Australia, Brazil, the Caribbean, Central America, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. She has also been a guest professor or scholar in residence at a variety of academic institutions. She was guest chair for feminist studies at the New College of Florida in 1971; a visiting professor at The Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture at Rutgers University in 1987; a distinguished visiting scholar in residence for literary and cultural studies at the University of Canterbury, Christ\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the live telecast of 'Kiss and Tell' on The Alcoa Hour?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1138}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She was awarded an honorary degree as a Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs in 1992. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection that documents the personal, political, and professional aspects of Morgan's life, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. They date from the 1940s to the present. Robin Morgan has been arrested, and has received death threats from both the Right and the Left because of her activism. According to a New Yorker magazine article published in the aftermath of Morgan's essay \"Goodbye to All That\" (#2) going viral on the Internet, \"At five feet tall Morgan is, not for the first time, the little woman who has started a big war.\" In her original essay, \"Goodbye to All That\" (1970), Morgan bade adieu to \"the dream that being in the leadership collective will get you anything but gonorrhea,\" referring to the \"male Left\". She also asserted that Charles Manson was \"only the logical extreme of the normal American male\u2019s fantasy.\" Two years later, Morgan published the poem \"Arraignment\", in which she openly accused Ted Hughes of the battery and murder of Sylvia Plath. There were lawsuits, Morgan's 1972 book Monster which contained that poem was banned, and underground, pirated feminist editions of it were published. As the leading organizer of the 1968 protest of the Miss America Pageant, \"No More Miss America!\", Morgan attacked the pageant\u2019s \"ludicrous 'beauty' standards and also accused the pageant of being racist, since at that time no African American woman had been a contestant. In addition\u2013\u2013according to Morgan\u2013\u2013in sending pageant winners to entertain troops in Vietnam, the women served as \"death mascots\" in an immoral war. Morgan asked, \"Where else could one find such a perfect combination of American values -- racism, militarism, capitalism -- all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol, a woman.\" Another controversial quote is from her 1978 book, Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist, where she stated: \"I feel that \"man-hating\" is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.\" Morgan famously walked off The Tonight Show in 1969 when it screened vintage footage of her as a child actor while she was trying to speak seriously about the first national march against rape. Of the incident, she has been quoted as saying: \"Imagine talking about such a subject and having it trivialized like that.\" In 1974, with her phrase \"Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice\" (from her essay \"Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape\"), she became a central figure on one of the divisive issues in feminism, particularly among anti-pornography feminists in Anglophone countries. In 1973, Robin Morgan gave the keynote speech at the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in which she criticized Beth Elliott, a performer and organizer of the conference, for being a transgender woman. In this speech she referred to Elliott as a \"transsexual male\" and used male pronouns throughout, charging her with being \"an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer-with the mentality of a rapist.\" At the end of her speech she called for a vote on ejecting Elliott, with over two-thirds voting to allow her to remain, however the minority threatened to disrupt the conference and Elliott chose to leave after her performance to avoid this. The event demonstrated the high tension surrounding transgender women's involvement in the women's movement of the 1970s. Robin Morgan grew up in New York, first in Mount Vernon, and later in Manhattan, on Sutton Place. She graduated from The Wetter School in Mount Vernon, in 1956, and was privately tutored from then until 1959. She published her first serious poetry in literary magazines at age 17. In an article published in the Jewish Women's Archive, Morgan reveals she is of Jewish ancestry, but identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She is quoted as saying, \"When compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Ashkenazic (with a touch of Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\" Morgan continues to tackle topics such as religion, politics and sex in fiery commentaries on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan.

In 2000 Norton published Morgan\u2019s memoir, Saturday's Child, in which she wrote candidly about \"the shadowy circumstances of her birth; a lifelong, impassioned, love-hate relationship with her mother; her years as a famous child actor and her fight to escape show business to become a serious writer; her marriage to a fiery bisexual poet and how motherhood transformed her life; her years in the civil rights movement, the New Left, and counterculture; her emergence a leader of global feminism; and her love affairs with women as well as men,\" according to BookNews.com. In her book, \"her passion for writing, especially poetry, is vividly conveyed, as is her love and respect for her son, born in 1969,\" according to The New York Times Book Review. In April 2013, Morgan announced publicly that she had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, discussing the diagnosis on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan, revealing that she had been diagnosed in 2010, but that her quality of life was thus far \"normal\". Since her diagnosis, Morgan has become active with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation (PDF), completing training to become part of the organization's Parkinson's Advocates in Research initiative. In 2014 she was the catalyst and took a leadership role in PDF's new Women and PD initiative, which will seek to better serve women impacted by Parkinson's disease by understanding and resolving gender inequalities in PD research, treatment, and caregiver support. Morgan has also written new poetry inspired by her battle with the disease, and performed a reading of some of the poems as a TED Talk, at the TEDWomen 2015 conference. Her mother, Faith Berkeley Morgan, traveled from her New York residence to Florida to give birth, in order to avoid public scrutiny for her unmarried status. Robin's father, a medical doctor named Mates Morgenstern, did not accompany pregnant Faith on her trip. Until Morgan was 13 years old, her mother Faith claimed that Robin's father had been killed in World War II. However, Robin overheard conversations between her mother and aunt suggesting her father was alive. When she confronted her mother, Faith changed her story to assert that Robin's father had escaped from one Nazi concentration camp after another, and that she had saved his life by sponsoring his immigration to the United States where he had no family. Not until several years later did Robin get proof that this was also a lie. Morgan learned the truth, both about her father, who was still alive, and how old she really was, early in 1961. Now a young woman, no longer working in show business, Robin found a listing for the medical practice of an obstetrician, Dr. Mates Morgenstern, in the New Brunswick, New Jersey telephone directory. Suspecting this might be her father, she had sought a meeting with him, without her mother's knowledge, and ultimately paid a surprise visit to his New Jersey office in January 1961. Morgenstern revealed that he was aware of Robin's fame as a child actor, but had remained firm in his decision to avoid contact with Faith Morgan, having chosen not to see her again after the only time he visited her and the infant Robin. He also told Robin, during their conversation in his medical office, that she in fact was born on January 29, 1941, exactly one year earlier than she thought, and disclosed the copy of her original birth certificate, that he had stored in his office. In order to conceal the out-of-wedlock birth, Faith Morgan had asked her Florida obstetrician to sign an affidavit stating that the birth took place on January 29, 1942. During the conversation in his office, Morgenstern told his daughter that he first met her mother after his arrival in the United States, more than a year before the United States entered World War II, and that she had had nothing to do with his immigration. He added that he had known Faith only briefly and claimed that she had fantasized their relationship as more important than it was. By the time Morgan met her father he had married and had two sons with a woman he had known since they were both children in Austria. Having been separated by the war, they resumed their relationship after she arrived in the United States not long after Robin was born, which probably also added to Morgenstern's decision to abandon Faith and their daughter. Morgan only met her father once more, in February 1965 when he invited her and her husband to his New Jersey home. Morgenstern did not want his sons to know that they had a half-sister and Morgan acceded to his request that they tell his two sons that she was \"the daughter of an old friend.\" She refused to do so again, however, and never met him or her two half-brothers again. Morgan describes the two encounters that she had with her biological father in her autobiography, Saturday's Child: A Memoir.

Hugh Herbert. Kiss and Tell starred Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer and Judith Parrish as her friend Mildred Pringle. The play's great success led to offers from Hollywood for Caulfield, who left the production almost one year to the day from when it opened, and was replaced in her role by her sister Betty Caulfield. Kiss and Tell premiered at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston on March 1, 1943 for tryout performances before its Broadway run. It opened in New York City on March 17, 1943 at the Biltmore Theatre. It remained there until the end of 1944, before transferring to the Bijou Theatre in 1945. It ran for a total of 956 performances before closing on June 23, 1945. The original production was produced by George Abbott and written by F. Hugh Herbert. The cast included Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer, Jessie Royce Landis as Janet Archer, Frances Bavier as Louise, Walter Davis as Uncle George, John Harvey as Private Earhart, Lulu Mae Hubbard as Dorothy Pringle, Robert Keith as Harry Archer, James Lane as Mr. Willard, Tommy Lewis as Raymond Pringle, Robert Lynn as Robert Pringle, Judith Parrish as Mildred Pringle, Calvin Thomas as Bill Franklin, Paula Trueman as Mary Franklin, Robert White as Dexter Franklin, and Richard Widmark as Lieut. Lenny Archer. Two teenage girls become interested in boys, and the girls' parents are making more problems rather than solving them. A film version written by Herbert and based on his play was released by Columbia Pictures on October 4, 1945 with Shirley Temple in the role of Corliss Archer. The film was directed by Richard Wallace and produced by Sol C. Siegel. Temple would reprise the role in the film's sequel A Kiss for Corliss in 1949.\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the live telecast of 'Kiss and Tell' on The Alcoa Hour?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 508}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In 1962 she became active in the civil rights and feminist movements, quickly becoming a leader. She worked as a contributing editor for Ms. Magazine for twenty years, serving as editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994. Her editing of the Sisterhood anthologies (beginning with Sisterhood Is Powerful in 1970) has a significant impact on the feminist movement. In 1984 Morgan founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, a think tank for women\u2019s rights worldwide. Morgan continues to write and lecture around the world in addition to hosting a weekly radio and online podcast and webcast program entitled \u201cWomen\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan.\u201d \u201cIf I had to name a single quality characteristic of patriarchy, it would be compartmentalization, the capacity for institutionalizing disconnection. Intellect severed from emotion. Thought separated from action. Science split from art. The earth itself divided\u2014national borders.... The personal isolated from the political. Sex divorced from love\u2026Law detached from justice\u2026If I had to name a single quality characteristic of global feminism, it would be connectivity\u2014a capacity dangerous to every status quo, because of its insistence on noticing.\u201d In her lifetime battle for women\u2019s dignity and global change, Robin Morgan uses words as ammunition, as one can see in the above quotation from The Word of a Woman (1992). As poet, novelist, journalist, lecturer, and feminist theorist, she expresses the reality of contemporary women\u2019s oppression. Morgan was born on January 29, 1941, daughter of Faith Berkeley Morgan, in Lake Worth, Florida. As a child, Morgan\u2019s mother told her that her father had been killed in World War II and later told her other false stories about his identity and fate. Morgan learned the true identity of her father, an obstetrician/gynecologist named Mates Morgenstern, in 1961 when she was nineteen years old. They met only once in person in 1965. When Morgan was not yet a year old, her mother entered her in baby contests and she began a career first as a child model, and later as a child actor and radio personality. She remained a public figure, starring in primetime dramas and specials as well as working on the stage, until the age of fourteen, when she left the limelight to do what she really wanted: to write. Though she never formally enrolled in college, Morgan attended (nonmatriculated) classes and lectures at Columbia University and remained in New York City. At the age of seventeen, she published her first serious poetry in a literary magazine. In 1962, Morgan married writer Kenneth Pitchford, whom she divorced in 1990. Together they had one son, Blake Morgan-Pitchford, born in 1969. Morgan identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She writes: \u201cWhen compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Jews of European origin and their descendants, including most of North and South American Jewry.Ashkenazic (with a touch of Descendants of the Jews who lived in Spain and Portugal before the explusion of 1492; primarily Jews of N. Africa, Italy, the Middle East and the Balkans.Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. And I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\u201d Morgan became an activist during the 1960s and was involved in the civil rights movement, SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee), and the anti-Vietnam War movement. She was also a founding member of New York Radical Women and other radical feminist organizations, such as W.I.T.C.H, which she co-founded in 1968. She was one of the key organizers of the 1968 protest at Atlantic City\u2019s Miss America Contest, which helped launch the second wave of United States feminism. She later reflected on the Miss America pageant, its practices, and the 1968 protest: \u201cwhere else could one find such a perfect combination of American values\u2014racism, militarism, capitalism\u2014all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol: a woman\u201d (Word of a Woman: Feminist Dispatches, 1968-1992). In the following decades, Morgan spearheaded the international women\u2019s liberation movement through her continued activism, her steadfast publishing of feminist poetry and prose, her work as a feminist journalist and editor, and her passionate international lecturing. Morgan coined the term \u201cherstory\u201d in her first published anthology, Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the live telecast of 'Kiss and Tell' on The Alcoa Hour?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1127}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Morgan also funded The Sisterhood is Powerful Fund, the first feminist foundation in the United States, with royalties from Sisterhood is Powerful. In 1970, Morgan helped lead the women\u2019s takeover of Rat, a leftist newspaper. Women staffers at the paper and previous contributors like Morgan seized the paper for an issue and never gave it back. In the first women\u2019s issue of the paper, titled \u201cWomen Seize RAT! Sabotage Tales!,\u201d Morgan published what became the famous essay, \u201cGoodbye to All That,\u201d in which she addressed sexism on the Left and \u201cLeftist men\u2019s betrayal of women.\u201d Throughout her career, Morgan has traveled far and wide to interview women rebel fighters in the Philippines, Palestinian women activists in the Intifada, and women in postrevolutionary Iran. She was a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for twenty years, serving as its editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, when it was relaunched as an advertisement-free publication. Since August 2012, Morgan has hosted a nationally syndicated weekly American radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan, in which she discusses current events, interviews guests, produces in-depth investigative reports, and offers commentary on a host of contemporary issues. Morgan has written more than twenty books, including five books of poetry, two novels, and numerous books of essays. She is best known as editor of several important anthologies. Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings from the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement (1970) gives voice to American feminists of the 1960s. These raw and immediate essays cover topics such as female orgasm, the nature of prostitution, the lives of radical lesbians, and the challenge of being Black and female. Morgan\u2019s second groundbreaking edited volume, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), compiles articles about the status of women in seventy countries. In 1984 Morgan co-founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI) with Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986), bringing together the writers of the anthology at an organizing conference. SIGI functions as a think-tank on women\u2019s human rights worldwide. Morgan is also co-founder of The Women\u2019s Media Center with Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem. A third anthology, Sisterhood is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003) was a well-received collection of articles by prominent feminists in which Morgan exhorted both young and the \u201cvintage\u201d feminists to take credit for the astounding and irreversible revolution they brought about. Morgan has since published several further works of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including Fighting Words: A Toolkit for Combating the Religious Right (2006) and a novel, Parallax, published in 2019. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection documenting aspects of Morgan\u2019s political history, personal life, and professional works, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. Morgan has received numerous awards, including the National Endowment for the Arts prize in poetry, the 1990 Feminist Majority Foundation Woman of the Year Award, and the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism. She has also been awarded grants from the Ford Foundation and received prizes for her editorial excellence. In 1992, Morgan was awarded an Honorary Degree as Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs, and in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now. Morgan was also awarded a \u201cFemmy\u201d award from the Feminist Press in 2003 for her \u201cservice to literature\u201d and in 2007 was awarded a Humanist Heroine Award by the American Humanist Association.

The conference had been convened by a group that wanted to defend two positions that have made radical feminism anathema to much of the left. First, the organizers hoped to refute charges that the desire to ban prostitution implies hostility toward prostitutes. Then they were going to try to explain why, at a time when transgender rights are ascendant, radical feminists insist on regarding transgender women as men, who should not be allowed to use women\u2019s facilities, such as public rest rooms, or to participate in events organized exclusively for women. The dispute began more than forty years ago, at the height of the second-wave feminist movement. In one early skirmish, in 1973, the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in Los Angeles, furiously split over a scheduled performance by the folksinger Beth Elliott, who is what was then called a transsexual. Robin Morgan, the keynote speaker, said: I will not call a male \u201cshe\u201d; thirty-two years of suffering in this androcentric society, and of surviving, have earned me the title \u201cwoman\u201d; one walk down the street by a male transvestite, five minutes of his being hassled (which he may enjoy), and then he dares, he dares to think he understands our pain? No, in our mothers\u2019 names and in our own, we must not call him sister. Such views are shared by few feminists now, but they still have a foothold among some self-described radical feminists, who have found themselves in an acrimonious battle with trans people and their allies. Trans women say that they are women because they feel female\u2014that, as some put it, they have women\u2019s brains in men\u2019s bodies. Radical feminists reject the notion of a \u201cfemale brain.\u201d They believe that if women think and act differently from men it\u2019s because society forces them to, requiring them to be sexually attractive, nurturing, and deferential. In the words of Lierre Keith, a speaker at Radfems Respond, femininity is \u201critualized submission.\u201d In this view, gender is less an identity than a caste position. Anyone born a man retains male privilege in society; even if he chooses to live as a woman\u2014and accept a correspondingly subordinate social position\u2014the fact that he has a choice means that he can never understand what being a woman is really like. By extension, when trans women demand to be accepted as women they are simply exercising another form of male entitlement. All this enrages trans women and their allies, who point to the discrimination that trans people endure; although radical feminism is far from achieving all its goals, women have won far more formal equality than trans people have. In most states, it\u2019s legal to fire someone for being transgender, and transgender people can\u2019t serve in the military. A recent survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force found overwhelming levels of anti-trans violence and persecution. Forty-one per cent of respondents said that they had attempted suicide. Yet, at the same time, the trans-rights movement is growing in power and cachet: a recent Time cover featuring the actress Laverne Cox was headlined \u201cTHE TRANSGENDER TIPPING POINT.\u201d The very word \u201ctransgender,\u201d which first came into wide use in the nineteen-nineties, encompasses far more people than the term \u201ctranssexual\u201d did. It includes not just the small number of people who seek gender-reassignment surgery\u2014according to frequently cited estimates, about one in thirty thousand men and one in a hundred thousand women\u2014but also those who take hormones, or who simply identify with the opposite gender, or, in some cases, with both or with neither. (According to the National Center survey, most trans women have taken female hormones, but only about a quarter of them have had genital surgery.) The elasticity of the term \u201ctransgender\u201d has forced a rethinking of what sex and gender mean; at least in progressive circles, what\u2019s determinative isn\u2019t people\u2019s chromosomes or their genitals or the way that they were brought up but how they see themselves. Having rejected this supposition, radical feminists now find themselves in a position that few would have imagined when the conflict began: shunned as reactionaries on the wrong side of a sexual-rights issue. It is, to them, a baffling political inversion. Radfems Respond was originally to have taken place across town from the library, at a Quaker meeting house, but trans activists had launched a petition on Change\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the live telecast of 'Kiss and Tell' on The Alcoa Hour?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1075}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They said that, in hosting it, the Quakers would alienate trans people and \u201cbe complicit in the violence against them.\u201d The Quakers, citing concerns in their community, revoked the agreement. It wasn\u2019t the first time that such an event had lost a scheduled venue. The Radfem 2012 conference was to be held in London, at Conway Hall, which bills itself as \u201ca hub for free speech and independent thought.\u201d But trans activists objected both to Radfem\u2019s women-only policy\u2014which was widely understood to exclude trans women\u2014and to the participation of Sheila Jeffreys, a professor of political science at the University of Melbourne. Jeffreys was scheduled to speak on prostitution, but she is a longtime critic of the transgender movement, and Conway Hall officials decided that they could not allow speakers who \u201cconflict with our ethos, principles, and culture.\u201d Ultimately, the event was held at a still secret location; organizers escorted delegates to it from a nearby meeting place. Radfem 2013 also had to switch locations, as did a gathering in Toronto last year, called Radfems Rise Up. In response, thirty-seven radical feminists, including major figures from the second wave, such as Ti-Grace Atkinson, Kathie Sarachild, and Michele Wallace, signed a statement titled \u201cForbidden Discourse: The Silencing of Feminist Criticism of \u2018Gender,\u2019 \u201d which described their \u201calarm\u201d at \u201cthreats and attacks, some of them physical, on individuals and organizations daring to challenge the currently fashionable concept of gender.\u201d With all this in mind, the Radfems Respond organizers had arranged the library space as a backup, but then a post on Portland Indymedia announced: We questioned the library administration about allowing a hate group who promotes discrimination and their response is that they cannot kick them out because of freedom of speech. So we also exercise our right to free speech in public space this Saturday to drive the TERFS and Radfems out of OUR library and OUR Portland! (TERF stands for \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminist.\u201d The term can be useful for making a distinction with radical feminists who do not share the same position, but those at whom it is directed consider it a slur.) Abusive posts proliferated on Twitter and, especially, Tumblr. One read, \u201c/kill/terfs 2K14.\u201d Another suggested, \u201chow about \u2018slowly and horrendously murder terfs in saw-like torture machines and contraptions\u2019 2K14.\u201d A young blogger holding a knife posted a selfie with the caption \u201cFetch me a terf.\u201d Such threats have become so common that radical-feminist Web sites have taken to cataloguing them. \u201cIt\u2019s aggrieved entitlement,\u201d Lierre Keith told me. \u201cThey are so angry that we will not see them as women.\u201d Keith is a writer and an activist who runs a small permaculture farm in Northern California. She is forty-nine, with cropped pewter hair and a uniform of black T-shirts and jeans. Three years ago, she co-founded the ecofeminist group Deep Green Resistance, which has some two hundred members and links the oppression of women to the pillaging of the planet. D.G.R. is defiantly militant, refusing to condemn the use of violence in the service of goals it considers just. In radical circles, though, what makes the group truly controversial is its stance on gender. As members see it, a person born with male privilege can no more shed it through surgery than a white person can claim an African-American identity simply by darkening his or her skin. Before D.G.R. held its first conference, in 2011, in Wisconsin, the group informed a person in the process of a male-to-female transition that she couldn\u2019t stay in the women\u2019s quarters. \u201cWe said, That\u2019s fine if you want to come, but, no, you\u2019re not going to have access to the women\u2019s sleeping spaces and the women\u2019s bathrooms,\u201d Keith told me. Last February, Keith was to be a keynote speaker at the Public Interest Environmental Law Conference, at the University of Oregon, in Eugene, but the student government voted to condemn her, and more than a thousand people signed a petition demanding that the address be cancelled. Amid threats of violence, six policemen escorted Keith to the lectern, though, in the end, the protest proved peaceful: some audience members walked out and held a rally, leaving her to speak to a half-empty room. Keith had an easier time at Radfems Respond, where she spoke on the differences between radicalism and liberalism.

A men\u2019s-rights activist showed up\u2014he later posted mocking clips from a video that he had secretly made\u2014but said nothing during the sessions. Several trans women arrived and sat at the back, but, in fact, they were there to express solidarity, having decided that the attacks on radical feminists were both out of control and misguided. One of them, a thin, forty-year-old blonde from the Bay Area, who blogs under the name Snowflake Especial, noted that all the violence against trans women that she\u2019s aware of was committed by men. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we dealing with them?\u201d she asked. Despite that surprising show of support, most of the speakers felt embattled. Heath Atom Russell gave the closing talk. A stocky woman, with curly turquoise hair and a bluish stubble shadow on her cheeks, she wore a T-shirt that read \u201cI Survived Testosterone Poisoning.\u201d At twenty-five, she is a \u201cdetransitioner,\u201d a person who once identified as transgender but no longer does. (Expert estimates of the number of transitioners who abandon their new gender range from fewer than one per cent to as many as five per cent.) Russell, a lesbian who grew up in a conservative Baptist family in Southern California, began transitioning to male as a student at Humboldt State University, and was embraced by gender-rights groups on campus. She started taking hormones and changed her name. Then, in her senior year, she discovered \u201cUnpacking Queer Politics\u201d (2003), by Sheila Jeffreys, which critiques female-to-male transsexualism as capitulation to misogyny. At first, the book infuriated Russell, but she couldn\u2019t let go of the questions that it raised about her own identity. She had been having heart palpitations, which made her uneasy about the hormones she was taking. Nor did she ever fully believe herself to be male. At one point during her transition, she hooked up with a middle-aged trans woman. Russell knew that she was supposed to think of herself as a man with a woman, but, she said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right, and I was scared.\u201d Eventually, she proclaimed herself a woman again, and a radical feminist, though it meant being ostracized by many of her friends. She is now engaged to a woman; someone keyed the word \u201cdyke\u201d on her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s car. Russell appears in Sheila Jeffreys\u2019s new book, \u201cGender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism.\u201d Jeffreys, who is sixty-six, has short silver hair and a weathered face. She has taught at the University of Melbourne for twenty-three years, but she grew up in London, and has been described as the Andrea Dworkin of the U.K. She has written nine previous books, all of which focus on the sexual subjugation of women, whether through rape, incest, pornography, prostitution, or Western beauty norms. Like Dworkin, she is viewed as a heroine by a cadre of like-minded admirers and as a zealot by others. In 2005, in an admiring feature in the Guardian, Julie Bindel wrote, \u201cJeffreys sees sexuality as the basis of the oppression of women by men, in much the same way as Marx saw capitalism as the scourge of the working class. This unwavering belief has made her many enemies. Postmodern theorist Judith Halberstam once said, \u2018If Sheila Jeffreys did not exist, Camille Paglia would have had to invent her.\u2019 \u201d In eight brisk chapters (half of them written with Jeffreys\u2019s former Ph.D. student Lorene Gottschalk), \u201cGender Hurts\u201d offers Jeffreys\u2019s first full-length treatment of transgenderism. Ordinarily, Jeffreys told me, she would launch the publication of a new book with an event at the university, but this time campus security warned against it. She has also taken her name off her office door. She gave a talk in London this month, but it was invitation-only. In the book, Jeffreys calls detransitioners like Russell \u201csurvivors,\u201d and cites them as evidence that transgenderism isn\u2019t immutable and thus doesn\u2019t warrant radical medical intervention. (She considers gender-reassignment surgery a form of mutilation.) \u201cThe phenomenon of regret undermines the idea that there exists a particular kind of person who is genuinely and essentially transgender and can be identified accurately by psychiatrists,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is radically destabilising to the transgender project.\u201d She cites as further evidence the case of Bradley Cooper, who, in 2011, at the age of seventeen, became Britain\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the live telecast of 'Kiss and Tell' on The Alcoa Hour?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1070}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Jeffreys is especially alarmed by doctors in Europe, Australia, and the United States who treat transgender children with puberty-delaying drugs, which prevent them from developing unwanted secondary sex characteristics and can result in sterilization. Throughout the book, Jeffreys insists on using male pronouns to refer to trans women and female ones to refer to trans men. \u201cUse by men of feminine pronouns conceals the masculine privilege bestowed upon them by virtue of having been placed in and brought up in the male sex caste,\u201d she writes. To her critics, the book becomes particularly hateful when she tries to account for the reality of trans people. Explaining female-to-male transition is fairly easy for her (and for other radical feminists): women seek to become men in order to raise their status in a sexist system. Heath Atom Russell, for example, is quoted as attributing her former desire to become a man to the absence of a \u201cproud woman loving culture.\u201d But, if that\u2019s true, why would men demote themselves to womanhood? For reasons of sexual fetishism, Jeffreys says. She substantiates her argument with the highly controversial theories of Ray Blanchard, a retired professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the related work of J. Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University. Contrary to widespread belief, Blanchard says, the majority of trans women in the West start off not as effeminate gay men but as straight or bisexual men, and they are initially motivated by erotic compulsion rather than by any conceived female identity. \u201cThe core is, it\u2019s really exciting for guys to imagine themselves with female breasts, or female breasts and a vulva,\u201d he told me. To describe the syndrome, Blanchard coined the term \u201cautogynephilia,\u201d meaning sexual arousal at the thought of oneself as female. Blanchard is far from a radical feminist. He believes that gender-reassignment surgery can relieve psychological suffering; he has even counselled people who undergo it. He also accepts the commonly held view that male brains differ from female brains in ways that affect behavior. Nevertheless, Jeffreys believes that the work of Blanchard and Bailey shows that when trans women ask to be accepted as women they\u2019re seeking to have an erotic fixation indulged. The last time a feminist of any standing published an attack on transgenderism as caustic as \u201cGender Hurts\u201d was in 1979, when Janice Raymond produced \u201cThe Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.\u201d Raymond was a lesbian ex-nun who became a doctoral student of the radical-feminist theologian Mary Daly, at Boston College. Inspired by the women\u2019s-health movement, Raymond framed much of \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d as a critique of a patriarchal medical and psychiatric establishment. Still, the book was frequently febrile, particularly with regard to lesbian trans women. \u201cAll transsexuals rape women\u2019s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves,\u201d Raymond wrote. \u201cHowever, the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist violates women\u2019s sexuality and spirit.\u201d It\u2019s a measure of how much perceptions have changed in the past thirty-five years that \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d received a respectful, even admiring hearing in the mainstream media, unlike \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d which has been largely ignored there. Reviewing \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d in the Times, the psychiatrist Thomas Szasz called it \u201cflawless.\u201d Raymond, he wrote, \u201chas rightly seized on transsexualism as an emblem of modern society\u2019s unremitting\u2014though increasingly concealed\u2014antifeminism.\u201d One of the women Raymond wrote about was Sandy Stone, a performance artist and academic who this fall will teach digital arts and new media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. When Raymond\u2019s book was published, Stone was a recording engineer at Olivia Records, a women\u2019s-music collective in Los Angeles. In the late sixties, after graduating from college, and while still living as a man, she had bluffed her way into a job at New York\u2019s famed Record Plant recording studio, where she worked with Jimi Hendrix and the Velvet Underground. (For a time, she slept in the studio basement, on a pile of Hendrix\u2019s capes.) She moved to the West Coast and transitioned in 1974. Olivia approached her soon afterward; experienced female recording engineers were hard to find. Stone became a member of the collective the next year and moved into a communal house that it rented, where she was the only trans woman among a dozen or so other lesbians. According to\n\nquestion: Who portrayed Corliss Archer in the live telecast of 'Kiss and Tell' on The Alcoa Hour?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1069}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She eventually earned a doctorate in philosophy at Santa Cruz. In 1987, Stone wrote an essay, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto,\u201d which is widely seen as the founding text of transgender studies. It\u2019s still taught around the world; a second French edition is about to be published, and Stone has received a request to allow a Catalan translation. The last time that Janice Raymond wrote on transgender issues was in 1994, for a new introduction to \u201cThe Transsexual Empire.\u201d Since then, she has focussed on sex trafficking, and last August a Norwegian government agency invited her to Oslo to speak on a panel about prostitution legislation. When she arrived, however, an official informed her that she had been disinvited; a letter to the editor of a major Norwegian newspaper had accused her of transphobia. Raymond says that similar things have \u201chappened much more frequently within the last couple of years.\u201d The most dramatic change in the perception of transgenderism can be seen in academia. Particularly at liberal-arts colleges, students are now routinely asked which gender pronoun they would prefer to be addressed by: choices might include \u201cze,\u201d \u201cou,\u201d \u201chir,\u201d \u201cthey,\u201d or even \u201cit.\u201d A decade ago, no university offered a student health plan that covered gender-reassignment surgery. Today, dozens do, including Harvard, Brown, Duke, Yale, Stanford, and the schools in the University of California system. There are young transgender-critical radical feminists, like Heath Atom Russell and Rachel Ivey, aged twenty-four, who was one of the organizers of Radfems Respond, but they are the first to admit that they\u2019re a minority. \u201cIf I were to say in a typical women\u2019s-studies class today, \u2018Female people are oppressed on the basis of reproduction,\u2019 I would get called out,\u201d Ivey says. Other students, she adds, would ask, \u201cWhat about women who are male?\u201d That might be an exaggeration, but only a slight one. The members of the board of the New York Abortion Access Fund, an all-volunteer group that helps to pay for abortions for those who can\u2019t afford them, are mostly young women; Alison Turkos, the group\u2019s co-chair, is twenty-six. In May, they voted unanimously to stop using the word \u201cwomen\u201d when talking about people who get pregnant, so as not to exclude trans men. \u201cWe recognize that people who identify as men can become pregnant and seek abortions,\u201d the group\u2019s new Statement of Values says. A Change.org petition asks NARAL and Planned Parenthood to adopt similarly gender-inclusive language. It specifically criticizes the hashtag #StandWithTexasWomen, which ricocheted around Twitter during State Senator Wendy Davis\u2019s filibuster against an anti-abortion bill in her state, and the phrase \u201cTrust Women,\u201d which was the slogan of George Tiller, the doctor and abortion provider who was murdered in Wichita in 2009. To some younger activists, it seems obvious that anyone who objects to such changes is simply clinging to the privilege inherent in being cisgender, a word popularized in the nineteen-nineties to mean any person who is not transgender. Alison Turkos has heard complaints that the new language obscures the fact that cisgender women overwhelmingly bear the brunt of the current political attacks on reproductive rights. She replies, \u201cIt may not feel comfortable, but it\u2019s important to create a space for more people who are often denied space and visibility.\u201d Older feminists who have not yet adopted this way of thinking can find themselves experiencing ideological whiplash.

Michfest, as it\u2019s called, takes place every August, on six hundred and fifty acres of land in the woods east of Lake Michigan. Lisa Vogel founded it in 1976, when she was a nineteen-year-old Central Michigan University student, and she still runs it. The music, Vogel says, is only part of what makes Michfest important. Each year, several thousand women set up camp there and find themselves, for a week, living in a matriarchy. Meals are cooked in kitchen tents and eaten communally. There are workshops and classes. Some women don extravagant costumes; others wear nothing at all. There is free child care and a team to assist disabled women who ordinarily cannot go camping. Vogel describes the governing ethos as \u201cHow would a town look if we actually got to decide what was important?\u201d She told me, \u201cThere\u2019s something that I experience on the land when I walk at night without a flashlight in the woods and recognize that for that moment I feel completely safe. And there\u2019s nowhere else I can do that.\u201d She continued, \u201cIf, tomorrow, we said everyone is welcome, I\u2019m sure it would still be a really cool event, but that piece that allows women to let down their guard and feel that really deep sense of personal liberation would be different, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about.\u201d To transgender activists, Vogel\u2019s stance is laden with offensive assumptions: that trans women are different in an essential way from other women, and that they\u2019re dangerous. \u201cThe trope of trans women\u201d constituting \u201ca threat to women\u2019s spaces has been tossed around forever,\u201d Julia Serano told me. To her, it\u2019s akin to straight people refusing to share a locker room with gays or lesbians. Serano, forty-six, is a biologist by training who now spends most of her time writing and speaking on transgender issues and feminism; last year, she lectured at schools including Brown, Stanford, Smith, and Cornell. (Sheila Jeffreys attacks her in \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d using autobiographical details from Serano\u2019s first book, \u201cWhipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity\u201d (2007), to paint her as an autogynephile who seeks to \u201creinvent \u2018feminism\u2019 to fit his erotic interests.\u201d) In the summer of 2003, Serano joined about a hundred people at Camp Trans, a protest camp near the Michfest site, which has run intermittently since 1994. Serano said that relations with Michfest attendees were often unexpectedly cordial. A few years ago, though, Vogel says, some protesters committed acts of vandalism\u2014stealing electrical cables, cutting water pipes, keying cars in the parking lot, and spray-painting a six-foot penis, and the words \u201cReal Women Have Dicks,\u201d on the side of the main kitchen tent. Since then, as with the case of Olivia Records, the demonstrations have been supplanted by a boycott campaign. Last year, the Indigo Girls, longtime regulars at Michfest, announced that they wouldn\u2019t appear again until the event became trans-inclusive. This year, the scheduled headliners, Hunter Valentine, pulled out for the same reason. Performers who do appear face protests and boycotts of their own; the funk singer Shelley Nicole says that her band, blaKb\u00fcshe, was dropped from a show in Brooklyn because it is playing at Michfest next month. Before Sara St. Martin Lynne was asked to leave the Bay Area Girls Rock Camp board, she hadn\u2019t identified closely with radical feminism. Yet, as the campaign against Michfest\u2014and against radical feminism as a whole\u2014has grown, she\u2019s come to feel strongly about keeping the event \u201cwomyn-born-womyn.\u201d She said, \u201cThis moment where we\u2019re losing the ability to say the word \u2018woman\u2019 or to acknowledge the fact that being born female has lived consequences and meaning is kind of intense to me.\u201d One of the trans women who showed up at the Radfems Respond conference, a thirty-five-year-old software engineer from California, with a tiny nose stud and long brown hair, agrees. She understands why trans women are hurt by their exclusion from Michfest and other female-only events and facilities, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not really wanting to invade space. It\u2019s a deep-seated wanting to belong.\u201d But, she adds, \u201cif you\u2019re identifying with women, shouldn\u2019t you be empathizing with women?\u201d Sandy Stone shares this view\u2014up to a point.

Although it was CBS's answer to NBC's A Date with Judy, it was also broadcast by NBC in 1948 as a summer replacement for The Bob Hope Show. From October 3, 1952, to June 26, 1953, it aired on ABC, finally returning to CBS. Despite the program's long run, fewer than 24 episodes are known to exist. Priscilla Lyon and Janet Waldo successively portrayed 15-year-old Corliss on radio. Lugene Sanders also played Corliss briefly on radio and in the CBS version of the Meet Corliss Archer television show. Perpetually perky, breathless and well-intentioned, Corliss is constantly at the side of her next-door neighbor and boyfriend, Dexter Franklin (Bill Christy, Sam Edwards). Clumsy, nerdy Dexter, a sweet but constant bungler with a nasal voice, is best remembered for his trademark phrase, \"Holy cow!\" and his braying call, \"Heyyyy, Corrrrrliiiiiss!\"\u2014frequently delivered from the hedge separating their houses. Harry Archer, Corliss's father, is a lawyer who tolerates Dexter only when he wants to use him to help flaunt male superiority. Gruff but gentle, he was played by Bob Bailey, Fred Shields and Frank Martin. Janet Archer, Corliss's mother, was played by, successively, Irene Tedrow, Monty Margetts and Gloria Holden. She is calm and understanding with her daughter and her husband, both of whom sometimes try her patience. Other frequent characters include Mildred Ames, a good friend of Corliss (played by Bebe Young and Barbara Whiting); Mildred's irritating younger brother Raymond (Tommy Bernard, Kenny Godkin); and Corliss's rival, Betty Cameron (Delores Crane). Meet Corliss Archer was written by F. Hugh Herbert, who first introduced the character and her friends in a Good Housekeeping magazine story \"A Private Affair,\" the first of a series of stories. Kiss and Tell was a 1943 play that was adapted for a 1945 film starring Shirley Temple. The 1949 sequel, A Kiss for Corliss, was re-released in 1954. Herbert's Meet Corliss Archer property was adapted to television in 1951 and 1952 with live broadcasts produced and aired by CBS. In 1954 and 1955 Ziv Television Programs produced a syndicated telefilm series starring Ann Baker and Mary Brian. One of the show's unique features was the occasional cut to a comic-book-style drawing, with announcer's commentary, that illustrated the current story situation and was used several times during each episode. The program was produced by Ziv Productions. Several episodes of the Ziv version are available on DVD, and some are also available from the Internet Archive. Robin Morgan portrayed Corliss in a live telecast of Kiss and Tell on The Alcoa Hour (August 5, 1956), with Warren Berlinger as Dexter. Radio listeners had to use their imaginations to visualize Corliss, her friends and her town. But those imaginations got a boost in 1948 when the Meet Corliss Archer comic book, published by Fox Feature Syndicate, came out in three issues from March to July 1948. Al Feldstein (Albert B. Feldstein), later the editor of Mad, was a key writer and illustrator of this short-lived comic book series, which is now remembered primarily for his artwork in general and the good girl art covers in particular. Film strips and radio microphones on the front cover indicated the tie-ins and media crossovers. Janet Waldo was depicted on the front cover twice, as herself and as Corliss.\n\nquestion: What government position did Shirley Temple hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 898}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since the early 1960s, she has been a key radical feminist member of the American Women's Movement, and a leader in the international feminist movement. Her 1970 anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful was cited by the New York Public Library as \"One of the 100 Most Influential Books of the 20th Century.\". She has written more than 20 books of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, and was editor of Ms. magazine. During the 1960s, she participated in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements; in the late 1960s, she was a founding member of radical feminist organizations such as New York Radical Women and W.I.T.C.H. She founded or co-founded the Feminist Women's Health Network, the National Battered Women's Refuge Network, Media Women, the National Network of Rape Crisis Centers, the Feminist Writers' Guild, the Women's Foreign Policy Council, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, GlobalSister.org, and Greenstone Women's Radio Network. She also co-founded the Women's Media Center with activist Gloria Steinem and actor/activist Jane Fonda. In 2018, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women. Due to circumstances at her birth, her mother claimed that Robin Morgan was born a year later than she actually was (see birth and parents), and throughout her career as a child actor, she was thought to be a year younger than she actually was, both by herself and others. Already as a toddler, her mother, Faith, and mother's sister Sally started Robin as a child model. At the age of five, believed to be four, she got her own program, titled Little Robin Morgan, on the New York radio station WOR. She was also a regular on the original network radio version of Juvenile Jury. Her acting career took off when she was eight and started in the TV series Mama, as Dagmar Hansen, the younger sister in the family depicted in the series. The show premiered on CBS in 1949, starring Peggy Wood, and was a great success. Morgan played Cecchina Cabrini in Citizen Saint (1947). During the Golden Age of Television, Morgan starred in such \"TV spectaculars\" as Kiss and Tell and Alice in Wonderland, and guest starred on such live dramas as Omnibus, Suspense, Danger, Hallmark Hall of Fame, Robert Montgomery Presents, Tales of Tomorrow, and Kraft Theatre. She worked with directors such as Sidney Lumet, John Frankenheimer, Ralph Nelson; writers such as Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling; and performed with actors such as Boris Karloff, Rosalind Russell, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, and Cliff Robertson. Having wanted to write rather than to act since she was four, Morgan fought her mother's efforts to keep her in show business, and left the cast of Mama at age 14. As she entered adulthood, Robin Morgan continued her education as a non-matriculating student at Columbia University. She began working as a secretary at Curtis Brown Literary Agency, where she met and worked with such writers as poet W. H. Auden in the early 1960s. She had already begun publishing her own poetry (later collected in her first book of poems, Monster, published in 1972). Throughout the next decades, along with political activism, writing fiction and nonfiction prose, and lecturing at colleges and universities on women's rights, Morgan continued to write and publish poetry. In 1962, Morgan married poet Kenneth Pitchford. She gave birth to their son, Blake Morgan, in 1969. The couple divorced in 1983. At that time, she was working as an editor at Grove Press and was involved in an attempt to unionize the publishing industry. When Grove summarily fired her and other union sympathizers, she led a seizure and occupation of their offices in the spring of 1970, protesting the union-busting, as well as the dishonest accounting of royalties to Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow. Morgan and eight other women were arrested that day. In the mid-1970s Morgan became a Contributing Editor to Ms. magazine, and continued her affiliation there as a part- or full-time editor in the following decades. She served as editor-in-chief of the magazine from 1989 to 1994, turning it into a highly successful, ad-free, bimonthly, international publication, which won awards for both writing and design, and received considerable acclaim among journalists. In 1979, when the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed, featuring famous women from politics, media and entertainment, culture, sports, and other areas of achievement, one of the cards featured Morgan's name and picture. Today, the trading cards are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the University of Iowa library. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit\n\nquestion: What government position did Shirley Temple hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1137}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Seven years later, in 2012, she debuted a weekly radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live With Robin Morgan. The broadcast is syndicated in the US and, as a podcast, is published online at the WMCLive website, and distributed on iTunes in 110 countries. It has been praised by The Huffington Post as \"talk radio with a brain\" and features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. The weekly hour was picked up by CBS Radio two weeks after its launch and is broadcast on CBS affiliate WJFK each Saturday. The program features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. By 1962 Morgan had become active in the anti-war Left, and had also contributed articles and poetry to such Left-wing and counter-culture journals as Liberation, Rat, Win, and The National Guardian. In the 1960s she became increasingly involved in social-justice movements, notably the civil-rights and anti-Vietnam war. In early 1967, she was active in the Youth International Party (known in the media as the \"Yippies\"), with Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner. However, tensions over sexism within the YIP (and the New Left in general) came to a head when Morgan grew more involved in Women's Liberation and contemporary feminism. In 1967, Morgan became a founding member of the short-lived New York Radical Women group. She was the key organizer of their September 1968 inaugural protest of the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City. Morgan wrote the Miss America protest pamphlet No More Miss America!, and that same year cofounded Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.), a radical feminist group that used public street theater (called \"hexes\" or \"zaps\") to call attention to sexism. Morgan designed the universal symbol of the women\u2019s movement\u2013\u2013the female symbol, a circle with a cross beneath, centered with a raised fist. The Oxford English Dictionary also credits her with first using the term \"herstory\" in print in her 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful. Concerning the feminist organization W.I.T.C.H., Morgan wrote: With the royalties from her anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful, Morgan founded the first feminist grant-giving foundation in the US: The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, which provided seed money to many early women's groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s. She made a decisive break from what she described as the \"male Left\" when she led the women's takeover of the underground newspaper Rat in 1970, and listed the reasons for her break in the first women's issue of the paper, in her essay titled \"Goodbye to All That\". The essay gained notoriety in the press for naming specific sexist men and institutions in the Left. Decades later, during the Democratic primaries for the 2008 presidential race, Morgan wrote a fiery sequel to her original essay, titled \"Goodbye To All That #2\", in defense of Hillary Clinton. The article quickly went viral on the internet for lambasting sexist rhetoric directed towards Clinton by the media. In 1977, Morgan became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Morgan has traveled extensively across the United States and around the world to bring attention to cross-cultural sexism. She has met with and interviewed female rebel fighters in the Philippines, Brazilian women activists in the slums/favelas of Rio, women organizers in the townships of South Africa, and underground feminists in Iran. Twice\u2013\u2013in 1986 and 1989 she spent months in the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, West Bank, and Gaza, to report on the conditions of women. Morgan has also spoken at universities and institutions in countries across Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America, as well as in Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. Over the years, Morgan has received numerous awards for her activism on women\u2019s rights. The Feminist Majority Foundation named Robin Morgan \"Woman of the Year\" in 1990; she received the Warrior Woman Award for Promoting Racial Understanding from The Asian American Women's National Organization in 1992; in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now, and in 2003 The Feminist Press gave her a \"Femmy\" Award for her \"service to literature\". She has also received the Humanist Heroine Award from The American Humanist Association in 2007. In March 2012 Morgan, along with her Women's Media Center co-founders Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem, wrote an open letter asking listeners to request\n\nquestion: What government position did Shirley Temple hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1136}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They asked that stations licensed for public airwaves carrying Limbaugh be held accountable for contravening public interest as a continual promoter of hate speech against various disempowered and minority groups. In 1970, Morgan compiled, edited, and introduced the first anthology of feminist writings, Sisterhood is Powerful. The compilation included now-classic feminist essays by such activists as Naomi Weisstein, Kate Millett, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Florynce Kennedy, Frances M. Beal, Joreen, Marge Piercy, Lucinda Cisler and Mary Daly, as well as historical documents including the N.O.W. Bill of Rights, excerpts from the SCUM Manifesto, the Redstockings Manifesto, historical documents from W.I.T.C.H., and a germinal statement from the Black Women\u2019s Liberation Group of Mount Vernon. It also included what Morgan called \"verbal karate\": useful quotes and statistics about women. The anthology was cited by the New York Public Library as one of the \u201cNew York Public Library's Books of the  Century\u201d. Morgan established the first American feminist grant-giving organization, The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, with the royalties from Sisterhood Is Powerful. However, the anthology was banned in Chile, China, and South Africa. Her follow-up volume in 1984, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology, compiled articles about women in over seventy countries. That same year she founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, notable for being the first international feminist think tank. Repeatedly refusing the post of president, she was elected secretary of the organization from 1989 to 1993, was VP from 1993 to 1997, and after serving on the advisory board, finally agreed to become president in 2004. A third volume, Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium in 2003, was a collection of articles mostly by well-known feminists, both young and \"vintage\", in a retrospective on and future blueprint for the feminist movement. It was compiled, edited, and with an introduction by Morgan, and Morgan wrote \"To Vintage Feminists\" and \"To Younger Women\", which were both included in the anthology as Personal Postscripts. Morgan's articles, essays, reviews, interviews, political analyses, and investigative journalism have appeared widely in such publications as The Atlantic, Broadsheet, Chrysalis, Essence, Everywoman, The Feminist Art Journal, The Guardian (US), The Guardian (UK), The Hudson Review, the Los Angeles Times, Ms., The New Republic, The New York Times, Off Our Backs, Pacific Ways, The Second Wave, Sojourner, The Village Voice, The Voice of Women, and various United Nations periodicals, etc. Articles and essays have also appeared in reprint in international media, in English across the Commonwealth, and in translation in 13 languages in Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. Morgan has served as a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for many years, receiving the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism for her cover story titled \"The First Feminist Exiles from the USSR\" in 1981. She served as the magazine's editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, re-launching it as an ad-free, international bimonthly publication in 1991. This earned her a series of awards, including the award for Editorial Excellence by Utne Reader in 1991, and the Exceptional Merit in Journalism Award by the National Women's Political Caucus. Morgan resigned her post in 1994 to become Consulting Global Editor of the magazine, which she remains to this day. Morgan has written for online audiences and blogged frequently. Among her best known articles are \"Letters from Ground Zero\" (written and posted after the September 11 attacks in 2001 \u2014 which went viral), \"Goodbye To All That #2\", \"Women of the Arab Spring\", \"When Bad News is Good News: Notes of a Feminist News Junkie\", \"Manhood and Moral Waivers\", and \"Faith Healing: A Modest Proposal on Religious Fundamentalism\". Her online work is hosted in the archives of the Women's Media Center. Robin Morgan has published 21 books, including works of poetry, fiction, and the now-classic anthologies Sisterhood Is Powerful, Sisterhood Is Global, and Sisterhood Is Forever. Well before she was known as a feminist leader, literary magazines published her as a serious poet. According to a 1972 review of her first book of poems, Monster, in The Washington Post: \" establish Morgan as a poet of considerable means. There is a savage elegance, a richness of vocabulary, a thrust and steely polish..... A powerful, challenging book.\" In 1979 Morgan received a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in poetry,\n\nquestion: What government position did Shirley Temple hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1138}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

During this time she worked on a cycle of verse plays. Morgan\u2019s poetry collections include A Hot January: Poems 1996\u20131999 (W. W. Norton, 1999), Depth Perception: New Poems and a Masque (Doubleday, 1994), Upstairs in the Garden: Poems Selected and New 1968\u20131988 (W. W. Norton, 1990), Death Benefits (Copper Canyon Press, 1981), Lady of the Beasts (Random House, 1976), and Monster (Random House, 1972). Of the book A Hot January, Alice Walker wrote: \"Morgan proves that exquisite poetry can be the most surprising gift of grief. A volume as proud, fierce, vulnerable, and brave as the poet herself.\" A review of Upstairs in the Garden, noted: \"As a vindication and celebration of the female experience, these inventive poems successfully wed feminist rhetoric with vivid imagery and sensitivity to the music of language.\" Two books of poems, Lady of the Beasts and Depth Perception, earned reviews in Poetry Magazine with critic Jay Parini stating that \"Robin Morgan will soon be regarded as one of our first-ranking poets.\" Morgan had published three books of fiction as of 2015. Her debut novel was the semi-autobiographical Dry Your Smile (published by Doubleday & Company, 1987), followed by The Mer-Child: A Legend for Children and Other Adults (published by The Feminist Press at City University of New York, 1991). Her most recent work of fiction is a historical novel titled The Burning Time (Melville House Books, 2006), set in the 14th century, based on court records of the first witchcraft trial in Ireland. The Burning Time was placed on the Recommended Quality Fiction List of 2007 by the American Library Association, in addition to being the 2006 Paperback Pick by Book Sense (The American Booksellers Association). Morgan has compiled, edited, and introduced several influential anthologies: Sisterhood Is Powerful: The Women\u2019s Liberation Anthology (1970), Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), and Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003). She has herself written non-fiction, including Going Too Far (1978), The Anatomy of Freedom (1984), The Demon Lover: On the Sexuality of Terrorism (1989), The Word of a Woman (1994), and Saturday\u2019s Child: A Memoir (2001). One of the most widely translated of Morgan\u2019s books and a best-seller, The Demon Lover is a commentary on the psychological and political roots of terrorism, and New York Times Book Review called it \"Important...compelling.... is intense and at times magnificent.\" Her most recently published book of non-fiction is Fighting Words: A Tool Kit for Combating the Religious Right (2006). In 1984, Morgan, together with the late Simone de Beauvoir of France, and women from 80 other countries, founded The Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI), an international non-profit NGO with consultative status to the United Nations, which has for three decades functioned as the world\u2019s first feminist think-tank. The Institute has played a leading policy-formulation, strategic, and activist role in the evolution of the international Women\u2019s Movement. SIGI has also developed a global communications network through which an umbrella of NGO interest, advice, contacts, and support is collectively mobilized to empower the global women\u2019s movement. Among its many activities, the Institute pioneered the first Urgent Acton Alerts regarding women\u2019s rights; the first Global Campaign To Make Visible Women\u2019s Unpaid Labor In National Accounts; and the first Women\u2019s Rights Manuals For Muslim Societies (in 12 languages). Its most recent project is Donor Direct Action (donordirectaction.org), which links front-line women\u2019s rights activists around the world to money, visibility, and popular support: minimum bureaucracy, maximum impact. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit progressive organization, The Women\u2019s Media Center with her friends actor/activist Jane Fonda, and activist Gloria Steinem. The focus of the organization is to make women powerful and visible in the media. An invited speaker at numerous universities in North America, Morgan has traveled\u2014as organizer, speaker, journalist\u2014across North America, Europe, and the Middle East to Australia, Brazil, the Caribbean, Central America, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. She has also been a guest professor or scholar in residence at a variety of academic institutions. She was guest chair for feminist studies at the New College of Florida in 1971; a visiting professor at The Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture at Rutgers University in 1987; a distinguished visiting scholar in residence for literary and cultural studies at the University of Canterbury, Christ\n\nquestion: What government position did Shirley Temple hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1121}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She was awarded an honorary degree as a Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs in 1992. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection that documents the personal, political, and professional aspects of Morgan's life, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. They date from the 1940s to the present. Robin Morgan has been arrested, and has received death threats from both the Right and the Left because of her activism. According to a New Yorker magazine article published in the aftermath of Morgan's essay \"Goodbye to All That\" (#2) going viral on the Internet, \"At five feet tall Morgan is, not for the first time, the little woman who has started a big war.\" In her original essay, \"Goodbye to All That\" (1970), Morgan bade adieu to \"the dream that being in the leadership collective will get you anything but gonorrhea,\" referring to the \"male Left\". She also asserted that Charles Manson was \"only the logical extreme of the normal American male\u2019s fantasy.\" Two years later, Morgan published the poem \"Arraignment\", in which she openly accused Ted Hughes of the battery and murder of Sylvia Plath. There were lawsuits, Morgan's 1972 book Monster which contained that poem was banned, and underground, pirated feminist editions of it were published. As the leading organizer of the 1968 protest of the Miss America Pageant, \"No More Miss America!\", Morgan attacked the pageant\u2019s \"ludicrous 'beauty' standards and also accused the pageant of being racist, since at that time no African American woman had been a contestant. In addition\u2013\u2013according to Morgan\u2013\u2013in sending pageant winners to entertain troops in Vietnam, the women served as \"death mascots\" in an immoral war. Morgan asked, \"Where else could one find such a perfect combination of American values -- racism, militarism, capitalism -- all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol, a woman.\" Another controversial quote is from her 1978 book, Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist, where she stated: \"I feel that \"man-hating\" is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.\" Morgan famously walked off The Tonight Show in 1969 when it screened vintage footage of her as a child actor while she was trying to speak seriously about the first national march against rape. Of the incident, she has been quoted as saying: \"Imagine talking about such a subject and having it trivialized like that.\" In 1974, with her phrase \"Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice\" (from her essay \"Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape\"), she became a central figure on one of the divisive issues in feminism, particularly among anti-pornography feminists in Anglophone countries. In 1973, Robin Morgan gave the keynote speech at the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in which she criticized Beth Elliott, a performer and organizer of the conference, for being a transgender woman. In this speech she referred to Elliott as a \"transsexual male\" and used male pronouns throughout, charging her with being \"an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer-with the mentality of a rapist.\" At the end of her speech she called for a vote on ejecting Elliott, with over two-thirds voting to allow her to remain, however the minority threatened to disrupt the conference and Elliott chose to leave after her performance to avoid this. The event demonstrated the high tension surrounding transgender women's involvement in the women's movement of the 1970s. Robin Morgan grew up in New York, first in Mount Vernon, and later in Manhattan, on Sutton Place. She graduated from The Wetter School in Mount Vernon, in 1956, and was privately tutored from then until 1959. She published her first serious poetry in literary magazines at age 17. In an article published in the Jewish Women's Archive, Morgan reveals she is of Jewish ancestry, but identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She is quoted as saying, \"When compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Ashkenazic (with a touch of Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\" Morgan continues to tackle topics such as religion, politics and sex in fiery commentaries on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan.

In 2000 Norton published Morgan\u2019s memoir, Saturday's Child, in which she wrote candidly about \"the shadowy circumstances of her birth; a lifelong, impassioned, love-hate relationship with her mother; her years as a famous child actor and her fight to escape show business to become a serious writer; her marriage to a fiery bisexual poet and how motherhood transformed her life; her years in the civil rights movement, the New Left, and counterculture; her emergence a leader of global feminism; and her love affairs with women as well as men,\" according to BookNews.com. In her book, \"her passion for writing, especially poetry, is vividly conveyed, as is her love and respect for her son, born in 1969,\" according to The New York Times Book Review. In April 2013, Morgan announced publicly that she had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, discussing the diagnosis on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan, revealing that she had been diagnosed in 2010, but that her quality of life was thus far \"normal\". Since her diagnosis, Morgan has become active with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation (PDF), completing training to become part of the organization's Parkinson's Advocates in Research initiative. In 2014 she was the catalyst and took a leadership role in PDF's new Women and PD initiative, which will seek to better serve women impacted by Parkinson's disease by understanding and resolving gender inequalities in PD research, treatment, and caregiver support. Morgan has also written new poetry inspired by her battle with the disease, and performed a reading of some of the poems as a TED Talk, at the TEDWomen 2015 conference. Her mother, Faith Berkeley Morgan, traveled from her New York residence to Florida to give birth, in order to avoid public scrutiny for her unmarried status. Robin's father, a medical doctor named Mates Morgenstern, did not accompany pregnant Faith on her trip. Until Morgan was 13 years old, her mother Faith claimed that Robin's father had been killed in World War II. However, Robin overheard conversations between her mother and aunt suggesting her father was alive. When she confronted her mother, Faith changed her story to assert that Robin's father had escaped from one Nazi concentration camp after another, and that she had saved his life by sponsoring his immigration to the United States where he had no family. Not until several years later did Robin get proof that this was also a lie. Morgan learned the truth, both about her father, who was still alive, and how old she really was, early in 1961. Now a young woman, no longer working in show business, Robin found a listing for the medical practice of an obstetrician, Dr. Mates Morgenstern, in the New Brunswick, New Jersey telephone directory. Suspecting this might be her father, she had sought a meeting with him, without her mother's knowledge, and ultimately paid a surprise visit to his New Jersey office in January 1961. Morgenstern revealed that he was aware of Robin's fame as a child actor, but had remained firm in his decision to avoid contact with Faith Morgan, having chosen not to see her again after the only time he visited her and the infant Robin. He also told Robin, during their conversation in his medical office, that she in fact was born on January 29, 1941, exactly one year earlier than she thought, and disclosed the copy of her original birth certificate, that he had stored in his office. In order to conceal the out-of-wedlock birth, Faith Morgan had asked her Florida obstetrician to sign an affidavit stating that the birth took place on January 29, 1942. During the conversation in his office, Morgenstern told his daughter that he first met her mother after his arrival in the United States, more than a year before the United States entered World War II, and that she had had nothing to do with his immigration. He added that he had known Faith only briefly and claimed that she had fantasized their relationship as more important than it was. By the time Morgan met her father he had married and had two sons with a woman he had known since they were both children in Austria. Having been separated by the war, they resumed their relationship after she arrived in the United States not long after Robin was born, which probably also added to Morgenstern's decision to abandon Faith and their daughter. Morgan only met her father once more, in February 1965 when he invited her and her husband to his New Jersey home. Morgenstern did not want his sons to know that they had a half-sister and Morgan acceded to his request that they tell his two sons that she was \"the daughter of an old friend.\" She refused to do so again, however, and never met him or her two half-brothers again. Morgan describes the two encounters that she had with her biological father in her autobiography, Saturday's Child: A Memoir.

Hugh Herbert. Kiss and Tell starred Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer and Judith Parrish as her friend Mildred Pringle. The play's great success led to offers from Hollywood for Caulfield, who left the production almost one year to the day from when it opened, and was replaced in her role by her sister Betty Caulfield. Kiss and Tell premiered at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston on March 1, 1943 for tryout performances before its Broadway run. It opened in New York City on March 17, 1943 at the Biltmore Theatre. It remained there until the end of 1944, before transferring to the Bijou Theatre in 1945. It ran for a total of 956 performances before closing on June 23, 1945. The original production was produced by George Abbott and written by F. Hugh Herbert. The cast included Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer, Jessie Royce Landis as Janet Archer, Frances Bavier as Louise, Walter Davis as Uncle George, John Harvey as Private Earhart, Lulu Mae Hubbard as Dorothy Pringle, Robert Keith as Harry Archer, James Lane as Mr. Willard, Tommy Lewis as Raymond Pringle, Robert Lynn as Robert Pringle, Judith Parrish as Mildred Pringle, Calvin Thomas as Bill Franklin, Paula Trueman as Mary Franklin, Robert White as Dexter Franklin, and Richard Widmark as Lieut. Lenny Archer. Two teenage girls become interested in boys, and the girls' parents are making more problems rather than solving them. A film version written by Herbert and based on his play was released by Columbia Pictures on October 4, 1945 with Shirley Temple in the role of Corliss Archer. The film was directed by Richard Wallace and produced by Sol C. Siegel. Temple would reprise the role in the film's sequel A Kiss for Corliss in 1949.\n\nquestion: What government position did Shirley Temple hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 491}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In 1962 she became active in the civil rights and feminist movements, quickly becoming a leader. She worked as a contributing editor for Ms. Magazine for twenty years, serving as editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994. Her editing of the Sisterhood anthologies (beginning with Sisterhood Is Powerful in 1970) has a significant impact on the feminist movement. In 1984 Morgan founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, a think tank for women\u2019s rights worldwide. Morgan continues to write and lecture around the world in addition to hosting a weekly radio and online podcast and webcast program entitled \u201cWomen\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan.\u201d \u201cIf I had to name a single quality characteristic of patriarchy, it would be compartmentalization, the capacity for institutionalizing disconnection. Intellect severed from emotion. Thought separated from action. Science split from art. The earth itself divided\u2014national borders.... The personal isolated from the political. Sex divorced from love\u2026Law detached from justice\u2026If I had to name a single quality characteristic of global feminism, it would be connectivity\u2014a capacity dangerous to every status quo, because of its insistence on noticing.\u201d In her lifetime battle for women\u2019s dignity and global change, Robin Morgan uses words as ammunition, as one can see in the above quotation from The Word of a Woman (1992). As poet, novelist, journalist, lecturer, and feminist theorist, she expresses the reality of contemporary women\u2019s oppression. Morgan was born on January 29, 1941, daughter of Faith Berkeley Morgan, in Lake Worth, Florida. As a child, Morgan\u2019s mother told her that her father had been killed in World War II and later told her other false stories about his identity and fate. Morgan learned the true identity of her father, an obstetrician/gynecologist named Mates Morgenstern, in 1961 when she was nineteen years old. They met only once in person in 1965. When Morgan was not yet a year old, her mother entered her in baby contests and she began a career first as a child model, and later as a child actor and radio personality. She remained a public figure, starring in primetime dramas and specials as well as working on the stage, until the age of fourteen, when she left the limelight to do what she really wanted: to write. Though she never formally enrolled in college, Morgan attended (nonmatriculated) classes and lectures at Columbia University and remained in New York City. At the age of seventeen, she published her first serious poetry in a literary magazine. In 1962, Morgan married writer Kenneth Pitchford, whom she divorced in 1990. Together they had one son, Blake Morgan-Pitchford, born in 1969. Morgan identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She writes: \u201cWhen compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Jews of European origin and their descendants, including most of North and South American Jewry.Ashkenazic (with a touch of Descendants of the Jews who lived in Spain and Portugal before the explusion of 1492; primarily Jews of N. Africa, Italy, the Middle East and the Balkans.Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. And I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\u201d Morgan became an activist during the 1960s and was involved in the civil rights movement, SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee), and the anti-Vietnam War movement. She was also a founding member of New York Radical Women and other radical feminist organizations, such as W.I.T.C.H, which she co-founded in 1968. She was one of the key organizers of the 1968 protest at Atlantic City\u2019s Miss America Contest, which helped launch the second wave of United States feminism. She later reflected on the Miss America pageant, its practices, and the 1968 protest: \u201cwhere else could one find such a perfect combination of American values\u2014racism, militarism, capitalism\u2014all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol: a woman\u201d (Word of a Woman: Feminist Dispatches, 1968-1992). In the following decades, Morgan spearheaded the international women\u2019s liberation movement through her continued activism, her steadfast publishing of feminist poetry and prose, her work as a feminist journalist and editor, and her passionate international lecturing. Morgan coined the term \u201cherstory\u201d in her first published anthology, Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of\n\nquestion: What government position did Shirley Temple hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1110}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Morgan also funded The Sisterhood is Powerful Fund, the first feminist foundation in the United States, with royalties from Sisterhood is Powerful. In 1970, Morgan helped lead the women\u2019s takeover of Rat, a leftist newspaper. Women staffers at the paper and previous contributors like Morgan seized the paper for an issue and never gave it back. In the first women\u2019s issue of the paper, titled \u201cWomen Seize RAT! Sabotage Tales!,\u201d Morgan published what became the famous essay, \u201cGoodbye to All That,\u201d in which she addressed sexism on the Left and \u201cLeftist men\u2019s betrayal of women.\u201d Throughout her career, Morgan has traveled far and wide to interview women rebel fighters in the Philippines, Palestinian women activists in the Intifada, and women in postrevolutionary Iran. She was a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for twenty years, serving as its editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, when it was relaunched as an advertisement-free publication. Since August 2012, Morgan has hosted a nationally syndicated weekly American radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan, in which she discusses current events, interviews guests, produces in-depth investigative reports, and offers commentary on a host of contemporary issues. Morgan has written more than twenty books, including five books of poetry, two novels, and numerous books of essays. She is best known as editor of several important anthologies. Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings from the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement (1970) gives voice to American feminists of the 1960s. These raw and immediate essays cover topics such as female orgasm, the nature of prostitution, the lives of radical lesbians, and the challenge of being Black and female. Morgan\u2019s second groundbreaking edited volume, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), compiles articles about the status of women in seventy countries. In 1984 Morgan co-founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI) with Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986), bringing together the writers of the anthology at an organizing conference. SIGI functions as a think-tank on women\u2019s human rights worldwide. Morgan is also co-founder of The Women\u2019s Media Center with Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem. A third anthology, Sisterhood is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003) was a well-received collection of articles by prominent feminists in which Morgan exhorted both young and the \u201cvintage\u201d feminists to take credit for the astounding and irreversible revolution they brought about. Morgan has since published several further works of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including Fighting Words: A Toolkit for Combating the Religious Right (2006) and a novel, Parallax, published in 2019. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection documenting aspects of Morgan\u2019s political history, personal life, and professional works, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. Morgan has received numerous awards, including the National Endowment for the Arts prize in poetry, the 1990 Feminist Majority Foundation Woman of the Year Award, and the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism. She has also been awarded grants from the Ford Foundation and received prizes for her editorial excellence. In 1992, Morgan was awarded an Honorary Degree as Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs, and in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now. Morgan was also awarded a \u201cFemmy\u201d award from the Feminist Press in 2003 for her \u201cservice to literature\u201d and in 2007 was awarded a Humanist Heroine Award by the American Humanist Association.

The conference had been convened by a group that wanted to defend two positions that have made radical feminism anathema to much of the left. First, the organizers hoped to refute charges that the desire to ban prostitution implies hostility toward prostitutes. Then they were going to try to explain why, at a time when transgender rights are ascendant, radical feminists insist on regarding transgender women as men, who should not be allowed to use women\u2019s facilities, such as public rest rooms, or to participate in events organized exclusively for women. The dispute began more than forty years ago, at the height of the second-wave feminist movement. In one early skirmish, in 1973, the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in Los Angeles, furiously split over a scheduled performance by the folksinger Beth Elliott, who is what was then called a transsexual. Robin Morgan, the keynote speaker, said: I will not call a male \u201cshe\u201d; thirty-two years of suffering in this androcentric society, and of surviving, have earned me the title \u201cwoman\u201d; one walk down the street by a male transvestite, five minutes of his being hassled (which he may enjoy), and then he dares, he dares to think he understands our pain? No, in our mothers\u2019 names and in our own, we must not call him sister. Such views are shared by few feminists now, but they still have a foothold among some self-described radical feminists, who have found themselves in an acrimonious battle with trans people and their allies. Trans women say that they are women because they feel female\u2014that, as some put it, they have women\u2019s brains in men\u2019s bodies. Radical feminists reject the notion of a \u201cfemale brain.\u201d They believe that if women think and act differently from men it\u2019s because society forces them to, requiring them to be sexually attractive, nurturing, and deferential. In the words of Lierre Keith, a speaker at Radfems Respond, femininity is \u201critualized submission.\u201d In this view, gender is less an identity than a caste position. Anyone born a man retains male privilege in society; even if he chooses to live as a woman\u2014and accept a correspondingly subordinate social position\u2014the fact that he has a choice means that he can never understand what being a woman is really like. By extension, when trans women demand to be accepted as women they are simply exercising another form of male entitlement. All this enrages trans women and their allies, who point to the discrimination that trans people endure; although radical feminism is far from achieving all its goals, women have won far more formal equality than trans people have. In most states, it\u2019s legal to fire someone for being transgender, and transgender people can\u2019t serve in the military. A recent survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force found overwhelming levels of anti-trans violence and persecution. Forty-one per cent of respondents said that they had attempted suicide. Yet, at the same time, the trans-rights movement is growing in power and cachet: a recent Time cover featuring the actress Laverne Cox was headlined \u201cTHE TRANSGENDER TIPPING POINT.\u201d The very word \u201ctransgender,\u201d which first came into wide use in the nineteen-nineties, encompasses far more people than the term \u201ctranssexual\u201d did. It includes not just the small number of people who seek gender-reassignment surgery\u2014according to frequently cited estimates, about one in thirty thousand men and one in a hundred thousand women\u2014but also those who take hormones, or who simply identify with the opposite gender, or, in some cases, with both or with neither. (According to the National Center survey, most trans women have taken female hormones, but only about a quarter of them have had genital surgery.) The elasticity of the term \u201ctransgender\u201d has forced a rethinking of what sex and gender mean; at least in progressive circles, what\u2019s determinative isn\u2019t people\u2019s chromosomes or their genitals or the way that they were brought up but how they see themselves. Having rejected this supposition, radical feminists now find themselves in a position that few would have imagined when the conflict began: shunned as reactionaries on the wrong side of a sexual-rights issue. It is, to them, a baffling political inversion.

They said that, in hosting it, the Quakers would alienate trans people and \u201cbe complicit in the violence against them.\u201d The Quakers, citing concerns in their community, revoked the agreement. It wasn\u2019t the first time that such an event had lost a scheduled venue. The Radfem 2012 conference was to be held in London, at Conway Hall, which bills itself as \u201ca hub for free speech and independent thought.\u201d But trans activists objected both to Radfem\u2019s women-only policy\u2014which was widely understood to exclude trans women\u2014and to the participation of Sheila Jeffreys, a professor of political science at the University of Melbourne. Jeffreys was scheduled to speak on prostitution, but she is a longtime critic of the transgender movement, and Conway Hall officials decided that they could not allow speakers who \u201cconflict with our ethos, principles, and culture.\u201d Ultimately, the event was held at a still secret location; organizers escorted delegates to it from a nearby meeting place. Radfem 2013 also had to switch locations, as did a gathering in Toronto last year, called Radfems Rise Up. In response, thirty-seven radical feminists, including major figures from the second wave, such as Ti-Grace Atkinson, Kathie Sarachild, and Michele Wallace, signed a statement titled \u201cForbidden Discourse: The Silencing of Feminist Criticism of \u2018Gender,\u2019 \u201d which described their \u201calarm\u201d at \u201cthreats and attacks, some of them physical, on individuals and organizations daring to challenge the currently fashionable concept of gender.\u201d With all this in mind, the Radfems Respond organizers had arranged the library space as a backup, but then a post on Portland Indymedia announced: We questioned the library administration about allowing a hate group who promotes discrimination and their response is that they cannot kick them out because of freedom of speech. So we also exercise our right to free speech in public space this Saturday to drive the TERFS and Radfems out of OUR library and OUR Portland! (TERF stands for \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminist.\u201d The term can be useful for making a distinction with radical feminists who do not share the same position, but those at whom it is directed consider it a slur.) Abusive posts proliferated on Twitter and, especially, Tumblr. One read, \u201c/kill/terfs 2K14.\u201d Another suggested, \u201chow about \u2018slowly and horrendously murder terfs in saw-like torture machines and contraptions\u2019 2K14.\u201d A young blogger holding a knife posted a selfie with the caption \u201cFetch me a terf.\u201d Such threats have become so common that radical-feminist Web sites have taken to cataloguing them. \u201cIt\u2019s aggrieved entitlement,\u201d Lierre Keith told me. \u201cThey are so angry that we will not see them as women.\u201d Keith is a writer and an activist who runs a small permaculture farm in Northern California. She is forty-nine, with cropped pewter hair and a uniform of black T-shirts and jeans. Three years ago, she co-founded the ecofeminist group Deep Green Resistance, which has some two hundred members and links the oppression of women to the pillaging of the planet. D.G.R. is defiantly militant, refusing to condemn the use of violence in the service of goals it considers just. In radical circles, though, what makes the group truly controversial is its stance on gender. As members see it, a person born with male privilege can no more shed it through surgery than a white person can claim an African-American identity simply by darkening his or her skin. Before D.G.R. held its first conference, in 2011, in Wisconsin, the group informed a person in the process of a male-to-female transition that she couldn\u2019t stay in the women\u2019s quarters. \u201cWe said, That\u2019s fine if you want to come, but, no, you\u2019re not going to have access to the women\u2019s sleeping spaces and the women\u2019s bathrooms,\u201d Keith told me. Last February, Keith was to be a keynote speaker at the Public Interest Environmental Law Conference, at the University of Oregon, in Eugene, but the student government voted to condemn her, and more than a thousand people signed a petition demanding that the address be cancelled. Amid threats of violence, six policemen escorted Keith to the lectern, though, in the end, the protest proved peaceful: some audience members walked out and held a rally, leaving her to speak to a half-empty room. Keith had an easier time at Radfems Respond, where she spoke on the differences between radicalism and liberalism.

A men\u2019s-rights activist showed up\u2014he later posted mocking clips from a video that he had secretly made\u2014but said nothing during the sessions. Several trans women arrived and sat at the back, but, in fact, they were there to express solidarity, having decided that the attacks on radical feminists were both out of control and misguided. One of them, a thin, forty-year-old blonde from the Bay Area, who blogs under the name Snowflake Especial, noted that all the violence against trans women that she\u2019s aware of was committed by men. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we dealing with them?\u201d she asked. Despite that surprising show of support, most of the speakers felt embattled. Heath Atom Russell gave the closing talk. A stocky woman, with curly turquoise hair and a bluish stubble shadow on her cheeks, she wore a T-shirt that read \u201cI Survived Testosterone Poisoning.\u201d At twenty-five, she is a \u201cdetransitioner,\u201d a person who once identified as transgender but no longer does. (Expert estimates of the number of transitioners who abandon their new gender range from fewer than one per cent to as many as five per cent.) Russell, a lesbian who grew up in a conservative Baptist family in Southern California, began transitioning to male as a student at Humboldt State University, and was embraced by gender-rights groups on campus. She started taking hormones and changed her name. Then, in her senior year, she discovered \u201cUnpacking Queer Politics\u201d (2003), by Sheila Jeffreys, which critiques female-to-male transsexualism as capitulation to misogyny. At first, the book infuriated Russell, but she couldn\u2019t let go of the questions that it raised about her own identity. She had been having heart palpitations, which made her uneasy about the hormones she was taking. Nor did she ever fully believe herself to be male. At one point during her transition, she hooked up with a middle-aged trans woman. Russell knew that she was supposed to think of herself as a man with a woman, but, she said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right, and I was scared.\u201d Eventually, she proclaimed herself a woman again, and a radical feminist, though it meant being ostracized by many of her friends. She is now engaged to a woman; someone keyed the word \u201cdyke\u201d on her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s car. Russell appears in Sheila Jeffreys\u2019s new book, \u201cGender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism.\u201d Jeffreys, who is sixty-six, has short silver hair and a weathered face. She has taught at the University of Melbourne for twenty-three years, but she grew up in London, and has been described as the Andrea Dworkin of the U.K. She has written nine previous books, all of which focus on the sexual subjugation of women, whether through rape, incest, pornography, prostitution, or Western beauty norms. Like Dworkin, she is viewed as a heroine by a cadre of like-minded admirers and as a zealot by others. In 2005, in an admiring feature in the Guardian, Julie Bindel wrote, \u201cJeffreys sees sexuality as the basis of the oppression of women by men, in much the same way as Marx saw capitalism as the scourge of the working class. This unwavering belief has made her many enemies. Postmodern theorist Judith Halberstam once said, \u2018If Sheila Jeffreys did not exist, Camille Paglia would have had to invent her.\u2019 \u201d In eight brisk chapters (half of them written with Jeffreys\u2019s former Ph.D. student Lorene Gottschalk), \u201cGender Hurts\u201d offers Jeffreys\u2019s first full-length treatment of transgenderism. Ordinarily, Jeffreys told me, she would launch the publication of a new book with an event at the university, but this time campus security warned against it. She has also taken her name off her office door. She gave a talk in London this month, but it was invitation-only. In the book, Jeffreys calls detransitioners like Russell \u201csurvivors,\u201d and cites them as evidence that transgenderism isn\u2019t immutable and thus doesn\u2019t warrant radical medical intervention. (She considers gender-reassignment surgery a form of mutilation.) \u201cThe phenomenon of regret undermines the idea that there exists a particular kind of person who is genuinely and essentially transgender and can be identified accurately by psychiatrists,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is radically destabilising to the transgender project.\u201d She cites as further evidence the case of Bradley Cooper, who, in 2011, at the age of seventeen, became Britain\n\nquestion: What government position did Shirley Temple hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1053}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Jeffreys is especially alarmed by doctors in Europe, Australia, and the United States who treat transgender children with puberty-delaying drugs, which prevent them from developing unwanted secondary sex characteristics and can result in sterilization. Throughout the book, Jeffreys insists on using male pronouns to refer to trans women and female ones to refer to trans men. \u201cUse by men of feminine pronouns conceals the masculine privilege bestowed upon them by virtue of having been placed in and brought up in the male sex caste,\u201d she writes. To her critics, the book becomes particularly hateful when she tries to account for the reality of trans people. Explaining female-to-male transition is fairly easy for her (and for other radical feminists): women seek to become men in order to raise their status in a sexist system. Heath Atom Russell, for example, is quoted as attributing her former desire to become a man to the absence of a \u201cproud woman loving culture.\u201d But, if that\u2019s true, why would men demote themselves to womanhood? For reasons of sexual fetishism, Jeffreys says. She substantiates her argument with the highly controversial theories of Ray Blanchard, a retired professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the related work of J. Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University. Contrary to widespread belief, Blanchard says, the majority of trans women in the West start off not as effeminate gay men but as straight or bisexual men, and they are initially motivated by erotic compulsion rather than by any conceived female identity. \u201cThe core is, it\u2019s really exciting for guys to imagine themselves with female breasts, or female breasts and a vulva,\u201d he told me. To describe the syndrome, Blanchard coined the term \u201cautogynephilia,\u201d meaning sexual arousal at the thought of oneself as female. Blanchard is far from a radical feminist. He believes that gender-reassignment surgery can relieve psychological suffering; he has even counselled people who undergo it. He also accepts the commonly held view that male brains differ from female brains in ways that affect behavior. Nevertheless, Jeffreys believes that the work of Blanchard and Bailey shows that when trans women ask to be accepted as women they\u2019re seeking to have an erotic fixation indulged. The last time a feminist of any standing published an attack on transgenderism as caustic as \u201cGender Hurts\u201d was in 1979, when Janice Raymond produced \u201cThe Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.\u201d Raymond was a lesbian ex-nun who became a doctoral student of the radical-feminist theologian Mary Daly, at Boston College. Inspired by the women\u2019s-health movement, Raymond framed much of \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d as a critique of a patriarchal medical and psychiatric establishment. Still, the book was frequently febrile, particularly with regard to lesbian trans women. \u201cAll transsexuals rape women\u2019s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves,\u201d Raymond wrote. \u201cHowever, the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist violates women\u2019s sexuality and spirit.\u201d It\u2019s a measure of how much perceptions have changed in the past thirty-five years that \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d received a respectful, even admiring hearing in the mainstream media, unlike \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d which has been largely ignored there. Reviewing \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d in the Times, the psychiatrist Thomas Szasz called it \u201cflawless.\u201d Raymond, he wrote, \u201chas rightly seized on transsexualism as an emblem of modern society\u2019s unremitting\u2014though increasingly concealed\u2014antifeminism.\u201d One of the women Raymond wrote about was Sandy Stone, a performance artist and academic who this fall will teach digital arts and new media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. When Raymond\u2019s book was published, Stone was a recording engineer at Olivia Records, a women\u2019s-music collective in Los Angeles. In the late sixties, after graduating from college, and while still living as a man, she had bluffed her way into a job at New York\u2019s famed Record Plant recording studio, where she worked with Jimi Hendrix and the Velvet Underground. (For a time, she slept in the studio basement, on a pile of Hendrix\u2019s capes.) She moved to the West Coast and transitioned in 1974. Olivia approached her soon afterward; experienced female recording engineers were hard to find. Stone became a member of the collective the next year and moved into a communal house that it rented, where she was the only trans woman among a dozen or so other lesbians.

She eventually earned a doctorate in philosophy at Santa Cruz. In 1987, Stone wrote an essay, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto,\u201d which is widely seen as the founding text of transgender studies. It\u2019s still taught around the world; a second French edition is about to be published, and Stone has received a request to allow a Catalan translation. The last time that Janice Raymond wrote on transgender issues was in 1994, for a new introduction to \u201cThe Transsexual Empire.\u201d Since then, she has focussed on sex trafficking, and last August a Norwegian government agency invited her to Oslo to speak on a panel about prostitution legislation. When she arrived, however, an official informed her that she had been disinvited; a letter to the editor of a major Norwegian newspaper had accused her of transphobia. Raymond says that similar things have \u201chappened much more frequently within the last couple of years.\u201d The most dramatic change in the perception of transgenderism can be seen in academia. Particularly at liberal-arts colleges, students are now routinely asked which gender pronoun they would prefer to be addressed by: choices might include \u201cze,\u201d \u201cou,\u201d \u201chir,\u201d \u201cthey,\u201d or even \u201cit.\u201d A decade ago, no university offered a student health plan that covered gender-reassignment surgery. Today, dozens do, including Harvard, Brown, Duke, Yale, Stanford, and the schools in the University of California system. There are young transgender-critical radical feminists, like Heath Atom Russell and Rachel Ivey, aged twenty-four, who was one of the organizers of Radfems Respond, but they are the first to admit that they\u2019re a minority. \u201cIf I were to say in a typical women\u2019s-studies class today, \u2018Female people are oppressed on the basis of reproduction,\u2019 I would get called out,\u201d Ivey says. Other students, she adds, would ask, \u201cWhat about women who are male?\u201d That might be an exaggeration, but only a slight one. The members of the board of the New York Abortion Access Fund, an all-volunteer group that helps to pay for abortions for those who can\u2019t afford them, are mostly young women; Alison Turkos, the group\u2019s co-chair, is twenty-six. In May, they voted unanimously to stop using the word \u201cwomen\u201d when talking about people who get pregnant, so as not to exclude trans men. \u201cWe recognize that people who identify as men can become pregnant and seek abortions,\u201d the group\u2019s new Statement of Values says. A Change.org petition asks NARAL and Planned Parenthood to adopt similarly gender-inclusive language. It specifically criticizes the hashtag #StandWithTexasWomen, which ricocheted around Twitter during State Senator Wendy Davis\u2019s filibuster against an anti-abortion bill in her state, and the phrase \u201cTrust Women,\u201d which was the slogan of George Tiller, the doctor and abortion provider who was murdered in Wichita in 2009. To some younger activists, it seems obvious that anyone who objects to such changes is simply clinging to the privilege inherent in being cisgender, a word popularized in the nineteen-nineties to mean any person who is not transgender. Alison Turkos has heard complaints that the new language obscures the fact that cisgender women overwhelmingly bear the brunt of the current political attacks on reproductive rights. She replies, \u201cIt may not feel comfortable, but it\u2019s important to create a space for more people who are often denied space and visibility.\u201d Older feminists who have not yet adopted this way of thinking can find themselves experiencing ideological whiplash. Sara St. Martin Lynne, a forty-year-old filmmaker and video producer from Oakland, told me, \u201cWhen you come from a liberation, leftist background, you want to be on the right side of history,\u201d and the debate \u201ckind of puts you through your paces.\u201d Last year, she was asked to resign from the board of Bay Area Girls Rock Camp, a nonprofit that \u201cempowers girls through music,\u201d because of her involvement with the Michigan Womyn\u2019s Music Festival, which bills itself as an event for \u201cwomyn-born womyn\n\nquestion: What government position did Shirley Temple hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1029}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Michfest, as it\u2019s called, takes place every August, on six hundred and fifty acres of land in the woods east of Lake Michigan. Lisa Vogel founded it in 1976, when she was a nineteen-year-old Central Michigan University student, and she still runs it. The music, Vogel says, is only part of what makes Michfest important. Each year, several thousand women set up camp there and find themselves, for a week, living in a matriarchy. Meals are cooked in kitchen tents and eaten communally. There are workshops and classes. Some women don extravagant costumes; others wear nothing at all. There is free child care and a team to assist disabled women who ordinarily cannot go camping. Vogel describes the governing ethos as \u201cHow would a town look if we actually got to decide what was important?\u201d She told me, \u201cThere\u2019s something that I experience on the land when I walk at night without a flashlight in the woods and recognize that for that moment I feel completely safe. And there\u2019s nowhere else I can do that.\u201d She continued, \u201cIf, tomorrow, we said everyone is welcome, I\u2019m sure it would still be a really cool event, but that piece that allows women to let down their guard and feel that really deep sense of personal liberation would be different, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about.\u201d To transgender activists, Vogel\u2019s stance is laden with offensive assumptions: that trans women are different in an essential way from other women, and that they\u2019re dangerous. \u201cThe trope of trans women\u201d constituting \u201ca threat to women\u2019s spaces has been tossed around forever,\u201d Julia Serano told me. To her, it\u2019s akin to straight people refusing to share a locker room with gays or lesbians. Serano, forty-six, is a biologist by training who now spends most of her time writing and speaking on transgender issues and feminism; last year, she lectured at schools including Brown, Stanford, Smith, and Cornell. (Sheila Jeffreys attacks her in \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d using autobiographical details from Serano\u2019s first book, \u201cWhipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity\u201d (2007), to paint her as an autogynephile who seeks to \u201creinvent \u2018feminism\u2019 to fit his erotic interests.\u201d) In the summer of 2003, Serano joined about a hundred people at Camp Trans, a protest camp near the Michfest site, which has run intermittently since 1994. Serano said that relations with Michfest attendees were often unexpectedly cordial. A few years ago, though, Vogel says, some protesters committed acts of vandalism\u2014stealing electrical cables, cutting water pipes, keying cars in the parking lot, and spray-painting a six-foot penis, and the words \u201cReal Women Have Dicks,\u201d on the side of the main kitchen tent. Since then, as with the case of Olivia Records, the demonstrations have been supplanted by a boycott campaign. Last year, the Indigo Girls, longtime regulars at Michfest, announced that they wouldn\u2019t appear again until the event became trans-inclusive. This year, the scheduled headliners, Hunter Valentine, pulled out for the same reason. Performers who do appear face protests and boycotts of their own; the funk singer Shelley Nicole says that her band, blaKb\u00fcshe, was dropped from a show in Brooklyn because it is playing at Michfest next month. Before Sara St. Martin Lynne was asked to leave the Bay Area Girls Rock Camp board, she hadn\u2019t identified closely with radical feminism. Yet, as the campaign against Michfest\u2014and against radical feminism as a whole\u2014has grown, she\u2019s come to feel strongly about keeping the event \u201cwomyn-born-womyn.\u201d She said, \u201cThis moment where we\u2019re losing the ability to say the word \u2018woman\u2019 or to acknowledge the fact that being born female has lived consequences and meaning is kind of intense to me.\u201d One of the trans women who showed up at the Radfems Respond conference, a thirty-five-year-old software engineer from California, with a tiny nose stud and long brown hair, agrees. She understands why trans women are hurt by their exclusion from Michfest and other female-only events and facilities, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not really wanting to invade space. It\u2019s a deep-seated wanting to belong.\u201d But, she adds, \u201cif you\u2019re identifying with women, shouldn\u2019t you be empathizing with women?\u201d Sandy Stone shares this view\u2014up to a point.

Although it was CBS's answer to NBC's A Date with Judy, it was also broadcast by NBC in 1948 as a summer replacement for The Bob Hope Show. From October 3, 1952, to June 26, 1953, it aired on ABC, finally returning to CBS. Despite the program's long run, fewer than 24 episodes are known to exist. Priscilla Lyon and Janet Waldo successively portrayed 15-year-old Corliss on radio. Lugene Sanders also played Corliss briefly on radio and in the CBS version of the Meet Corliss Archer television show. Perpetually perky, breathless and well-intentioned, Corliss is constantly at the side of her next-door neighbor and boyfriend, Dexter Franklin (Bill Christy, Sam Edwards). Clumsy, nerdy Dexter, a sweet but constant bungler with a nasal voice, is best remembered for his trademark phrase, \"Holy cow!\" and his braying call, \"Heyyyy, Corrrrrliiiiiss!\"\u2014frequently delivered from the hedge separating their houses. Harry Archer, Corliss's father, is a lawyer who tolerates Dexter only when he wants to use him to help flaunt male superiority. Gruff but gentle, he was played by Bob Bailey, Fred Shields and Frank Martin. Janet Archer, Corliss's mother, was played by, successively, Irene Tedrow, Monty Margetts and Gloria Holden. She is calm and understanding with her daughter and her husband, both of whom sometimes try her patience. Other frequent characters include Mildred Ames, a good friend of Corliss (played by Bebe Young and Barbara Whiting); Mildred's irritating younger brother Raymond (Tommy Bernard, Kenny Godkin); and Corliss's rival, Betty Cameron (Delores Crane). Meet Corliss Archer was written by F. Hugh Herbert, who first introduced the character and her friends in a Good Housekeeping magazine story \"A Private Affair,\" the first of a series of stories. Kiss and Tell was a 1943 play that was adapted for a 1945 film starring Shirley Temple. The 1949 sequel, A Kiss for Corliss, was re-released in 1954. Herbert's Meet Corliss Archer property was adapted to television in 1951 and 1952 with live broadcasts produced and aired by CBS. In 1954 and 1955 Ziv Television Programs produced a syndicated telefilm series starring Ann Baker and Mary Brian. One of the show's unique features was the occasional cut to a comic-book-style drawing, with announcer's commentary, that illustrated the current story situation and was used several times during each episode. The program was produced by Ziv Productions. Several episodes of the Ziv version are available on DVD, and some are also available from the Internet Archive. Robin Morgan portrayed Corliss in a live telecast of Kiss and Tell on The Alcoa Hour (August 5, 1956), with Warren Berlinger as Dexter. Radio listeners had to use their imaginations to visualize Corliss, her friends and her town. But those imaginations got a boost in 1948 when the Meet Corliss Archer comic book, published by Fox Feature Syndicate, came out in three issues from March to July 1948. Al Feldstein (Albert B. Feldstein), later the editor of Mad, was a key writer and illustrator of this short-lived comic book series, which is now remembered primarily for his artwork in general and the good girl art covers in particular. Film strips and radio microphones on the front cover indicated the tie-ins and media crossovers. Janet Waldo was depicted on the front cover twice, as herself and as Corliss.\n\nquestion: What government position did Robin Morgan hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 898}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since the early 1960s, she has been a key radical feminist member of the American Women's Movement, and a leader in the international feminist movement. Her 1970 anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful was cited by the New York Public Library as \"One of the 100 Most Influential Books of the 20th Century.\". She has written more than 20 books of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, and was editor of Ms. magazine. During the 1960s, she participated in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements; in the late 1960s, she was a founding member of radical feminist organizations such as New York Radical Women and W.I.T.C.H. She founded or co-founded the Feminist Women's Health Network, the National Battered Women's Refuge Network, Media Women, the National Network of Rape Crisis Centers, the Feminist Writers' Guild, the Women's Foreign Policy Council, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, GlobalSister.org, and Greenstone Women's Radio Network. She also co-founded the Women's Media Center with activist Gloria Steinem and actor/activist Jane Fonda. In 2018, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women. Due to circumstances at her birth, her mother claimed that Robin Morgan was born a year later than she actually was (see birth and parents), and throughout her career as a child actor, she was thought to be a year younger than she actually was, both by herself and others. Already as a toddler, her mother, Faith, and mother's sister Sally started Robin as a child model. At the age of five, believed to be four, she got her own program, titled Little Robin Morgan, on the New York radio station WOR. She was also a regular on the original network radio version of Juvenile Jury. Her acting career took off when she was eight and started in the TV series Mama, as Dagmar Hansen, the younger sister in the family depicted in the series. The show premiered on CBS in 1949, starring Peggy Wood, and was a great success. Morgan played Cecchina Cabrini in Citizen Saint (1947). During the Golden Age of Television, Morgan starred in such \"TV spectaculars\" as Kiss and Tell and Alice in Wonderland, and guest starred on such live dramas as Omnibus, Suspense, Danger, Hallmark Hall of Fame, Robert Montgomery Presents, Tales of Tomorrow, and Kraft Theatre. She worked with directors such as Sidney Lumet, John Frankenheimer, Ralph Nelson; writers such as Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling; and performed with actors such as Boris Karloff, Rosalind Russell, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, and Cliff Robertson. Having wanted to write rather than to act since she was four, Morgan fought her mother's efforts to keep her in show business, and left the cast of Mama at age 14. As she entered adulthood, Robin Morgan continued her education as a non-matriculating student at Columbia University. She began working as a secretary at Curtis Brown Literary Agency, where she met and worked with such writers as poet W. H. Auden in the early 1960s. She had already begun publishing her own poetry (later collected in her first book of poems, Monster, published in 1972). Throughout the next decades, along with political activism, writing fiction and nonfiction prose, and lecturing at colleges and universities on women's rights, Morgan continued to write and publish poetry. In 1962, Morgan married poet Kenneth Pitchford. She gave birth to their son, Blake Morgan, in 1969. The couple divorced in 1983. At that time, she was working as an editor at Grove Press and was involved in an attempt to unionize the publishing industry. When Grove summarily fired her and other union sympathizers, she led a seizure and occupation of their offices in the spring of 1970, protesting the union-busting, as well as the dishonest accounting of royalties to Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow. Morgan and eight other women were arrested that day. In the mid-1970s Morgan became a Contributing Editor to Ms. magazine, and continued her affiliation there as a part- or full-time editor in the following decades. She served as editor-in-chief of the magazine from 1989 to 1994, turning it into a highly successful, ad-free, bimonthly, international publication, which won awards for both writing and design, and received considerable acclaim among journalists. In 1979, when the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed, featuring famous women from politics, media and entertainment, culture, sports, and other areas of achievement, one of the cards featured Morgan's name and picture. Today, the trading cards are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the University of Iowa library. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit\n\nquestion: What government position did Robin Morgan hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1137}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Seven years later, in 2012, she debuted a weekly radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live With Robin Morgan. The broadcast is syndicated in the US and, as a podcast, is published online at the WMCLive website, and distributed on iTunes in 110 countries. It has been praised by The Huffington Post as \"talk radio with a brain\" and features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. The weekly hour was picked up by CBS Radio two weeks after its launch and is broadcast on CBS affiliate WJFK each Saturday. The program features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. By 1962 Morgan had become active in the anti-war Left, and had also contributed articles and poetry to such Left-wing and counter-culture journals as Liberation, Rat, Win, and The National Guardian. In the 1960s she became increasingly involved in social-justice movements, notably the civil-rights and anti-Vietnam war. In early 1967, she was active in the Youth International Party (known in the media as the \"Yippies\"), with Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner. However, tensions over sexism within the YIP (and the New Left in general) came to a head when Morgan grew more involved in Women's Liberation and contemporary feminism. In 1967, Morgan became a founding member of the short-lived New York Radical Women group. She was the key organizer of their September 1968 inaugural protest of the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City. Morgan wrote the Miss America protest pamphlet No More Miss America!, and that same year cofounded Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.), a radical feminist group that used public street theater (called \"hexes\" or \"zaps\") to call attention to sexism. Morgan designed the universal symbol of the women\u2019s movement\u2013\u2013the female symbol, a circle with a cross beneath, centered with a raised fist. The Oxford English Dictionary also credits her with first using the term \"herstory\" in print in her 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful. Concerning the feminist organization W.I.T.C.H., Morgan wrote: With the royalties from her anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful, Morgan founded the first feminist grant-giving foundation in the US: The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, which provided seed money to many early women's groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s. She made a decisive break from what she described as the \"male Left\" when she led the women's takeover of the underground newspaper Rat in 1970, and listed the reasons for her break in the first women's issue of the paper, in her essay titled \"Goodbye to All That\". The essay gained notoriety in the press for naming specific sexist men and institutions in the Left. Decades later, during the Democratic primaries for the 2008 presidential race, Morgan wrote a fiery sequel to her original essay, titled \"Goodbye To All That #2\", in defense of Hillary Clinton. The article quickly went viral on the internet for lambasting sexist rhetoric directed towards Clinton by the media. In 1977, Morgan became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Morgan has traveled extensively across the United States and around the world to bring attention to cross-cultural sexism. She has met with and interviewed female rebel fighters in the Philippines, Brazilian women activists in the slums/favelas of Rio, women organizers in the townships of South Africa, and underground feminists in Iran. Twice\u2013\u2013in 1986 and 1989 she spent months in the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, West Bank, and Gaza, to report on the conditions of women. Morgan has also spoken at universities and institutions in countries across Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America, as well as in Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. Over the years, Morgan has received numerous awards for her activism on women\u2019s rights. The Feminist Majority Foundation named Robin Morgan \"Woman of the Year\" in 1990; she received the Warrior Woman Award for Promoting Racial Understanding from The Asian American Women's National Organization in 1992; in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now, and in 2003 The Feminist Press gave her a \"Femmy\" Award for her \"service to literature\". She has also received the Humanist Heroine Award from The American Humanist Association in 2007.

They asked that stations licensed for public airwaves carrying Limbaugh be held accountable for contravening public interest as a continual promoter of hate speech against various disempowered and minority groups. In 1970, Morgan compiled, edited, and introduced the first anthology of feminist writings, Sisterhood is Powerful. The compilation included now-classic feminist essays by such activists as Naomi Weisstein, Kate Millett, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Florynce Kennedy, Frances M. Beal, Joreen, Marge Piercy, Lucinda Cisler and Mary Daly, as well as historical documents including the N.O.W. Bill of Rights, excerpts from the SCUM Manifesto, the Redstockings Manifesto, historical documents from W.I.T.C.H., and a germinal statement from the Black Women\u2019s Liberation Group of Mount Vernon. It also included what Morgan called \"verbal karate\": useful quotes and statistics about women. The anthology was cited by the New York Public Library as one of the \u201cNew York Public Library's Books of the  Century\u201d. Morgan established the first American feminist grant-giving organization, The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, with the royalties from Sisterhood Is Powerful. However, the anthology was banned in Chile, China, and South Africa. Her follow-up volume in 1984, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology, compiled articles about women in over seventy countries. That same year she founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, notable for being the first international feminist think tank. Repeatedly refusing the post of president, she was elected secretary of the organization from 1989 to 1993, was VP from 1993 to 1997, and after serving on the advisory board, finally agreed to become president in 2004. A third volume, Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium in 2003, was a collection of articles mostly by well-known feminists, both young and \"vintage\", in a retrospective on and future blueprint for the feminist movement. It was compiled, edited, and with an introduction by Morgan, and Morgan wrote \"To Vintage Feminists\" and \"To Younger Women\", which were both included in the anthology as Personal Postscripts. Morgan's articles, essays, reviews, interviews, political analyses, and investigative journalism have appeared widely in such publications as The Atlantic, Broadsheet, Chrysalis, Essence, Everywoman, The Feminist Art Journal, The Guardian (US), The Guardian (UK), The Hudson Review, the Los Angeles Times, Ms., The New Republic, The New York Times, Off Our Backs, Pacific Ways, The Second Wave, Sojourner, The Village Voice, The Voice of Women, and various United Nations periodicals, etc. Articles and essays have also appeared in reprint in international media, in English across the Commonwealth, and in translation in 13 languages in Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. Morgan has served as a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for many years, receiving the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism for her cover story titled \"The First Feminist Exiles from the USSR\" in 1981. She served as the magazine's editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, re-launching it as an ad-free, international bimonthly publication in 1991. This earned her a series of awards, including the award for Editorial Excellence by Utne Reader in 1991, and the Exceptional Merit in Journalism Award by the National Women's Political Caucus. Morgan resigned her post in 1994 to become Consulting Global Editor of the magazine, which she remains to this day. Morgan has written for online audiences and blogged frequently. Among her best known articles are \"Letters from Ground Zero\" (written and posted after the September 11 attacks in 2001 \u2014 which went viral), \"Goodbye To All That #2\", \"Women of the Arab Spring\", \"When Bad News is Good News: Notes of a Feminist News Junkie\", \"Manhood and Moral Waivers\", and \"Faith Healing: A Modest Proposal on Religious Fundamentalism\". Her online work is hosted in the archives of the Women's Media Center. Robin Morgan has published 21 books, including works of poetry, fiction, and the now-classic anthologies Sisterhood Is Powerful, Sisterhood Is Global, and Sisterhood Is Forever. Well before she was known as a feminist leader, literary magazines published her as a serious poet. According to a 1972 review of her first book of poems, Monster, in The Washington Post: \" establish Morgan as a poet of considerable means. There is a savage elegance, a richness of vocabulary, a thrust and steely polish..... A powerful, challenging book.\" In 1979 Morgan received a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in poetry,\n\nquestion: What government position did Robin Morgan hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1138}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

During this time she worked on a cycle of verse plays. Morgan\u2019s poetry collections include A Hot January: Poems 1996\u20131999 (W. W. Norton, 1999), Depth Perception: New Poems and a Masque (Doubleday, 1994), Upstairs in the Garden: Poems Selected and New 1968\u20131988 (W. W. Norton, 1990), Death Benefits (Copper Canyon Press, 1981), Lady of the Beasts (Random House, 1976), and Monster (Random House, 1972). Of the book A Hot January, Alice Walker wrote: \"Morgan proves that exquisite poetry can be the most surprising gift of grief. A volume as proud, fierce, vulnerable, and brave as the poet herself.\" A review of Upstairs in the Garden, noted: \"As a vindication and celebration of the female experience, these inventive poems successfully wed feminist rhetoric with vivid imagery and sensitivity to the music of language.\" Two books of poems, Lady of the Beasts and Depth Perception, earned reviews in Poetry Magazine with critic Jay Parini stating that \"Robin Morgan will soon be regarded as one of our first-ranking poets.\" Morgan had published three books of fiction as of 2015. Her debut novel was the semi-autobiographical Dry Your Smile (published by Doubleday & Company, 1987), followed by The Mer-Child: A Legend for Children and Other Adults (published by The Feminist Press at City University of New York, 1991). Her most recent work of fiction is a historical novel titled The Burning Time (Melville House Books, 2006), set in the 14th century, based on court records of the first witchcraft trial in Ireland. The Burning Time was placed on the Recommended Quality Fiction List of 2007 by the American Library Association, in addition to being the 2006 Paperback Pick by Book Sense (The American Booksellers Association). Morgan has compiled, edited, and introduced several influential anthologies: Sisterhood Is Powerful: The Women\u2019s Liberation Anthology (1970), Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), and Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003). She has herself written non-fiction, including Going Too Far (1978), The Anatomy of Freedom (1984), The Demon Lover: On the Sexuality of Terrorism (1989), The Word of a Woman (1994), and Saturday\u2019s Child: A Memoir (2001). One of the most widely translated of Morgan\u2019s books and a best-seller, The Demon Lover is a commentary on the psychological and political roots of terrorism, and New York Times Book Review called it \"Important...compelling.... is intense and at times magnificent.\" Her most recently published book of non-fiction is Fighting Words: A Tool Kit for Combating the Religious Right (2006). In 1984, Morgan, together with the late Simone de Beauvoir of France, and women from 80 other countries, founded The Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI), an international non-profit NGO with consultative status to the United Nations, which has for three decades functioned as the world\u2019s first feminist think-tank. The Institute has played a leading policy-formulation, strategic, and activist role in the evolution of the international Women\u2019s Movement. SIGI has also developed a global communications network through which an umbrella of NGO interest, advice, contacts, and support is collectively mobilized to empower the global women\u2019s movement. Among its many activities, the Institute pioneered the first Urgent Acton Alerts regarding women\u2019s rights; the first Global Campaign To Make Visible Women\u2019s Unpaid Labor In National Accounts; and the first Women\u2019s Rights Manuals For Muslim Societies (in 12 languages). Its most recent project is Donor Direct Action (donordirectaction.org), which links front-line women\u2019s rights activists around the world to money, visibility, and popular support: minimum bureaucracy, maximum impact. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit progressive organization, The Women\u2019s Media Center with her friends actor/activist Jane Fonda, and activist Gloria Steinem. The focus of the organization is to make women powerful and visible in the media. An invited speaker at numerous universities in North America, Morgan has traveled\u2014as organizer, speaker, journalist\u2014across North America, Europe, and the Middle East to Australia, Brazil, the Caribbean, Central America, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. She has also been a guest professor or scholar in residence at a variety of academic institutions. She was guest chair for feminist studies at the New College of Florida in 1971; a visiting professor at The Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture at Rutgers University in 1987; a distinguished visiting scholar in residence for literary and cultural studies at the University of Canterbury, Christ\n\nquestion: What government position did Robin Morgan hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1121}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She was awarded an honorary degree as a Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs in 1992. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection that documents the personal, political, and professional aspects of Morgan's life, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. They date from the 1940s to the present. Robin Morgan has been arrested, and has received death threats from both the Right and the Left because of her activism. According to a New Yorker magazine article published in the aftermath of Morgan's essay \"Goodbye to All That\" (#2) going viral on the Internet, \"At five feet tall Morgan is, not for the first time, the little woman who has started a big war.\" In her original essay, \"Goodbye to All That\" (1970), Morgan bade adieu to \"the dream that being in the leadership collective will get you anything but gonorrhea,\" referring to the \"male Left\". She also asserted that Charles Manson was \"only the logical extreme of the normal American male\u2019s fantasy.\" Two years later, Morgan published the poem \"Arraignment\", in which she openly accused Ted Hughes of the battery and murder of Sylvia Plath. There were lawsuits, Morgan's 1972 book Monster which contained that poem was banned, and underground, pirated feminist editions of it were published. As the leading organizer of the 1968 protest of the Miss America Pageant, \"No More Miss America!\", Morgan attacked the pageant\u2019s \"ludicrous 'beauty' standards and also accused the pageant of being racist, since at that time no African American woman had been a contestant. In addition\u2013\u2013according to Morgan\u2013\u2013in sending pageant winners to entertain troops in Vietnam, the women served as \"death mascots\" in an immoral war. Morgan asked, \"Where else could one find such a perfect combination of American values -- racism, militarism, capitalism -- all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol, a woman.\" Another controversial quote is from her 1978 book, Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist, where she stated: \"I feel that \"man-hating\" is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.\" Morgan famously walked off The Tonight Show in 1969 when it screened vintage footage of her as a child actor while she was trying to speak seriously about the first national march against rape. Of the incident, she has been quoted as saying: \"Imagine talking about such a subject and having it trivialized like that.\" In 1974, with her phrase \"Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice\" (from her essay \"Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape\"), she became a central figure on one of the divisive issues in feminism, particularly among anti-pornography feminists in Anglophone countries. In 1973, Robin Morgan gave the keynote speech at the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in which she criticized Beth Elliott, a performer and organizer of the conference, for being a transgender woman. In this speech she referred to Elliott as a \"transsexual male\" and used male pronouns throughout, charging her with being \"an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer-with the mentality of a rapist.\" At the end of her speech she called for a vote on ejecting Elliott, with over two-thirds voting to allow her to remain, however the minority threatened to disrupt the conference and Elliott chose to leave after her performance to avoid this. The event demonstrated the high tension surrounding transgender women's involvement in the women's movement of the 1970s. Robin Morgan grew up in New York, first in Mount Vernon, and later in Manhattan, on Sutton Place. She graduated from The Wetter School in Mount Vernon, in 1956, and was privately tutored from then until 1959. She published her first serious poetry in literary magazines at age 17. In an article published in the Jewish Women's Archive, Morgan reveals she is of Jewish ancestry, but identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She is quoted as saying, \"When compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Ashkenazic (with a touch of Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\" Morgan continues to tackle topics such as religion, politics and sex in fiery commentaries on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan.

In 2000 Norton published Morgan\u2019s memoir, Saturday's Child, in which she wrote candidly about \"the shadowy circumstances of her birth; a lifelong, impassioned, love-hate relationship with her mother; her years as a famous child actor and her fight to escape show business to become a serious writer; her marriage to a fiery bisexual poet and how motherhood transformed her life; her years in the civil rights movement, the New Left, and counterculture; her emergence a leader of global feminism; and her love affairs with women as well as men,\" according to BookNews.com. In her book, \"her passion for writing, especially poetry, is vividly conveyed, as is her love and respect for her son, born in 1969,\" according to The New York Times Book Review. In April 2013, Morgan announced publicly that she had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, discussing the diagnosis on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan, revealing that she had been diagnosed in 2010, but that her quality of life was thus far \"normal\". Since her diagnosis, Morgan has become active with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation (PDF), completing training to become part of the organization's Parkinson's Advocates in Research initiative. In 2014 she was the catalyst and took a leadership role in PDF's new Women and PD initiative, which will seek to better serve women impacted by Parkinson's disease by understanding and resolving gender inequalities in PD research, treatment, and caregiver support. Morgan has also written new poetry inspired by her battle with the disease, and performed a reading of some of the poems as a TED Talk, at the TEDWomen 2015 conference. Her mother, Faith Berkeley Morgan, traveled from her New York residence to Florida to give birth, in order to avoid public scrutiny for her unmarried status. Robin's father, a medical doctor named Mates Morgenstern, did not accompany pregnant Faith on her trip. Until Morgan was 13 years old, her mother Faith claimed that Robin's father had been killed in World War II. However, Robin overheard conversations between her mother and aunt suggesting her father was alive. When she confronted her mother, Faith changed her story to assert that Robin's father had escaped from one Nazi concentration camp after another, and that she had saved his life by sponsoring his immigration to the United States where he had no family. Not until several years later did Robin get proof that this was also a lie. Morgan learned the truth, both about her father, who was still alive, and how old she really was, early in 1961. Now a young woman, no longer working in show business, Robin found a listing for the medical practice of an obstetrician, Dr. Mates Morgenstern, in the New Brunswick, New Jersey telephone directory. Suspecting this might be her father, she had sought a meeting with him, without her mother's knowledge, and ultimately paid a surprise visit to his New Jersey office in January 1961. Morgenstern revealed that he was aware of Robin's fame as a child actor, but had remained firm in his decision to avoid contact with Faith Morgan, having chosen not to see her again after the only time he visited her and the infant Robin. He also told Robin, during their conversation in his medical office, that she in fact was born on January 29, 1941, exactly one year earlier than she thought, and disclosed the copy of her original birth certificate, that he had stored in his office. In order to conceal the out-of-wedlock birth, Faith Morgan had asked her Florida obstetrician to sign an affidavit stating that the birth took place on January 29, 1942. During the conversation in his office, Morgenstern told his daughter that he first met her mother after his arrival in the United States, more than a year before the United States entered World War II, and that she had had nothing to do with his immigration. He added that he had known Faith only briefly and claimed that she had fantasized their relationship as more important than it was. By the time Morgan met her father he had married and had two sons with a woman he had known since they were both children in Austria. Having been separated by the war, they resumed their relationship after she arrived in the United States not long after Robin was born, which probably also added to Morgenstern's decision to abandon Faith and their daughter. Morgan only met her father once more, in February 1965 when he invited her and her husband to his New Jersey home. Morgenstern did not want his sons to know that they had a half-sister and Morgan acceded to his request that they tell his two sons that she was \"the daughter of an old friend.\" She refused to do so again, however, and never met him or her two half-brothers again. Morgan describes the two encounters that she had with her biological father in her autobiography, Saturday's Child: A Memoir.

Hugh Herbert. Kiss and Tell starred Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer and Judith Parrish as her friend Mildred Pringle. The play's great success led to offers from Hollywood for Caulfield, who left the production almost one year to the day from when it opened, and was replaced in her role by her sister Betty Caulfield. Kiss and Tell premiered at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston on March 1, 1943 for tryout performances before its Broadway run. It opened in New York City on March 17, 1943 at the Biltmore Theatre. It remained there until the end of 1944, before transferring to the Bijou Theatre in 1945. It ran for a total of 956 performances before closing on June 23, 1945. The original production was produced by George Abbott and written by F. Hugh Herbert. The cast included Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer, Jessie Royce Landis as Janet Archer, Frances Bavier as Louise, Walter Davis as Uncle George, John Harvey as Private Earhart, Lulu Mae Hubbard as Dorothy Pringle, Robert Keith as Harry Archer, James Lane as Mr. Willard, Tommy Lewis as Raymond Pringle, Robert Lynn as Robert Pringle, Judith Parrish as Mildred Pringle, Calvin Thomas as Bill Franklin, Paula Trueman as Mary Franklin, Robert White as Dexter Franklin, and Richard Widmark as Lieut. Lenny Archer. Two teenage girls become interested in boys, and the girls' parents are making more problems rather than solving them. A film version written by Herbert and based on his play was released by Columbia Pictures on October 4, 1945 with Shirley Temple in the role of Corliss Archer. The film was directed by Richard Wallace and produced by Sol C. Siegel. Temple would reprise the role in the film's sequel A Kiss for Corliss in 1949.\n\nquestion: What government position did Robin Morgan hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 491}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In 1962 she became active in the civil rights and feminist movements, quickly becoming a leader. She worked as a contributing editor for Ms. Magazine for twenty years, serving as editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994. Her editing of the Sisterhood anthologies (beginning with Sisterhood Is Powerful in 1970) has a significant impact on the feminist movement. In 1984 Morgan founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, a think tank for women\u2019s rights worldwide. Morgan continues to write and lecture around the world in addition to hosting a weekly radio and online podcast and webcast program entitled \u201cWomen\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan.\u201d \u201cIf I had to name a single quality characteristic of patriarchy, it would be compartmentalization, the capacity for institutionalizing disconnection. Intellect severed from emotion. Thought separated from action. Science split from art. The earth itself divided\u2014national borders.... The personal isolated from the political. Sex divorced from love\u2026Law detached from justice\u2026If I had to name a single quality characteristic of global feminism, it would be connectivity\u2014a capacity dangerous to every status quo, because of its insistence on noticing.\u201d In her lifetime battle for women\u2019s dignity and global change, Robin Morgan uses words as ammunition, as one can see in the above quotation from The Word of a Woman (1992). As poet, novelist, journalist, lecturer, and feminist theorist, she expresses the reality of contemporary women\u2019s oppression. Morgan was born on January 29, 1941, daughter of Faith Berkeley Morgan, in Lake Worth, Florida. As a child, Morgan\u2019s mother told her that her father had been killed in World War II and later told her other false stories about his identity and fate. Morgan learned the true identity of her father, an obstetrician/gynecologist named Mates Morgenstern, in 1961 when she was nineteen years old. They met only once in person in 1965. When Morgan was not yet a year old, her mother entered her in baby contests and she began a career first as a child model, and later as a child actor and radio personality. She remained a public figure, starring in primetime dramas and specials as well as working on the stage, until the age of fourteen, when she left the limelight to do what she really wanted: to write. Though she never formally enrolled in college, Morgan attended (nonmatriculated) classes and lectures at Columbia University and remained in New York City. At the age of seventeen, she published her first serious poetry in a literary magazine. In 1962, Morgan married writer Kenneth Pitchford, whom she divorced in 1990. Together they had one son, Blake Morgan-Pitchford, born in 1969. Morgan identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She writes: \u201cWhen compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Jews of European origin and their descendants, including most of North and South American Jewry.Ashkenazic (with a touch of Descendants of the Jews who lived in Spain and Portugal before the explusion of 1492; primarily Jews of N. Africa, Italy, the Middle East and the Balkans.Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. And I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\u201d Morgan became an activist during the 1960s and was involved in the civil rights movement, SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee), and the anti-Vietnam War movement. She was also a founding member of New York Radical Women and other radical feminist organizations, such as W.I.T.C.H, which she co-founded in 1968. She was one of the key organizers of the 1968 protest at Atlantic City\u2019s Miss America Contest, which helped launch the second wave of United States feminism. She later reflected on the Miss America pageant, its practices, and the 1968 protest: \u201cwhere else could one find such a perfect combination of American values\u2014racism, militarism, capitalism\u2014all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol: a woman\u201d (Word of a Woman: Feminist Dispatches, 1968-1992). In the following decades, Morgan spearheaded the international women\u2019s liberation movement through her continued activism, her steadfast publishing of feminist poetry and prose, her work as a feminist journalist and editor, and her passionate international lecturing. Morgan coined the term \u201cherstory\u201d in her first published anthology, Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of\n\nquestion: What government position did Robin Morgan hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1110}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Morgan also funded The Sisterhood is Powerful Fund, the first feminist foundation in the United States, with royalties from Sisterhood is Powerful. In 1970, Morgan helped lead the women\u2019s takeover of Rat, a leftist newspaper. Women staffers at the paper and previous contributors like Morgan seized the paper for an issue and never gave it back. In the first women\u2019s issue of the paper, titled \u201cWomen Seize RAT! Sabotage Tales!,\u201d Morgan published what became the famous essay, \u201cGoodbye to All That,\u201d in which she addressed sexism on the Left and \u201cLeftist men\u2019s betrayal of women.\u201d Throughout her career, Morgan has traveled far and wide to interview women rebel fighters in the Philippines, Palestinian women activists in the Intifada, and women in postrevolutionary Iran. She was a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for twenty years, serving as its editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, when it was relaunched as an advertisement-free publication. Since August 2012, Morgan has hosted a nationally syndicated weekly American radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan, in which she discusses current events, interviews guests, produces in-depth investigative reports, and offers commentary on a host of contemporary issues. Morgan has written more than twenty books, including five books of poetry, two novels, and numerous books of essays. She is best known as editor of several important anthologies. Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings from the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement (1970) gives voice to American feminists of the 1960s. These raw and immediate essays cover topics such as female orgasm, the nature of prostitution, the lives of radical lesbians, and the challenge of being Black and female. Morgan\u2019s second groundbreaking edited volume, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), compiles articles about the status of women in seventy countries. In 1984 Morgan co-founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI) with Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986), bringing together the writers of the anthology at an organizing conference. SIGI functions as a think-tank on women\u2019s human rights worldwide. Morgan is also co-founder of The Women\u2019s Media Center with Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem. A third anthology, Sisterhood is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003) was a well-received collection of articles by prominent feminists in which Morgan exhorted both young and the \u201cvintage\u201d feminists to take credit for the astounding and irreversible revolution they brought about. Morgan has since published several further works of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including Fighting Words: A Toolkit for Combating the Religious Right (2006) and a novel, Parallax, published in 2019. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection documenting aspects of Morgan\u2019s political history, personal life, and professional works, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. Morgan has received numerous awards, including the National Endowment for the Arts prize in poetry, the 1990 Feminist Majority Foundation Woman of the Year Award, and the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism. She has also been awarded grants from the Ford Foundation and received prizes for her editorial excellence. In 1992, Morgan was awarded an Honorary Degree as Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs, and in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now. Morgan was also awarded a \u201cFemmy\u201d award from the Feminist Press in 2003 for her \u201cservice to literature\u201d and in 2007 was awarded a Humanist Heroine Award by the American Humanist Association.

The conference had been convened by a group that wanted to defend two positions that have made radical feminism anathema to much of the left. First, the organizers hoped to refute charges that the desire to ban prostitution implies hostility toward prostitutes. Then they were going to try to explain why, at a time when transgender rights are ascendant, radical feminists insist on regarding transgender women as men, who should not be allowed to use women\u2019s facilities, such as public rest rooms, or to participate in events organized exclusively for women. The dispute began more than forty years ago, at the height of the second-wave feminist movement. In one early skirmish, in 1973, the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in Los Angeles, furiously split over a scheduled performance by the folksinger Beth Elliott, who is what was then called a transsexual. Robin Morgan, the keynote speaker, said: I will not call a male \u201cshe\u201d; thirty-two years of suffering in this androcentric society, and of surviving, have earned me the title \u201cwoman\u201d; one walk down the street by a male transvestite, five minutes of his being hassled (which he may enjoy), and then he dares, he dares to think he understands our pain? No, in our mothers\u2019 names and in our own, we must not call him sister. Such views are shared by few feminists now, but they still have a foothold among some self-described radical feminists, who have found themselves in an acrimonious battle with trans people and their allies. Trans women say that they are women because they feel female\u2014that, as some put it, they have women\u2019s brains in men\u2019s bodies. Radical feminists reject the notion of a \u201cfemale brain.\u201d They believe that if women think and act differently from men it\u2019s because society forces them to, requiring them to be sexually attractive, nurturing, and deferential. In the words of Lierre Keith, a speaker at Radfems Respond, femininity is \u201critualized submission.\u201d In this view, gender is less an identity than a caste position. Anyone born a man retains male privilege in society; even if he chooses to live as a woman\u2014and accept a correspondingly subordinate social position\u2014the fact that he has a choice means that he can never understand what being a woman is really like. By extension, when trans women demand to be accepted as women they are simply exercising another form of male entitlement. All this enrages trans women and their allies, who point to the discrimination that trans people endure; although radical feminism is far from achieving all its goals, women have won far more formal equality than trans people have. In most states, it\u2019s legal to fire someone for being transgender, and transgender people can\u2019t serve in the military. A recent survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force found overwhelming levels of anti-trans violence and persecution. Forty-one per cent of respondents said that they had attempted suicide. Yet, at the same time, the trans-rights movement is growing in power and cachet: a recent Time cover featuring the actress Laverne Cox was headlined \u201cTHE TRANSGENDER TIPPING POINT.\u201d The very word \u201ctransgender,\u201d which first came into wide use in the nineteen-nineties, encompasses far more people than the term \u201ctranssexual\u201d did. It includes not just the small number of people who seek gender-reassignment surgery\u2014according to frequently cited estimates, about one in thirty thousand men and one in a hundred thousand women\u2014but also those who take hormones, or who simply identify with the opposite gender, or, in some cases, with both or with neither. (According to the National Center survey, most trans women have taken female hormones, but only about a quarter of them have had genital surgery.) The elasticity of the term \u201ctransgender\u201d has forced a rethinking of what sex and gender mean; at least in progressive circles, what\u2019s determinative isn\u2019t people\u2019s chromosomes or their genitals or the way that they were brought up but how they see themselves. Having rejected this supposition, radical feminists now find themselves in a position that few would have imagined when the conflict began: shunned as reactionaries on the wrong side of a sexual-rights issue. It is, to them, a baffling political inversion. Radfems Respond was originally to have taken place across town from the library, at a Quaker meeting house, but trans activists had launched a petition on Change\n\nquestion: What government position did Robin Morgan hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1058}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They said that, in hosting it, the Quakers would alienate trans people and \u201cbe complicit in the violence against them.\u201d The Quakers, citing concerns in their community, revoked the agreement. It wasn\u2019t the first time that such an event had lost a scheduled venue. The Radfem 2012 conference was to be held in London, at Conway Hall, which bills itself as \u201ca hub for free speech and independent thought.\u201d But trans activists objected both to Radfem\u2019s women-only policy\u2014which was widely understood to exclude trans women\u2014and to the participation of Sheila Jeffreys, a professor of political science at the University of Melbourne. Jeffreys was scheduled to speak on prostitution, but she is a longtime critic of the transgender movement, and Conway Hall officials decided that they could not allow speakers who \u201cconflict with our ethos, principles, and culture.\u201d Ultimately, the event was held at a still secret location; organizers escorted delegates to it from a nearby meeting place. Radfem 2013 also had to switch locations, as did a gathering in Toronto last year, called Radfems Rise Up. In response, thirty-seven radical feminists, including major figures from the second wave, such as Ti-Grace Atkinson, Kathie Sarachild, and Michele Wallace, signed a statement titled \u201cForbidden Discourse: The Silencing of Feminist Criticism of \u2018Gender,\u2019 \u201d which described their \u201calarm\u201d at \u201cthreats and attacks, some of them physical, on individuals and organizations daring to challenge the currently fashionable concept of gender.\u201d With all this in mind, the Radfems Respond organizers had arranged the library space as a backup, but then a post on Portland Indymedia announced: We questioned the library administration about allowing a hate group who promotes discrimination and their response is that they cannot kick them out because of freedom of speech. So we also exercise our right to free speech in public space this Saturday to drive the TERFS and Radfems out of OUR library and OUR Portland! (TERF stands for \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminist.\u201d The term can be useful for making a distinction with radical feminists who do not share the same position, but those at whom it is directed consider it a slur.) Abusive posts proliferated on Twitter and, especially, Tumblr. One read, \u201c/kill/terfs 2K14.\u201d Another suggested, \u201chow about \u2018slowly and horrendously murder terfs in saw-like torture machines and contraptions\u2019 2K14.\u201d A young blogger holding a knife posted a selfie with the caption \u201cFetch me a terf.\u201d Such threats have become so common that radical-feminist Web sites have taken to cataloguing them. \u201cIt\u2019s aggrieved entitlement,\u201d Lierre Keith told me. \u201cThey are so angry that we will not see them as women.\u201d Keith is a writer and an activist who runs a small permaculture farm in Northern California. She is forty-nine, with cropped pewter hair and a uniform of black T-shirts and jeans. Three years ago, she co-founded the ecofeminist group Deep Green Resistance, which has some two hundred members and links the oppression of women to the pillaging of the planet. D.G.R. is defiantly militant, refusing to condemn the use of violence in the service of goals it considers just. In radical circles, though, what makes the group truly controversial is its stance on gender. As members see it, a person born with male privilege can no more shed it through surgery than a white person can claim an African-American identity simply by darkening his or her skin. Before D.G.R. held its first conference, in 2011, in Wisconsin, the group informed a person in the process of a male-to-female transition that she couldn\u2019t stay in the women\u2019s quarters. \u201cWe said, That\u2019s fine if you want to come, but, no, you\u2019re not going to have access to the women\u2019s sleeping spaces and the women\u2019s bathrooms,\u201d Keith told me. Last February, Keith was to be a keynote speaker at the Public Interest Environmental Law Conference, at the University of Oregon, in Eugene, but the student government voted to condemn her, and more than a thousand people signed a petition demanding that the address be cancelled. Amid threats of violence, six policemen escorted Keith to the lectern, though, in the end, the protest proved peaceful: some audience members walked out and held a rally, leaving her to speak to a half-empty room. Keith had an easier time at Radfems Respond, where she spoke on the differences between radicalism and liberalism.

A men\u2019s-rights activist showed up\u2014he later posted mocking clips from a video that he had secretly made\u2014but said nothing during the sessions. Several trans women arrived and sat at the back, but, in fact, they were there to express solidarity, having decided that the attacks on radical feminists were both out of control and misguided. One of them, a thin, forty-year-old blonde from the Bay Area, who blogs under the name Snowflake Especial, noted that all the violence against trans women that she\u2019s aware of was committed by men. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we dealing with them?\u201d she asked. Despite that surprising show of support, most of the speakers felt embattled. Heath Atom Russell gave the closing talk. A stocky woman, with curly turquoise hair and a bluish stubble shadow on her cheeks, she wore a T-shirt that read \u201cI Survived Testosterone Poisoning.\u201d At twenty-five, she is a \u201cdetransitioner,\u201d a person who once identified as transgender but no longer does. (Expert estimates of the number of transitioners who abandon their new gender range from fewer than one per cent to as many as five per cent.) Russell, a lesbian who grew up in a conservative Baptist family in Southern California, began transitioning to male as a student at Humboldt State University, and was embraced by gender-rights groups on campus. She started taking hormones and changed her name. Then, in her senior year, she discovered \u201cUnpacking Queer Politics\u201d (2003), by Sheila Jeffreys, which critiques female-to-male transsexualism as capitulation to misogyny. At first, the book infuriated Russell, but she couldn\u2019t let go of the questions that it raised about her own identity. She had been having heart palpitations, which made her uneasy about the hormones she was taking. Nor did she ever fully believe herself to be male. At one point during her transition, she hooked up with a middle-aged trans woman. Russell knew that she was supposed to think of herself as a man with a woman, but, she said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right, and I was scared.\u201d Eventually, she proclaimed herself a woman again, and a radical feminist, though it meant being ostracized by many of her friends. She is now engaged to a woman; someone keyed the word \u201cdyke\u201d on her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s car. Russell appears in Sheila Jeffreys\u2019s new book, \u201cGender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism.\u201d Jeffreys, who is sixty-six, has short silver hair and a weathered face. She has taught at the University of Melbourne for twenty-three years, but she grew up in London, and has been described as the Andrea Dworkin of the U.K. She has written nine previous books, all of which focus on the sexual subjugation of women, whether through rape, incest, pornography, prostitution, or Western beauty norms. Like Dworkin, she is viewed as a heroine by a cadre of like-minded admirers and as a zealot by others. In 2005, in an admiring feature in the Guardian, Julie Bindel wrote, \u201cJeffreys sees sexuality as the basis of the oppression of women by men, in much the same way as Marx saw capitalism as the scourge of the working class. This unwavering belief has made her many enemies. Postmodern theorist Judith Halberstam once said, \u2018If Sheila Jeffreys did not exist, Camille Paglia would have had to invent her.\u2019 \u201d In eight brisk chapters (half of them written with Jeffreys\u2019s former Ph.D. student Lorene Gottschalk), \u201cGender Hurts\u201d offers Jeffreys\u2019s first full-length treatment of transgenderism. Ordinarily, Jeffreys told me, she would launch the publication of a new book with an event at the university, but this time campus security warned against it. She has also taken her name off her office door. She gave a talk in London this month, but it was invitation-only. In the book, Jeffreys calls detransitioners like Russell \u201csurvivors,\u201d and cites them as evidence that transgenderism isn\u2019t immutable and thus doesn\u2019t warrant radical medical intervention. (She considers gender-reassignment surgery a form of mutilation.) \u201cThe phenomenon of regret undermines the idea that there exists a particular kind of person who is genuinely and essentially transgender and can be identified accurately by psychiatrists,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is radically destabilising to the transgender project.\u201d She cites as further evidence the case of Bradley Cooper, who, in 2011, at the age of seventeen, became Britain\n\nquestion: What government position did Robin Morgan hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1053}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Jeffreys is especially alarmed by doctors in Europe, Australia, and the United States who treat transgender children with puberty-delaying drugs, which prevent them from developing unwanted secondary sex characteristics and can result in sterilization. Throughout the book, Jeffreys insists on using male pronouns to refer to trans women and female ones to refer to trans men. \u201cUse by men of feminine pronouns conceals the masculine privilege bestowed upon them by virtue of having been placed in and brought up in the male sex caste,\u201d she writes. To her critics, the book becomes particularly hateful when she tries to account for the reality of trans people. Explaining female-to-male transition is fairly easy for her (and for other radical feminists): women seek to become men in order to raise their status in a sexist system. Heath Atom Russell, for example, is quoted as attributing her former desire to become a man to the absence of a \u201cproud woman loving culture.\u201d But, if that\u2019s true, why would men demote themselves to womanhood? For reasons of sexual fetishism, Jeffreys says. She substantiates her argument with the highly controversial theories of Ray Blanchard, a retired professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the related work of J. Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University. Contrary to widespread belief, Blanchard says, the majority of trans women in the West start off not as effeminate gay men but as straight or bisexual men, and they are initially motivated by erotic compulsion rather than by any conceived female identity. \u201cThe core is, it\u2019s really exciting for guys to imagine themselves with female breasts, or female breasts and a vulva,\u201d he told me. To describe the syndrome, Blanchard coined the term \u201cautogynephilia,\u201d meaning sexual arousal at the thought of oneself as female. Blanchard is far from a radical feminist. He believes that gender-reassignment surgery can relieve psychological suffering; he has even counselled people who undergo it. He also accepts the commonly held view that male brains differ from female brains in ways that affect behavior. Nevertheless, Jeffreys believes that the work of Blanchard and Bailey shows that when trans women ask to be accepted as women they\u2019re seeking to have an erotic fixation indulged. The last time a feminist of any standing published an attack on transgenderism as caustic as \u201cGender Hurts\u201d was in 1979, when Janice Raymond produced \u201cThe Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.\u201d Raymond was a lesbian ex-nun who became a doctoral student of the radical-feminist theologian Mary Daly, at Boston College. Inspired by the women\u2019s-health movement, Raymond framed much of \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d as a critique of a patriarchal medical and psychiatric establishment. Still, the book was frequently febrile, particularly with regard to lesbian trans women. \u201cAll transsexuals rape women\u2019s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves,\u201d Raymond wrote. \u201cHowever, the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist violates women\u2019s sexuality and spirit.\u201d It\u2019s a measure of how much perceptions have changed in the past thirty-five years that \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d received a respectful, even admiring hearing in the mainstream media, unlike \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d which has been largely ignored there. Reviewing \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d in the Times, the psychiatrist Thomas Szasz called it \u201cflawless.\u201d Raymond, he wrote, \u201chas rightly seized on transsexualism as an emblem of modern society\u2019s unremitting\u2014though increasingly concealed\u2014antifeminism.\u201d One of the women Raymond wrote about was Sandy Stone, a performance artist and academic who this fall will teach digital arts and new media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. When Raymond\u2019s book was published, Stone was a recording engineer at Olivia Records, a women\u2019s-music collective in Los Angeles. In the late sixties, after graduating from college, and while still living as a man, she had bluffed her way into a job at New York\u2019s famed Record Plant recording studio, where she worked with Jimi Hendrix and the Velvet Underground. (For a time, she slept in the studio basement, on a pile of Hendrix\u2019s capes.) She moved to the West Coast and transitioned in 1974. Olivia approached her soon afterward; experienced female recording engineers were hard to find. Stone became a member of the collective the next year and moved into a communal house that it rented, where she was the only trans woman among a dozen or so other lesbians. According to\n\nquestion: What government position did Robin Morgan hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1052}, "You are an answer-extraction expert. Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Actresses of \"Kiss and Tell\" and their Government Positions\n\nevidence:  \u201cThe Transsexual Empire,\u201d her presence was a major source of controversy in lesbian-feminist circles, but Stone insists that it was Raymond who created the dissension. \u201cWhen the book came out, we were deluged with hate mail,\u201d Stone says. \u201cUp to that point, we were pretty much happy campers, making our music and doing our political work.\u201d Stone received death threats, but ultimately it was the threat of a boycott that drove her out of the collective. She eventually earned a doctorate in philosophy at Santa Cruz. In 1987, Stone wrote an essay, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto,\u201d which is widely seen as the founding text of transgender studies. It\u2019s still taught around the world; a second French edition is about to be published, and Stone has received a request to allow a Catalan translation. The last time that Janice Raymond wrote on transgender issues was in 1994, for a new introduction to \u201cThe Transsexual Empire.\u201d Since then, she has focussed on sex trafficking, and last August a Norwegian government agency invited her to Oslo to speak on a panel about prostitution legislation. When she arrived, however, an official informed her that she had been disinvited; a letter to the editor of a major Norwegian newspaper had accused her of transphobia. Raymond says that similar things have \u201chappened much more frequently within the last couple of years.\u201d The most dramatic change in the perception of transgenderism can be seen in academia. Particularly at liberal-arts colleges, students are now routinely asked which gender pronoun they would prefer to be addressed by: choices might include \u201cze,\u201d \u201cou,\u201d \u201chir,\u201d \u201cthey,\u201d or even \u201cit.\u201d A decade ago, no university offered a student health plan that covered gender-reassignment surgery. Today, dozens do, including Harvard, Brown, Duke, Yale, Stanford, and the schools in the University of California system. There are young transgender-critical radical feminists, like Heath Atom Russell and Rachel Ivey, aged twenty-four, who was one of the organizers of Radfems Respond, but they are the first to admit that they\u2019re a minority. \u201cIf I were to say in a typical women\u2019s-studies class today, \u2018Female people are oppressed on the basis of reproduction,\u2019 I would get called out,\u201d Ivey says. Other students, she adds, would ask, \u201cWhat about women who are male?\u201d That might be an exaggeration, but only a slight one. The members of the board of the New York Abortion Access Fund, an all-volunteer group that helps to pay for abortions for those who can\u2019t afford them, are mostly young women; Alison Turkos, the group\u2019s co-chair, is twenty-six. In May, they voted unanimously to stop using the word \u201cwomen\u201d when talking about people who get pregnant, so as not to exclude trans men. \u201cWe recognize that people who identify as men can become pregnant and seek abortions,\u201d the group\u2019s new Statement of Values says. A Change.org petition asks NARAL and Planned Parenthood to adopt similarly gender-inclusive language. It specifically criticizes the hashtag #StandWithTexasWomen, which ricocheted around Twitter during State Senator Wendy Davis\u2019s filibuster against an anti-abortion bill in her state, and the phrase \u201cTrust Women,\u201d which was the slogan of George Tiller, the doctor and abortion provider who was murdered in Wichita in 2009. To some younger activists, it seems obvious that anyone who objects to such changes is simply clinging to the privilege inherent in being cisgender, a word popularized in the nineteen-nineties to mean any person who is not transgender. Alison Turkos has heard complaints that the new language obscures the fact that cisgender women overwhelmingly bear the brunt of the current political attacks on reproductive rights. She replies, \u201cIt may not feel comfortable, but it\u2019s important to create a space for more people who are often denied space and visibility.\u201d Older feminists who have not yet adopted this way of thinking can find themselves experiencing ideological whiplash. Sara St. Martin Lynne, a forty-year-old filmmaker and video producer from Oakland, told me, \u201cWhen you come from a liberation, leftist background, you want to be on the right side of history,\u201d and the debate \u201ckind of puts you through your paces.\u201d Last year, she was asked to resign from the board of Bay Area Girls Rock Camp, a nonprofit that \u201cempowers girls through music,\u201d because of her involvement with the Michigan Womyn\u2019s Music Festival, which bills itself as an event for \u201cwomyn-born womyn\n\nquestion: What government position did Robin Morgan hold?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1029}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Michfest, as it\u2019s called, takes place every August, on six hundred and fifty acres of land in the woods east of Lake Michigan. Lisa Vogel founded it in 1976, when she was a nineteen-year-old Central Michigan University student, and she still runs it. The music, Vogel says, is only part of what makes Michfest important. Each year, several thousand women set up camp there and find themselves, for a week, living in a matriarchy. Meals are cooked in kitchen tents and eaten communally. There are workshops and classes. Some women don extravagant costumes; others wear nothing at all. There is free child care and a team to assist disabled women who ordinarily cannot go camping. Vogel describes the governing ethos as \u201cHow would a town look if we actually got to decide what was important?\u201d She told me, \u201cThere\u2019s something that I experience on the land when I walk at night without a flashlight in the woods and recognize that for that moment I feel completely safe. And there\u2019s nowhere else I can do that.\u201d She continued, \u201cIf, tomorrow, we said everyone is welcome, I\u2019m sure it would still be a really cool event, but that piece that allows women to let down their guard and feel that really deep sense of personal liberation would be different, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about.\u201d To transgender activists, Vogel\u2019s stance is laden with offensive assumptions: that trans women are different in an essential way from other women, and that they\u2019re dangerous. \u201cThe trope of trans women\u201d constituting \u201ca threat to women\u2019s spaces has been tossed around forever,\u201d Julia Serano told me. To her, it\u2019s akin to straight people refusing to share a locker room with gays or lesbians. Serano, forty-six, is a biologist by training who now spends most of her time writing and speaking on transgender issues and feminism; last year, she lectured at schools including Brown, Stanford, Smith, and Cornell. (Sheila Jeffreys attacks her in \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d using autobiographical details from Serano\u2019s first book, \u201cWhipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity\u201d (2007), to paint her as an autogynephile who seeks to \u201creinvent \u2018feminism\u2019 to fit his erotic interests.\u201d) In the summer of 2003, Serano joined about a hundred people at Camp Trans, a protest camp near the Michfest site, which has run intermittently since 1994. Serano said that relations with Michfest attendees were often unexpectedly cordial. A few years ago, though, Vogel says, some protesters committed acts of vandalism\u2014stealing electrical cables, cutting water pipes, keying cars in the parking lot, and spray-painting a six-foot penis, and the words \u201cReal Women Have Dicks,\u201d on the side of the main kitchen tent. Since then, as with the case of Olivia Records, the demonstrations have been supplanted by a boycott campaign. Last year, the Indigo Girls, longtime regulars at Michfest, announced that they wouldn\u2019t appear again until the event became trans-inclusive. This year, the scheduled headliners, Hunter Valentine, pulled out for the same reason. Performers who do appear face protests and boycotts of their own; the funk singer Shelley Nicole says that her band, blaKb\u00fcshe, was dropped from a show in Brooklyn because it is playing at Michfest next month. Before Sara St. Martin Lynne was asked to leave the Bay Area Girls Rock Camp board, she hadn\u2019t identified closely with radical feminism. Yet, as the campaign against Michfest\u2014and against radical feminism as a whole\u2014has grown, she\u2019s come to feel strongly about keeping the event \u201cwomyn-born-womyn.\u201d She said, \u201cThis moment where we\u2019re losing the ability to say the word \u2018woman\u2019 or to acknowledge the fact that being born female has lived consequences and meaning is kind of intense to me.\u201d One of the trans women who showed up at the Radfems Respond conference, a thirty-five-year-old software engineer from California, with a tiny nose stud and long brown hair, agrees. She understands why trans women are hurt by their exclusion from Michfest and other female-only events and facilities, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not really wanting to invade space. It\u2019s a deep-seated wanting to belong.\u201d But, she adds, \u201cif you\u2019re identifying with women, shouldn\u2019t you be empathizing with women?\u201d Sandy Stone shares this view\u2014up to a point.

Although it was CBS's answer to NBC's A Date with Judy, it was also broadcast by NBC in 1948 as a summer replacement for The Bob Hope Show. From October 3, 1952, to June 26, 1953, it aired on ABC, finally returning to CBS. Despite the program's long run, fewer than 24 episodes are known to exist. Priscilla Lyon and Janet Waldo successively portrayed 15-year-old Corliss on radio. Lugene Sanders also played Corliss briefly on radio and in the CBS version of the Meet Corliss Archer television show. Perpetually perky, breathless and well-intentioned, Corliss is constantly at the side of her next-door neighbor and boyfriend, Dexter Franklin (Bill Christy, Sam Edwards). Clumsy, nerdy Dexter, a sweet but constant bungler with a nasal voice, is best remembered for his trademark phrase, \"Holy cow!\" and his braying call, \"Heyyyy, Corrrrrliiiiiss!\"\u2014frequently delivered from the hedge separating their houses. Harry Archer, Corliss's father, is a lawyer who tolerates Dexter only when he wants to use him to help flaunt male superiority. Gruff but gentle, he was played by Bob Bailey, Fred Shields and Frank Martin. Janet Archer, Corliss's mother, was played by, successively, Irene Tedrow, Monty Margetts and Gloria Holden. She is calm and understanding with her daughter and her husband, both of whom sometimes try her patience. Other frequent characters include Mildred Ames, a good friend of Corliss (played by Bebe Young and Barbara Whiting); Mildred's irritating younger brother Raymond (Tommy Bernard, Kenny Godkin); and Corliss's rival, Betty Cameron (Delores Crane). Meet Corliss Archer was written by F. Hugh Herbert, who first introduced the character and her friends in a Good Housekeeping magazine story \"A Private Affair,\" the first of a series of stories. Kiss and Tell was a 1943 play that was adapted for a 1945 film starring Shirley Temple. The 1949 sequel, A Kiss for Corliss, was re-released in 1954. Herbert's Meet Corliss Archer property was adapted to television in 1951 and 1952 with live broadcasts produced and aired by CBS. In 1954 and 1955 Ziv Television Programs produced a syndicated telefilm series starring Ann Baker and Mary Brian. One of the show's unique features was the occasional cut to a comic-book-style drawing, with announcer's commentary, that illustrated the current story situation and was used several times during each episode. The program was produced by Ziv Productions. Several episodes of the Ziv version are available on DVD, and some are also available from the Internet Archive. Robin Morgan portrayed Corliss in a live telecast of Kiss and Tell on The Alcoa Hour (August 5, 1956), with Warren Berlinger as Dexter. Radio listeners had to use their imaginations to visualize Corliss, her friends and her town. But those imaginations got a boost in 1948 when the Meet Corliss Archer comic book, published by Fox Feature Syndicate, came out in three issues from March to July 1948. Al Feldstein (Albert B. Feldstein), later the editor of Mad, was a key writer and illustrator of this short-lived comic book series, which is now remembered primarily for his artwork in general and the good girl art covers in particular. Film strips and radio microphones on the front cover indicated the tie-ins and media crossovers. Janet Waldo was depicted on the front cover twice, as herself and as Corliss.\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan known for?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "portraying Corliss", "usage": 901}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since the early 1960s, she has been a key radical feminist member of the American Women's Movement, and a leader in the international feminist movement. Her 1970 anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful was cited by the New York Public Library as \"One of the 100 Most Influential Books of the 20th Century.\". She has written more than 20 books of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, and was editor of Ms. magazine. During the 1960s, she participated in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements; in the late 1960s, she was a founding member of radical feminist organizations such as New York Radical Women and W.I.T.C.H. She founded or co-founded the Feminist Women's Health Network, the National Battered Women's Refuge Network, Media Women, the National Network of Rape Crisis Centers, the Feminist Writers' Guild, the Women's Foreign Policy Council, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, GlobalSister.org, and Greenstone Women's Radio Network. She also co-founded the Women's Media Center with activist Gloria Steinem and actor/activist Jane Fonda. In 2018, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women. Due to circumstances at her birth, her mother claimed that Robin Morgan was born a year later than she actually was (see birth and parents), and throughout her career as a child actor, she was thought to be a year younger than she actually was, both by herself and others. Already as a toddler, her mother, Faith, and mother's sister Sally started Robin as a child model. At the age of five, believed to be four, she got her own program, titled Little Robin Morgan, on the New York radio station WOR. She was also a regular on the original network radio version of Juvenile Jury. Her acting career took off when she was eight and started in the TV series Mama, as Dagmar Hansen, the younger sister in the family depicted in the series. The show premiered on CBS in 1949, starring Peggy Wood, and was a great success. Morgan played Cecchina Cabrini in Citizen Saint (1947). During the Golden Age of Television, Morgan starred in such \"TV spectaculars\" as Kiss and Tell and Alice in Wonderland, and guest starred on such live dramas as Omnibus, Suspense, Danger, Hallmark Hall of Fame, Robert Montgomery Presents, Tales of Tomorrow, and Kraft Theatre. She worked with directors such as Sidney Lumet, John Frankenheimer, Ralph Nelson; writers such as Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling; and performed with actors such as Boris Karloff, Rosalind Russell, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, and Cliff Robertson. Having wanted to write rather than to act since she was four, Morgan fought her mother's efforts to keep her in show business, and left the cast of Mama at age 14. As she entered adulthood, Robin Morgan continued her education as a non-matriculating student at Columbia University. She began working as a secretary at Curtis Brown Literary Agency, where she met and worked with such writers as poet W. H. Auden in the early 1960s. She had already begun publishing her own poetry (later collected in her first book of poems, Monster, published in 1972). Throughout the next decades, along with political activism, writing fiction and nonfiction prose, and lecturing at colleges and universities on women's rights, Morgan continued to write and publish poetry. In 1962, Morgan married poet Kenneth Pitchford. She gave birth to their son, Blake Morgan, in 1969. The couple divorced in 1983. At that time, she was working as an editor at Grove Press and was involved in an attempt to unionize the publishing industry. When Grove summarily fired her and other union sympathizers, she led a seizure and occupation of their offices in the spring of 1970, protesting the union-busting, as well as the dishonest accounting of royalties to Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow. Morgan and eight other women were arrested that day. In the mid-1970s Morgan became a Contributing Editor to Ms. magazine, and continued her affiliation there as a part- or full-time editor in the following decades. She served as editor-in-chief of the magazine from 1989 to 1994, turning it into a highly successful, ad-free, bimonthly, international publication, which won awards for both writing and design, and received considerable acclaim among journalists. In 1979, when the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed, featuring famous women from politics, media and entertainment, culture, sports, and other areas of achievement, one of the cards featured Morgan's name and picture. Today, the trading cards are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the University of Iowa library. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan known for?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Child actor and writer.", "usage": 1139}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Seven years later, in 2012, she debuted a weekly radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live With Robin Morgan. The broadcast is syndicated in the US and, as a podcast, is published online at the WMCLive website, and distributed on iTunes in 110 countries. It has been praised by The Huffington Post as \"talk radio with a brain\" and features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. The weekly hour was picked up by CBS Radio two weeks after its launch and is broadcast on CBS affiliate WJFK each Saturday. The program features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. By 1962 Morgan had become active in the anti-war Left, and had also contributed articles and poetry to such Left-wing and counter-culture journals as Liberation, Rat, Win, and The National Guardian. In the 1960s she became increasingly involved in social-justice movements, notably the civil-rights and anti-Vietnam war. In early 1967, she was active in the Youth International Party (known in the media as the \"Yippies\"), with Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner. However, tensions over sexism within the YIP (and the New Left in general) came to a head when Morgan grew more involved in Women's Liberation and contemporary feminism. In 1967, Morgan became a founding member of the short-lived New York Radical Women group. She was the key organizer of their September 1968 inaugural protest of the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City. Morgan wrote the Miss America protest pamphlet No More Miss America!, and that same year cofounded Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.), a radical feminist group that used public street theater (called \"hexes\" or \"zaps\") to call attention to sexism. Morgan designed the universal symbol of the women\u2019s movement\u2013\u2013the female symbol, a circle with a cross beneath, centered with a raised fist. The Oxford English Dictionary also credits her with first using the term \"herstory\" in print in her 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful. Concerning the feminist organization W.I.T.C.H., Morgan wrote: With the royalties from her anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful, Morgan founded the first feminist grant-giving foundation in the US: The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, which provided seed money to many early women's groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s. She made a decisive break from what she described as the \"male Left\" when she led the women's takeover of the underground newspaper Rat in 1970, and listed the reasons for her break in the first women's issue of the paper, in her essay titled \"Goodbye to All That\". The essay gained notoriety in the press for naming specific sexist men and institutions in the Left. Decades later, during the Democratic primaries for the 2008 presidential race, Morgan wrote a fiery sequel to her original essay, titled \"Goodbye To All That #2\", in defense of Hillary Clinton. The article quickly went viral on the internet for lambasting sexist rhetoric directed towards Clinton by the media. In 1977, Morgan became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Morgan has traveled extensively across the United States and around the world to bring attention to cross-cultural sexism. She has met with and interviewed female rebel fighters in the Philippines, Brazilian women activists in the slums/favelas of Rio, women organizers in the townships of South Africa, and underground feminists in Iran. Twice\u2013\u2013in 1986 and 1989 she spent months in the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, West Bank, and Gaza, to report on the conditions of women. Morgan has also spoken at universities and institutions in countries across Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America, as well as in Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. Over the years, Morgan has received numerous awards for her activism on women\u2019s rights. The Feminist Majority Foundation named Robin Morgan \"Woman of the Year\" in 1990; she received the Warrior Woman Award for Promoting Racial Understanding from The Asian American Women's National Organization in 1992; in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now, and in 2003 The Feminist Press gave her a \"Femmy\" Award for her \"service to literature\". She has also received the Humanist Heroine Award from The American Humanist Association in 2007. In March 2012 Morgan, along with her Women's Media Center co-founders Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem, wrote an open letter asking listeners to request\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan known for?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "She was a key organizer of the September 1968 Miss America pageant protest, co-founder of Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.), and founder of The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund which provided seed money to many early women's groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s.", "usage": 1199}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They asked that stations licensed for public airwaves carrying Limbaugh be held accountable for contravening public interest as a continual promoter of hate speech against various disempowered and minority groups. In 1970, Morgan compiled, edited, and introduced the first anthology of feminist writings, Sisterhood is Powerful. The compilation included now-classic feminist essays by such activists as Naomi Weisstein, Kate Millett, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Florynce Kennedy, Frances M. Beal, Joreen, Marge Piercy, Lucinda Cisler and Mary Daly, as well as historical documents including the N.O.W. Bill of Rights, excerpts from the SCUM Manifesto, the Redstockings Manifesto, historical documents from W.I.T.C.H., and a germinal statement from the Black Women\u2019s Liberation Group of Mount Vernon. It also included what Morgan called \"verbal karate\": useful quotes and statistics about women. The anthology was cited by the New York Public Library as one of the \u201cNew York Public Library's Books of the  Century\u201d. Morgan established the first American feminist grant-giving organization, The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, with the royalties from Sisterhood Is Powerful. However, the anthology was banned in Chile, China, and South Africa. Her follow-up volume in 1984, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology, compiled articles about women in over seventy countries. That same year she founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, notable for being the first international feminist think tank. Repeatedly refusing the post of president, she was elected secretary of the organization from 1989 to 1993, was VP from 1993 to 1997, and after serving on the advisory board, finally agreed to become president in 2004. A third volume, Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium in 2003, was a collection of articles mostly by well-known feminists, both young and \"vintage\", in a retrospective on and future blueprint for the feminist movement. It was compiled, edited, and with an introduction by Morgan, and Morgan wrote \"To Vintage Feminists\" and \"To Younger Women\", which were both included in the anthology as Personal Postscripts. Morgan's articles, essays, reviews, interviews, political analyses, and investigative journalism have appeared widely in such publications as The Atlantic, Broadsheet, Chrysalis, Essence, Everywoman, The Feminist Art Journal, The Guardian (US), The Guardian (UK), The Hudson Review, the Los Angeles Times, Ms., The New Republic, The New York Times, Off Our Backs, Pacific Ways, The Second Wave, Sojourner, The Village Voice, The Voice of Women, and various United Nations periodicals, etc. Articles and essays have also appeared in reprint in international media, in English across the Commonwealth, and in translation in 13 languages in Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. Morgan has served as a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for many years, receiving the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism for her cover story titled \"The First Feminist Exiles from the USSR\" in 1981. She served as the magazine's editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, re-launching it as an ad-free, international bimonthly publication in 1991. This earned her a series of awards, including the award for Editorial Excellence by Utne Reader in 1991, and the Exceptional Merit in Journalism Award by the National Women's Political Caucus. Morgan resigned her post in 1994 to become Consulting Global Editor of the magazine, which she remains to this day. Morgan has written for online audiences and blogged frequently. Among her best known articles are \"Letters from Ground Zero\" (written and posted after the September 11 attacks in 2001 \u2014 which went viral), \"Goodbye To All That #2\", \"Women of the Arab Spring\", \"When Bad News is Good News: Notes of a Feminist News Junkie\", \"Manhood and Moral Waivers\", and \"Faith Healing: A Modest Proposal on Religious Fundamentalism\". Her online work is hosted in the archives of the Women's Media Center. Robin Morgan has published 21 books, including works of poetry, fiction, and the now-classic anthologies Sisterhood Is Powerful, Sisterhood Is Global, and Sisterhood Is Forever. Well before she was known as a feminist leader, literary magazines published her as a serious poet. According to a 1972 review of her first book of poems, Monster, in The Washington Post: \" establish Morgan as a poet of considerable means. There is a savage elegance, a richness of vocabulary, a thrust and steely polish..... A powerful, challenging book.\" In 1979 Morgan received a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in poetry,\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan known for?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "She is a feminist leader.", "usage": 1141}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

During this time she worked on a cycle of verse plays. Morgan\u2019s poetry collections include A Hot January: Poems 1996\u20131999 (W. W. Norton, 1999), Depth Perception: New Poems and a Masque (Doubleday, 1994), Upstairs in the Garden: Poems Selected and New 1968\u20131988 (W. W. Norton, 1990), Death Benefits (Copper Canyon Press, 1981), Lady of the Beasts (Random House, 1976), and Monster (Random House, 1972). Of the book A Hot January, Alice Walker wrote: \"Morgan proves that exquisite poetry can be the most surprising gift of grief. A volume as proud, fierce, vulnerable, and brave as the poet herself.\" A review of Upstairs in the Garden, noted: \"As a vindication and celebration of the female experience, these inventive poems successfully wed feminist rhetoric with vivid imagery and sensitivity to the music of language.\" Two books of poems, Lady of the Beasts and Depth Perception, earned reviews in Poetry Magazine with critic Jay Parini stating that \"Robin Morgan will soon be regarded as one of our first-ranking poets.\" Morgan had published three books of fiction as of 2015. Her debut novel was the semi-autobiographical Dry Your Smile (published by Doubleday & Company, 1987), followed by The Mer-Child: A Legend for Children and Other Adults (published by The Feminist Press at City University of New York, 1991). Her most recent work of fiction is a historical novel titled The Burning Time (Melville House Books, 2006), set in the 14th century, based on court records of the first witchcraft trial in Ireland. The Burning Time was placed on the Recommended Quality Fiction List of 2007 by the American Library Association, in addition to being the 2006 Paperback Pick by Book Sense (The American Booksellers Association). Morgan has compiled, edited, and introduced several influential anthologies: Sisterhood Is Powerful: The Women\u2019s Liberation Anthology (1970), Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), and Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003). She has herself written non-fiction, including Going Too Far (1978), The Anatomy of Freedom (1984), The Demon Lover: On the Sexuality of Terrorism (1989), The Word of a Woman (1994), and Saturday\u2019s Child: A Memoir (2001). One of the most widely translated of Morgan\u2019s books and a best-seller, The Demon Lover is a commentary on the psychological and political roots of terrorism, and New York Times Book Review called it \"Important...compelling.... is intense and at times magnificent.\" Her most recently published book of non-fiction is Fighting Words: A Tool Kit for Combating the Religious Right (2006). In 1984, Morgan, together with the late Simone de Beauvoir of France, and women from 80 other countries, founded The Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI), an international non-profit NGO with consultative status to the United Nations, which has for three decades functioned as the world\u2019s first feminist think-tank. The Institute has played a leading policy-formulation, strategic, and activist role in the evolution of the international Women\u2019s Movement. SIGI has also developed a global communications network through which an umbrella of NGO interest, advice, contacts, and support is collectively mobilized to empower the global women\u2019s movement. Among its many activities, the Institute pioneered the first Urgent Acton Alerts regarding women\u2019s rights; the first Global Campaign To Make Visible Women\u2019s Unpaid Labor In National Accounts; and the first Women\u2019s Rights Manuals For Muslim Societies (in 12 languages). Its most recent project is Donor Direct Action (donordirectaction.org), which links front-line women\u2019s rights activists around the world to money, visibility, and popular support: minimum bureaucracy, maximum impact. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit progressive organization, The Women\u2019s Media Center with her friends actor/activist Jane Fonda, and activist Gloria Steinem. The focus of the organization is to make women powerful and visible in the media. An invited speaker at numerous universities in North America, Morgan has traveled\u2014as organizer, speaker, journalist\u2014across North America, Europe, and the Middle East to Australia, Brazil, the Caribbean, Central America, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. She has also been a guest professor or scholar in residence at a variety of academic institutions. She was guest chair for feminist studies at the New College of Florida in 1971; a visiting professor at The Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture at Rutgers University in 1987; a distinguished visiting scholar in residence for literary and cultural studies at the University of Canterbury, Christ\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan known for?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Her most recent work of fiction is a historical novel titled The Burning Time", "usage": 1132}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She was awarded an honorary degree as a Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs in 1992. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection that documents the personal, political, and professional aspects of Morgan's life, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. They date from the 1940s to the present. Robin Morgan has been arrested, and has received death threats from both the Right and the Left because of her activism. According to a New Yorker magazine article published in the aftermath of Morgan's essay \"Goodbye to All That\" (#2) going viral on the Internet, \"At five feet tall Morgan is, not for the first time, the little woman who has started a big war.\" In her original essay, \"Goodbye to All That\" (1970), Morgan bade adieu to \"the dream that being in the leadership collective will get you anything but gonorrhea,\" referring to the \"male Left\". She also asserted that Charles Manson was \"only the logical extreme of the normal American male\u2019s fantasy.\" Two years later, Morgan published the poem \"Arraignment\", in which she openly accused Ted Hughes of the battery and murder of Sylvia Plath. There were lawsuits, Morgan's 1972 book Monster which contained that poem was banned, and underground, pirated feminist editions of it were published. As the leading organizer of the 1968 protest of the Miss America Pageant, \"No More Miss America!\", Morgan attacked the pageant\u2019s \"ludicrous 'beauty' standards and also accused the pageant of being racist, since at that time no African American woman had been a contestant. In addition\u2013\u2013according to Morgan\u2013\u2013in sending pageant winners to entertain troops in Vietnam, the women served as \"death mascots\" in an immoral war. Morgan asked, \"Where else could one find such a perfect combination of American values -- racism, militarism, capitalism -- all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol, a woman.\" Another controversial quote is from her 1978 book, Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist, where she stated: \"I feel that \"man-hating\" is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.\" Morgan famously walked off The Tonight Show in 1969 when it screened vintage footage of her as a child actor while she was trying to speak seriously about the first national march against rape. Of the incident, she has been quoted as saying: \"Imagine talking about such a subject and having it trivialized like that.\" In 1974, with her phrase \"Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice\" (from her essay \"Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape\"), she became a central figure on one of the divisive issues in feminism, particularly among anti-pornography feminists in Anglophone countries. In 1973, Robin Morgan gave the keynote speech at the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in which she criticized Beth Elliott, a performer and organizer of the conference, for being a transgender woman. In this speech she referred to Elliott as a \"transsexual male\" and used male pronouns throughout, charging her with being \"an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer-with the mentality of a rapist.\" At the end of her speech she called for a vote on ejecting Elliott, with over two-thirds voting to allow her to remain, however the minority threatened to disrupt the conference and Elliott chose to leave after her performance to avoid this. The event demonstrated the high tension surrounding transgender women's involvement in the women's movement of the 1970s. Robin Morgan grew up in New York, first in Mount Vernon, and later in Manhattan, on Sutton Place. She graduated from The Wetter School in Mount Vernon, in 1956, and was privately tutored from then until 1959. She published her first serious poetry in literary magazines at age 17. In an article published in the Jewish Women's Archive, Morgan reveals she is of Jewish ancestry, but identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She is quoted as saying, \"When compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Ashkenazic (with a touch of Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\" Morgan continues to tackle topics such as religion, politics and sex in fiery commentaries on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan.

In 2000 Norton published Morgan\u2019s memoir, Saturday's Child, in which she wrote candidly about \"the shadowy circumstances of her birth; a lifelong, impassioned, love-hate relationship with her mother; her years as a famous child actor and her fight to escape show business to become a serious writer; her marriage to a fiery bisexual poet and how motherhood transformed her life; her years in the civil rights movement, the New Left, and counterculture; her emergence a leader of global feminism; and her love affairs with women as well as men,\" according to BookNews.com. In her book, \"her passion for writing, especially poetry, is vividly conveyed, as is her love and respect for her son, born in 1969,\" according to The New York Times Book Review. In April 2013, Morgan announced publicly that she had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, discussing the diagnosis on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan, revealing that she had been diagnosed in 2010, but that her quality of life was thus far \"normal\". Since her diagnosis, Morgan has become active with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation (PDF), completing training to become part of the organization's Parkinson's Advocates in Research initiative. In 2014 she was the catalyst and took a leadership role in PDF's new Women and PD initiative, which will seek to better serve women impacted by Parkinson's disease by understanding and resolving gender inequalities in PD research, treatment, and caregiver support. Morgan has also written new poetry inspired by her battle with the disease, and performed a reading of some of the poems as a TED Talk, at the TEDWomen 2015 conference. Her mother, Faith Berkeley Morgan, traveled from her New York residence to Florida to give birth, in order to avoid public scrutiny for her unmarried status. Robin's father, a medical doctor named Mates Morgenstern, did not accompany pregnant Faith on her trip. Until Morgan was 13 years old, her mother Faith claimed that Robin's father had been killed in World War II. However, Robin overheard conversations between her mother and aunt suggesting her father was alive. When she confronted her mother, Faith changed her story to assert that Robin's father had escaped from one Nazi concentration camp after another, and that she had saved his life by sponsoring his immigration to the United States where he had no family. Not until several years later did Robin get proof that this was also a lie. Morgan learned the truth, both about her father, who was still alive, and how old she really was, early in 1961. Now a young woman, no longer working in show business, Robin found a listing for the medical practice of an obstetrician, Dr. Mates Morgenstern, in the New Brunswick, New Jersey telephone directory. Suspecting this might be her father, she had sought a meeting with him, without her mother's knowledge, and ultimately paid a surprise visit to his New Jersey office in January 1961. Morgenstern revealed that he was aware of Robin's fame as a child actor, but had remained firm in his decision to avoid contact with Faith Morgan, having chosen not to see her again after the only time he visited her and the infant Robin. He also told Robin, during their conversation in his medical office, that she in fact was born on January 29, 1941, exactly one year earlier than she thought, and disclosed the copy of her original birth certificate, that he had stored in his office. In order to conceal the out-of-wedlock birth, Faith Morgan had asked her Florida obstetrician to sign an affidavit stating that the birth took place on January 29, 1942. During the conversation in his office, Morgenstern told his daughter that he first met her mother after his arrival in the United States, more than a year before the United States entered World War II, and that she had had nothing to do with his immigration. He added that he had known Faith only briefly and claimed that she had fantasized their relationship as more important than it was. By the time Morgan met her father he had married and had two sons with a woman he had known since they were both children in Austria. Having been separated by the war, they resumed their relationship after she arrived in the United States not long after Robin was born, which probably also added to Morgenstern's decision to abandon Faith and their daughter. Morgan only met her father once more, in February 1965 when he invited her and her husband to his New Jersey home. Morgenstern did not want his sons to know that they had a half-sister and Morgan acceded to his request that they tell his two sons that she was \"the daughter of an old friend.\" She refused to do so again, however, and never met him or her two half-brothers again. Morgan describes the two encounters that she had with her biological father in her autobiography, Saturday's Child: A Memoir.

Hugh Herbert. Kiss and Tell starred Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer and Judith Parrish as her friend Mildred Pringle. The play's great success led to offers from Hollywood for Caulfield, who left the production almost one year to the day from when it opened, and was replaced in her role by her sister Betty Caulfield. Kiss and Tell premiered at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston on March 1, 1943 for tryout performances before its Broadway run. It opened in New York City on March 17, 1943 at the Biltmore Theatre. It remained there until the end of 1944, before transferring to the Bijou Theatre in 1945. It ran for a total of 956 performances before closing on June 23, 1945. The original production was produced by George Abbott and written by F. Hugh Herbert. The cast included Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer, Jessie Royce Landis as Janet Archer, Frances Bavier as Louise, Walter Davis as Uncle George, John Harvey as Private Earhart, Lulu Mae Hubbard as Dorothy Pringle, Robert Keith as Harry Archer, James Lane as Mr. Willard, Tommy Lewis as Raymond Pringle, Robert Lynn as Robert Pringle, Judith Parrish as Mildred Pringle, Calvin Thomas as Bill Franklin, Paula Trueman as Mary Franklin, Robert White as Dexter Franklin, and Richard Widmark as Lieut. Lenny Archer. Two teenage girls become interested in boys, and the girls' parents are making more problems rather than solving them. A film version written by Herbert and based on his play was released by Columbia Pictures on October 4, 1945 with Shirley Temple in the role of Corliss Archer. The film was directed by Richard Wallace and produced by Sol C. Siegel. Temple would reprise the role in the film's sequel A Kiss for Corliss in 1949.\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan known for?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 490}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In 1962 she became active in the civil rights and feminist movements, quickly becoming a leader. She worked as a contributing editor for Ms. Magazine for twenty years, serving as editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994. Her editing of the Sisterhood anthologies (beginning with Sisterhood Is Powerful in 1970) has a significant impact on the feminist movement. In 1984 Morgan founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, a think tank for women\u2019s rights worldwide. Morgan continues to write and lecture around the world in addition to hosting a weekly radio and online podcast and webcast program entitled \u201cWomen\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan.\u201d \u201cIf I had to name a single quality characteristic of patriarchy, it would be compartmentalization, the capacity for institutionalizing disconnection. Intellect severed from emotion. Thought separated from action. Science split from art. The earth itself divided\u2014national borders.... The personal isolated from the political. Sex divorced from love\u2026Law detached from justice\u2026If I had to name a single quality characteristic of global feminism, it would be connectivity\u2014a capacity dangerous to every status quo, because of its insistence on noticing.\u201d In her lifetime battle for women\u2019s dignity and global change, Robin Morgan uses words as ammunition, as one can see in the above quotation from The Word of a Woman (1992). As poet, novelist, journalist, lecturer, and feminist theorist, she expresses the reality of contemporary women\u2019s oppression. Morgan was born on January 29, 1941, daughter of Faith Berkeley Morgan, in Lake Worth, Florida. As a child, Morgan\u2019s mother told her that her father had been killed in World War II and later told her other false stories about his identity and fate. Morgan learned the true identity of her father, an obstetrician/gynecologist named Mates Morgenstern, in 1961 when she was nineteen years old. They met only once in person in 1965. When Morgan was not yet a year old, her mother entered her in baby contests and she began a career first as a child model, and later as a child actor and radio personality. She remained a public figure, starring in primetime dramas and specials as well as working on the stage, until the age of fourteen, when she left the limelight to do what she really wanted: to write. Though she never formally enrolled in college, Morgan attended (nonmatriculated) classes and lectures at Columbia University and remained in New York City. At the age of seventeen, she published her first serious poetry in a literary magazine. In 1962, Morgan married writer Kenneth Pitchford, whom she divorced in 1990. Together they had one son, Blake Morgan-Pitchford, born in 1969. Morgan identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She writes: \u201cWhen compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Jews of European origin and their descendants, including most of North and South American Jewry.Ashkenazic (with a touch of Descendants of the Jews who lived in Spain and Portugal before the explusion of 1492; primarily Jews of N. Africa, Italy, the Middle East and the Balkans.Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. And I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\u201d Morgan became an activist during the 1960s and was involved in the civil rights movement, SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee), and the anti-Vietnam War movement. She was also a founding member of New York Radical Women and other radical feminist organizations, such as W.I.T.C.H, which she co-founded in 1968. She was one of the key organizers of the 1968 protest at Atlantic City\u2019s Miss America Contest, which helped launch the second wave of United States feminism. She later reflected on the Miss America pageant, its practices, and the 1968 protest: \u201cwhere else could one find such a perfect combination of American values\u2014racism, militarism, capitalism\u2014all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol: a woman\u201d (Word of a Woman: Feminist Dispatches, 1968-1992). In the following decades, Morgan spearheaded the international women\u2019s liberation movement through her continued activism, her steadfast publishing of feminist poetry and prose, her work as a feminist journalist and editor, and her passionate international lecturing.

Morgan also funded The Sisterhood is Powerful Fund, the first feminist foundation in the United States, with royalties from Sisterhood is Powerful. In 1970, Morgan helped lead the women\u2019s takeover of Rat, a leftist newspaper. Women staffers at the paper and previous contributors like Morgan seized the paper for an issue and never gave it back. In the first women\u2019s issue of the paper, titled \u201cWomen Seize RAT! Sabotage Tales!,\u201d Morgan published what became the famous essay, \u201cGoodbye to All That,\u201d in which she addressed sexism on the Left and \u201cLeftist men\u2019s betrayal of women.\u201d Throughout her career, Morgan has traveled far and wide to interview women rebel fighters in the Philippines, Palestinian women activists in the Intifada, and women in postrevolutionary Iran. She was a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for twenty years, serving as its editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, when it was relaunched as an advertisement-free publication. Since August 2012, Morgan has hosted a nationally syndicated weekly American radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan, in which she discusses current events, interviews guests, produces in-depth investigative reports, and offers commentary on a host of contemporary issues. Morgan has written more than twenty books, including five books of poetry, two novels, and numerous books of essays. She is best known as editor of several important anthologies. Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings from the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement (1970) gives voice to American feminists of the 1960s. These raw and immediate essays cover topics such as female orgasm, the nature of prostitution, the lives of radical lesbians, and the challenge of being Black and female. Morgan\u2019s second groundbreaking edited volume, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), compiles articles about the status of women in seventy countries. In 1984 Morgan co-founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI) with Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986), bringing together the writers of the anthology at an organizing conference. SIGI functions as a think-tank on women\u2019s human rights worldwide. Morgan is also co-founder of The Women\u2019s Media Center with Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem. A third anthology, Sisterhood is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003) was a well-received collection of articles by prominent feminists in which Morgan exhorted both young and the \u201cvintage\u201d feminists to take credit for the astounding and irreversible revolution they brought about. Morgan has since published several further works of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including Fighting Words: A Toolkit for Combating the Religious Right (2006) and a novel, Parallax, published in 2019. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection documenting aspects of Morgan\u2019s political history, personal life, and professional works, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. Morgan has received numerous awards, including the National Endowment for the Arts prize in poetry, the 1990 Feminist Majority Foundation Woman of the Year Award, and the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism. She has also been awarded grants from the Ford Foundation and received prizes for her editorial excellence. In 1992, Morgan was awarded an Honorary Degree as Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs, and in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now. Morgan was also awarded a \u201cFemmy\u201d award from the Feminist Press in 2003 for her \u201cservice to literature\u201d and in 2007 was awarded a Humanist Heroine Award by the American Humanist Association.

The conference had been convened by a group that wanted to defend two positions that have made radical feminism anathema to much of the left. First, the organizers hoped to refute charges that the desire to ban prostitution implies hostility toward prostitutes. Then they were going to try to explain why, at a time when transgender rights are ascendant, radical feminists insist on regarding transgender women as men, who should not be allowed to use women\u2019s facilities, such as public rest rooms, or to participate in events organized exclusively for women. The dispute began more than forty years ago, at the height of the second-wave feminist movement. In one early skirmish, in 1973, the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in Los Angeles, furiously split over a scheduled performance by the folksinger Beth Elliott, who is what was then called a transsexual. Robin Morgan, the keynote speaker, said: I will not call a male \u201cshe\u201d; thirty-two years of suffering in this androcentric society, and of surviving, have earned me the title \u201cwoman\u201d; one walk down the street by a male transvestite, five minutes of his being hassled (which he may enjoy), and then he dares, he dares to think he understands our pain? No, in our mothers\u2019 names and in our own, we must not call him sister. Such views are shared by few feminists now, but they still have a foothold among some self-described radical feminists, who have found themselves in an acrimonious battle with trans people and their allies. Trans women say that they are women because they feel female\u2014that, as some put it, they have women\u2019s brains in men\u2019s bodies. Radical feminists reject the notion of a \u201cfemale brain.\u201d They believe that if women think and act differently from men it\u2019s because society forces them to, requiring them to be sexually attractive, nurturing, and deferential. In the words of Lierre Keith, a speaker at Radfems Respond, femininity is \u201critualized submission.\u201d In this view, gender is less an identity than a caste position. Anyone born a man retains male privilege in society; even if he chooses to live as a woman\u2014and accept a correspondingly subordinate social position\u2014the fact that he has a choice means that he can never understand what being a woman is really like. By extension, when trans women demand to be accepted as women they are simply exercising another form of male entitlement. All this enrages trans women and their allies, who point to the discrimination that trans people endure; although radical feminism is far from achieving all its goals, women have won far more formal equality than trans people have. In most states, it\u2019s legal to fire someone for being transgender, and transgender people can\u2019t serve in the military. A recent survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force found overwhelming levels of anti-trans violence and persecution. Forty-one per cent of respondents said that they had attempted suicide. Yet, at the same time, the trans-rights movement is growing in power and cachet: a recent Time cover featuring the actress Laverne Cox was headlined \u201cTHE TRANSGENDER TIPPING POINT.\u201d The very word \u201ctransgender,\u201d which first came into wide use in the nineteen-nineties, encompasses far more people than the term \u201ctranssexual\u201d did. It includes not just the small number of people who seek gender-reassignment surgery\u2014according to frequently cited estimates, about one in thirty thousand men and one in a hundred thousand women\u2014but also those who take hormones, or who simply identify with the opposite gender, or, in some cases, with both or with neither. (According to the National Center survey, most trans women have taken female hormones, but only about a quarter of them have had genital surgery.) The elasticity of the term \u201ctransgender\u201d has forced a rethinking of what sex and gender mean; at least in progressive circles, what\u2019s determinative isn\u2019t people\u2019s chromosomes or their genitals or the way that they were brought up but how they see themselves. Having rejected this supposition, radical feminists now find themselves in a position that few would have imagined when the conflict began: shunned as reactionaries on the wrong side of a sexual-rights issue. It is, to them, a baffling political inversion. Radfems Respond was originally to have taken place across town from the library, at a Quaker meeting house, but trans activists had launched a petition on Change\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan known for?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1057}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They said that, in hosting it, the Quakers would alienate trans people and \u201cbe complicit in the violence against them.\u201d The Quakers, citing concerns in their community, revoked the agreement. It wasn\u2019t the first time that such an event had lost a scheduled venue. The Radfem 2012 conference was to be held in London, at Conway Hall, which bills itself as \u201ca hub for free speech and independent thought.\u201d But trans activists objected both to Radfem\u2019s women-only policy\u2014which was widely understood to exclude trans women\u2014and to the participation of Sheila Jeffreys, a professor of political science at the University of Melbourne. Jeffreys was scheduled to speak on prostitution, but she is a longtime critic of the transgender movement, and Conway Hall officials decided that they could not allow speakers who \u201cconflict with our ethos, principles, and culture.\u201d Ultimately, the event was held at a still secret location; organizers escorted delegates to it from a nearby meeting place. Radfem 2013 also had to switch locations, as did a gathering in Toronto last year, called Radfems Rise Up. In response, thirty-seven radical feminists, including major figures from the second wave, such as Ti-Grace Atkinson, Kathie Sarachild, and Michele Wallace, signed a statement titled \u201cForbidden Discourse: The Silencing of Feminist Criticism of \u2018Gender,\u2019 \u201d which described their \u201calarm\u201d at \u201cthreats and attacks, some of them physical, on individuals and organizations daring to challenge the currently fashionable concept of gender.\u201d With all this in mind, the Radfems Respond organizers had arranged the library space as a backup, but then a post on Portland Indymedia announced: We questioned the library administration about allowing a hate group who promotes discrimination and their response is that they cannot kick them out because of freedom of speech. So we also exercise our right to free speech in public space this Saturday to drive the TERFS and Radfems out of OUR library and OUR Portland! (TERF stands for \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminist.\u201d The term can be useful for making a distinction with radical feminists who do not share the same position, but those at whom it is directed consider it a slur.) Abusive posts proliferated on Twitter and, especially, Tumblr. One read, \u201c/kill/terfs 2K14.\u201d Another suggested, \u201chow about \u2018slowly and horrendously murder terfs in saw-like torture machines and contraptions\u2019 2K14.\u201d A young blogger holding a knife posted a selfie with the caption \u201cFetch me a terf.\u201d Such threats have become so common that radical-feminist Web sites have taken to cataloguing them. \u201cIt\u2019s aggrieved entitlement,\u201d Lierre Keith told me. \u201cThey are so angry that we will not see them as women.\u201d Keith is a writer and an activist who runs a small permaculture farm in Northern California. She is forty-nine, with cropped pewter hair and a uniform of black T-shirts and jeans. Three years ago, she co-founded the ecofeminist group Deep Green Resistance, which has some two hundred members and links the oppression of women to the pillaging of the planet. D.G.R. is defiantly militant, refusing to condemn the use of violence in the service of goals it considers just. In radical circles, though, what makes the group truly controversial is its stance on gender. As members see it, a person born with male privilege can no more shed it through surgery than a white person can claim an African-American identity simply by darkening his or her skin. Before D.G.R. held its first conference, in 2011, in Wisconsin, the group informed a person in the process of a male-to-female transition that she couldn\u2019t stay in the women\u2019s quarters. \u201cWe said, That\u2019s fine if you want to come, but, no, you\u2019re not going to have access to the women\u2019s sleeping spaces and the women\u2019s bathrooms,\u201d Keith told me. Last February, Keith was to be a keynote speaker at the Public Interest Environmental Law Conference, at the University of Oregon, in Eugene, but the student government voted to condemn her, and more than a thousand people signed a petition demanding that the address be cancelled. Amid threats of violence, six policemen escorted Keith to the lectern, though, in the end, the protest proved peaceful: some audience members walked out and held a rally, leaving her to speak to a half-empty room. Keith had an easier time at Radfems Respond, where she spoke on the differences between radicalism and liberalism.

A men\u2019s-rights activist showed up\u2014he later posted mocking clips from a video that he had secretly made\u2014but said nothing during the sessions. Several trans women arrived and sat at the back, but, in fact, they were there to express solidarity, having decided that the attacks on radical feminists were both out of control and misguided. One of them, a thin, forty-year-old blonde from the Bay Area, who blogs under the name Snowflake Especial, noted that all the violence against trans women that she\u2019s aware of was committed by men. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we dealing with them?\u201d she asked. Despite that surprising show of support, most of the speakers felt embattled. Heath Atom Russell gave the closing talk. A stocky woman, with curly turquoise hair and a bluish stubble shadow on her cheeks, she wore a T-shirt that read \u201cI Survived Testosterone Poisoning.\u201d At twenty-five, she is a \u201cdetransitioner,\u201d a person who once identified as transgender but no longer does. (Expert estimates of the number of transitioners who abandon their new gender range from fewer than one per cent to as many as five per cent.) Russell, a lesbian who grew up in a conservative Baptist family in Southern California, began transitioning to male as a student at Humboldt State University, and was embraced by gender-rights groups on campus. She started taking hormones and changed her name. Then, in her senior year, she discovered \u201cUnpacking Queer Politics\u201d (2003), by Sheila Jeffreys, which critiques female-to-male transsexualism as capitulation to misogyny. At first, the book infuriated Russell, but she couldn\u2019t let go of the questions that it raised about her own identity. She had been having heart palpitations, which made her uneasy about the hormones she was taking. Nor did she ever fully believe herself to be male. At one point during her transition, she hooked up with a middle-aged trans woman. Russell knew that she was supposed to think of herself as a man with a woman, but, she said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right, and I was scared.\u201d Eventually, she proclaimed herself a woman again, and a radical feminist, though it meant being ostracized by many of her friends. She is now engaged to a woman; someone keyed the word \u201cdyke\u201d on her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s car. Russell appears in Sheila Jeffreys\u2019s new book, \u201cGender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism.\u201d Jeffreys, who is sixty-six, has short silver hair and a weathered face. She has taught at the University of Melbourne for twenty-three years, but she grew up in London, and has been described as the Andrea Dworkin of the U.K. She has written nine previous books, all of which focus on the sexual subjugation of women, whether through rape, incest, pornography, prostitution, or Western beauty norms. Like Dworkin, she is viewed as a heroine by a cadre of like-minded admirers and as a zealot by others. In 2005, in an admiring feature in the Guardian, Julie Bindel wrote, \u201cJeffreys sees sexuality as the basis of the oppression of women by men, in much the same way as Marx saw capitalism as the scourge of the working class. This unwavering belief has made her many enemies. Postmodern theorist Judith Halberstam once said, \u2018If Sheila Jeffreys did not exist, Camille Paglia would have had to invent her.\u2019 \u201d In eight brisk chapters (half of them written with Jeffreys\u2019s former Ph.D. student Lorene Gottschalk), \u201cGender Hurts\u201d offers Jeffreys\u2019s first full-length treatment of transgenderism. Ordinarily, Jeffreys told me, she would launch the publication of a new book with an event at the university, but this time campus security warned against it. She has also taken her name off her office door. She gave a talk in London this month, but it was invitation-only. In the book, Jeffreys calls detransitioners like Russell \u201csurvivors,\u201d and cites them as evidence that transgenderism isn\u2019t immutable and thus doesn\u2019t warrant radical medical intervention. (She considers gender-reassignment surgery a form of mutilation.) \u201cThe phenomenon of regret undermines the idea that there exists a particular kind of person who is genuinely and essentially transgender and can be identified accurately by psychiatrists,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is radically destabilising to the transgender project.\u201d She cites as further evidence the case of Bradley Cooper, who, in 2011, at the age of seventeen, became Britain\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan known for?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1052}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Jeffreys is especially alarmed by doctors in Europe, Australia, and the United States who treat transgender children with puberty-delaying drugs, which prevent them from developing unwanted secondary sex characteristics and can result in sterilization. Throughout the book, Jeffreys insists on using male pronouns to refer to trans women and female ones to refer to trans men. \u201cUse by men of feminine pronouns conceals the masculine privilege bestowed upon them by virtue of having been placed in and brought up in the male sex caste,\u201d she writes. To her critics, the book becomes particularly hateful when she tries to account for the reality of trans people. Explaining female-to-male transition is fairly easy for her (and for other radical feminists): women seek to become men in order to raise their status in a sexist system. Heath Atom Russell, for example, is quoted as attributing her former desire to become a man to the absence of a \u201cproud woman loving culture.\u201d But, if that\u2019s true, why would men demote themselves to womanhood? For reasons of sexual fetishism, Jeffreys says. She substantiates her argument with the highly controversial theories of Ray Blanchard, a retired professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the related work of J. Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University. Contrary to widespread belief, Blanchard says, the majority of trans women in the West start off not as effeminate gay men but as straight or bisexual men, and they are initially motivated by erotic compulsion rather than by any conceived female identity. \u201cThe core is, it\u2019s really exciting for guys to imagine themselves with female breasts, or female breasts and a vulva,\u201d he told me. To describe the syndrome, Blanchard coined the term \u201cautogynephilia,\u201d meaning sexual arousal at the thought of oneself as female. Blanchard is far from a radical feminist. He believes that gender-reassignment surgery can relieve psychological suffering; he has even counselled people who undergo it. He also accepts the commonly held view that male brains differ from female brains in ways that affect behavior. Nevertheless, Jeffreys believes that the work of Blanchard and Bailey shows that when trans women ask to be accepted as women they\u2019re seeking to have an erotic fixation indulged. The last time a feminist of any standing published an attack on transgenderism as caustic as \u201cGender Hurts\u201d was in 1979, when Janice Raymond produced \u201cThe Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.\u201d Raymond was a lesbian ex-nun who became a doctoral student of the radical-feminist theologian Mary Daly, at Boston College. Inspired by the women\u2019s-health movement, Raymond framed much of \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d as a critique of a patriarchal medical and psychiatric establishment. Still, the book was frequently febrile, particularly with regard to lesbian trans women. \u201cAll transsexuals rape women\u2019s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves,\u201d Raymond wrote. \u201cHowever, the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist violates women\u2019s sexuality and spirit.\u201d It\u2019s a measure of how much perceptions have changed in the past thirty-five years that \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d received a respectful, even admiring hearing in the mainstream media, unlike \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d which has been largely ignored there. Reviewing \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d in the Times, the psychiatrist Thomas Szasz called it \u201cflawless.\u201d Raymond, he wrote, \u201chas rightly seized on transsexualism as an emblem of modern society\u2019s unremitting\u2014though increasingly concealed\u2014antifeminism.\u201d One of the women Raymond wrote about was Sandy Stone, a performance artist and academic who this fall will teach digital arts and new media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. When Raymond\u2019s book was published, Stone was a recording engineer at Olivia Records, a women\u2019s-music collective in Los Angeles. In the late sixties, after graduating from college, and while still living as a man, she had bluffed her way into a job at New York\u2019s famed Record Plant recording studio, where she worked with Jimi Hendrix and the Velvet Underground. (For a time, she slept in the studio basement, on a pile of Hendrix\u2019s capes.) She moved to the West Coast and transitioned in 1974. Olivia approached her soon afterward; experienced female recording engineers were hard to find. Stone became a member of the collective the next year and moved into a communal house that it rented, where she was the only trans woman among a dozen or so other lesbians.

She eventually earned a doctorate in philosophy at Santa Cruz. In 1987, Stone wrote an essay, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto,\u201d which is widely seen as the founding text of transgender studies. It\u2019s still taught around the world; a second French edition is about to be published, and Stone has received a request to allow a Catalan translation. The last time that Janice Raymond wrote on transgender issues was in 1994, for a new introduction to \u201cThe Transsexual Empire.\u201d Since then, she has focussed on sex trafficking, and last August a Norwegian government agency invited her to Oslo to speak on a panel about prostitution legislation. When she arrived, however, an official informed her that she had been disinvited; a letter to the editor of a major Norwegian newspaper had accused her of transphobia. Raymond says that similar things have \u201chappened much more frequently within the last couple of years.\u201d The most dramatic change in the perception of transgenderism can be seen in academia. Particularly at liberal-arts colleges, students are now routinely asked which gender pronoun they would prefer to be addressed by: choices might include \u201cze,\u201d \u201cou,\u201d \u201chir,\u201d \u201cthey,\u201d or even \u201cit.\u201d A decade ago, no university offered a student health plan that covered gender-reassignment surgery. Today, dozens do, including Harvard, Brown, Duke, Yale, Stanford, and the schools in the University of California system. There are young transgender-critical radical feminists, like Heath Atom Russell and Rachel Ivey, aged twenty-four, who was one of the organizers of Radfems Respond, but they are the first to admit that they\u2019re a minority. \u201cIf I were to say in a typical women\u2019s-studies class today, \u2018Female people are oppressed on the basis of reproduction,\u2019 I would get called out,\u201d Ivey says. Other students, she adds, would ask, \u201cWhat about women who are male?\u201d That might be an exaggeration, but only a slight one. The members of the board of the New York Abortion Access Fund, an all-volunteer group that helps to pay for abortions for those who can\u2019t afford them, are mostly young women; Alison Turkos, the group\u2019s co-chair, is twenty-six. In May, they voted unanimously to stop using the word \u201cwomen\u201d when talking about people who get pregnant, so as not to exclude trans men. \u201cWe recognize that people who identify as men can become pregnant and seek abortions,\u201d the group\u2019s new Statement of Values says. A Change.org petition asks NARAL and Planned Parenthood to adopt similarly gender-inclusive language. It specifically criticizes the hashtag #StandWithTexasWomen, which ricocheted around Twitter during State Senator Wendy Davis\u2019s filibuster against an anti-abortion bill in her state, and the phrase \u201cTrust Women,\u201d which was the slogan of George Tiller, the doctor and abortion provider who was murdered in Wichita in 2009. To some younger activists, it seems obvious that anyone who objects to such changes is simply clinging to the privilege inherent in being cisgender, a word popularized in the nineteen-nineties to mean any person who is not transgender. Alison Turkos has heard complaints that the new language obscures the fact that cisgender women overwhelmingly bear the brunt of the current political attacks on reproductive rights. She replies, \u201cIt may not feel comfortable, but it\u2019s important to create a space for more people who are often denied space and visibility.\u201d Older feminists who have not yet adopted this way of thinking can find themselves experiencing ideological whiplash. Sara St. Martin Lynne, a forty-year-old filmmaker and video producer from Oakland, told me, \u201cWhen you come from a liberation, leftist background, you want to be on the right side of history,\u201d and the debate \u201ckind of puts you through your paces.\u201d Last year, she was asked to resign from the board of Bay Area Girls Rock Camp, a nonprofit that \u201cempowers girls through music,\u201d because of her involvement with the Michigan Womyn\u2019s Music Festival, which bills itself as an event for \u201cwomyn-born womyn\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan known for?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1028}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Michfest, as it\u2019s called, takes place every August, on six hundred and fifty acres of land in the woods east of Lake Michigan. Lisa Vogel founded it in 1976, when she was a nineteen-year-old Central Michigan University student, and she still runs it. The music, Vogel says, is only part of what makes Michfest important. Each year, several thousand women set up camp there and find themselves, for a week, living in a matriarchy. Meals are cooked in kitchen tents and eaten communally. There are workshops and classes. Some women don extravagant costumes; others wear nothing at all. There is free child care and a team to assist disabled women who ordinarily cannot go camping. Vogel describes the governing ethos as \u201cHow would a town look if we actually got to decide what was important?\u201d She told me, \u201cThere\u2019s something that I experience on the land when I walk at night without a flashlight in the woods and recognize that for that moment I feel completely safe. And there\u2019s nowhere else I can do that.\u201d She continued, \u201cIf, tomorrow, we said everyone is welcome, I\u2019m sure it would still be a really cool event, but that piece that allows women to let down their guard and feel that really deep sense of personal liberation would be different, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about.\u201d To transgender activists, Vogel\u2019s stance is laden with offensive assumptions: that trans women are different in an essential way from other women, and that they\u2019re dangerous. \u201cThe trope of trans women\u201d constituting \u201ca threat to women\u2019s spaces has been tossed around forever,\u201d Julia Serano told me. To her, it\u2019s akin to straight people refusing to share a locker room with gays or lesbians. Serano, forty-six, is a biologist by training who now spends most of her time writing and speaking on transgender issues and feminism; last year, she lectured at schools including Brown, Stanford, Smith, and Cornell. (Sheila Jeffreys attacks her in \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d using autobiographical details from Serano\u2019s first book, \u201cWhipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity\u201d (2007), to paint her as an autogynephile who seeks to \u201creinvent \u2018feminism\u2019 to fit his erotic interests.\u201d) In the summer of 2003, Serano joined about a hundred people at Camp Trans, a protest camp near the Michfest site, which has run intermittently since 1994. Serano said that relations with Michfest attendees were often unexpectedly cordial. A few years ago, though, Vogel says, some protesters committed acts of vandalism\u2014stealing electrical cables, cutting water pipes, keying cars in the parking lot, and spray-painting a six-foot penis, and the words \u201cReal Women Have Dicks,\u201d on the side of the main kitchen tent. Since then, as with the case of Olivia Records, the demonstrations have been supplanted by a boycott campaign. Last year, the Indigo Girls, longtime regulars at Michfest, announced that they wouldn\u2019t appear again until the event became trans-inclusive. This year, the scheduled headliners, Hunter Valentine, pulled out for the same reason. Performers who do appear face protests and boycotts of their own; the funk singer Shelley Nicole says that her band, blaKb\u00fcshe, was dropped from a show in Brooklyn because it is playing at Michfest next month. Before Sara St. Martin Lynne was asked to leave the Bay Area Girls Rock Camp board, she hadn\u2019t identified closely with radical feminism. Yet, as the campaign against Michfest\u2014and against radical feminism as a whole\u2014has grown, she\u2019s come to feel strongly about keeping the event \u201cwomyn-born-womyn.\u201d She said, \u201cThis moment where we\u2019re losing the ability to say the word \u2018woman\u2019 or to acknowledge the fact that being born female has lived consequences and meaning is kind of intense to me.\u201d One of the trans women who showed up at the Radfems Respond conference, a thirty-five-year-old software engineer from California, with a tiny nose stud and long brown hair, agrees. She understands why trans women are hurt by their exclusion from Michfest and other female-only events and facilities, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not really wanting to invade space. It\u2019s a deep-seated wanting to belong.\u201d But, she adds, \u201cif you\u2019re identifying with women, shouldn\u2019t you be empathizing with women?\u201d Sandy Stone shares this view\u2014up to a point.

Although it was CBS's answer to NBC's A Date with Judy, it was also broadcast by NBC in 1948 as a summer replacement for The Bob Hope Show. From October 3, 1952, to June 26, 1953, it aired on ABC, finally returning to CBS. Despite the program's long run, fewer than 24 episodes are known to exist. Priscilla Lyon and Janet Waldo successively portrayed 15-year-old Corliss on radio. Lugene Sanders also played Corliss briefly on radio and in the CBS version of the Meet Corliss Archer television show. Perpetually perky, breathless and well-intentioned, Corliss is constantly at the side of her next-door neighbor and boyfriend, Dexter Franklin (Bill Christy, Sam Edwards). Clumsy, nerdy Dexter, a sweet but constant bungler with a nasal voice, is best remembered for his trademark phrase, \"Holy cow!\" and his braying call, \"Heyyyy, Corrrrrliiiiiss!\"\u2014frequently delivered from the hedge separating their houses. Harry Archer, Corliss's father, is a lawyer who tolerates Dexter only when he wants to use him to help flaunt male superiority. Gruff but gentle, he was played by Bob Bailey, Fred Shields and Frank Martin. Janet Archer, Corliss's mother, was played by, successively, Irene Tedrow, Monty Margetts and Gloria Holden. She is calm and understanding with her daughter and her husband, both of whom sometimes try her patience. Other frequent characters include Mildred Ames, a good friend of Corliss (played by Bebe Young and Barbara Whiting); Mildred's irritating younger brother Raymond (Tommy Bernard, Kenny Godkin); and Corliss's rival, Betty Cameron (Delores Crane). Meet Corliss Archer was written by F. Hugh Herbert, who first introduced the character and her friends in a Good Housekeeping magazine story \"A Private Affair,\" the first of a series of stories. Kiss and Tell was a 1943 play that was adapted for a 1945 film starring Shirley Temple. The 1949 sequel, A Kiss for Corliss, was re-released in 1954. Herbert's Meet Corliss Archer property was adapted to television in 1951 and 1952 with live broadcasts produced and aired by CBS. In 1954 and 1955 Ziv Television Programs produced a syndicated telefilm series starring Ann Baker and Mary Brian. One of the show's unique features was the occasional cut to a comic-book-style drawing, with announcer's commentary, that illustrated the current story situation and was used several times during each episode. The program was produced by Ziv Productions. Several episodes of the Ziv version are available on DVD, and some are also available from the Internet Archive. Robin Morgan portrayed Corliss in a live telecast of Kiss and Tell on The Alcoa Hour (August 5, 1956), with Warren Berlinger as Dexter. Radio listeners had to use their imaginations to visualize Corliss, her friends and her town. But those imaginations got a boost in 1948 when the Meet Corliss Archer comic book, published by Fox Feature Syndicate, came out in three issues from March to July 1948. Al Feldstein (Albert B. Feldstein), later the editor of Mad, was a key writer and illustrator of this short-lived comic book series, which is now remembered primarily for his artwork in general and the good girl art covers in particular. Film strips and radio microphones on the front cover indicated the tie-ins and media crossovers. Janet Waldo was depicted on the front cover twice, as herself and as Corliss.\n\nquestion: What is Shirley Temple known for in the feminist movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 901}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since the early 1960s, she has been a key radical feminist member of the American Women's Movement, and a leader in the international feminist movement. Her 1970 anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful was cited by the New York Public Library as \"One of the 100 Most Influential Books of the 20th Century.\". She has written more than 20 books of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, and was editor of Ms. magazine. During the 1960s, she participated in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements; in the late 1960s, she was a founding member of radical feminist organizations such as New York Radical Women and W.I.T.C.H. She founded or co-founded the Feminist Women's Health Network, the National Battered Women's Refuge Network, Media Women, the National Network of Rape Crisis Centers, the Feminist Writers' Guild, the Women's Foreign Policy Council, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, GlobalSister.org, and Greenstone Women's Radio Network. She also co-founded the Women's Media Center with activist Gloria Steinem and actor/activist Jane Fonda. In 2018, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women. Due to circumstances at her birth, her mother claimed that Robin Morgan was born a year later than she actually was (see birth and parents), and throughout her career as a child actor, she was thought to be a year younger than she actually was, both by herself and others. Already as a toddler, her mother, Faith, and mother's sister Sally started Robin as a child model. At the age of five, believed to be four, she got her own program, titled Little Robin Morgan, on the New York radio station WOR. She was also a regular on the original network radio version of Juvenile Jury. Her acting career took off when she was eight and started in the TV series Mama, as Dagmar Hansen, the younger sister in the family depicted in the series. The show premiered on CBS in 1949, starring Peggy Wood, and was a great success. Morgan played Cecchina Cabrini in Citizen Saint (1947). During the Golden Age of Television, Morgan starred in such \"TV spectaculars\" as Kiss and Tell and Alice in Wonderland, and guest starred on such live dramas as Omnibus, Suspense, Danger, Hallmark Hall of Fame, Robert Montgomery Presents, Tales of Tomorrow, and Kraft Theatre. She worked with directors such as Sidney Lumet, John Frankenheimer, Ralph Nelson; writers such as Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling; and performed with actors such as Boris Karloff, Rosalind Russell, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, and Cliff Robertson. Having wanted to write rather than to act since she was four, Morgan fought her mother's efforts to keep her in show business, and left the cast of Mama at age 14. As she entered adulthood, Robin Morgan continued her education as a non-matriculating student at Columbia University. She began working as a secretary at Curtis Brown Literary Agency, where she met and worked with such writers as poet W. H. Auden in the early 1960s. She had already begun publishing her own poetry (later collected in her first book of poems, Monster, published in 1972). Throughout the next decades, along with political activism, writing fiction and nonfiction prose, and lecturing at colleges and universities on women's rights, Morgan continued to write and publish poetry. In 1962, Morgan married poet Kenneth Pitchford. She gave birth to their son, Blake Morgan, in 1969. The couple divorced in 1983. At that time, she was working as an editor at Grove Press and was involved in an attempt to unionize the publishing industry. When Grove summarily fired her and other union sympathizers, she led a seizure and occupation of their offices in the spring of 1970, protesting the union-busting, as well as the dishonest accounting of royalties to Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow. Morgan and eight other women were arrested that day. In the mid-1970s Morgan became a Contributing Editor to Ms. magazine, and continued her affiliation there as a part- or full-time editor in the following decades. She served as editor-in-chief of the magazine from 1989 to 1994, turning it into a highly successful, ad-free, bimonthly, international publication, which won awards for both writing and design, and received considerable acclaim among journalists. In 1979, when the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed, featuring famous women from politics, media and entertainment, culture, sports, and other areas of achievement, one of the cards featured Morgan's name and picture. Today, the trading cards are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the University of Iowa library. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit\n\nquestion: What is Shirley Temple known for in the feminist movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1140}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Seven years later, in 2012, she debuted a weekly radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live With Robin Morgan. The broadcast is syndicated in the US and, as a podcast, is published online at the WMCLive website, and distributed on iTunes in 110 countries. It has been praised by The Huffington Post as \"talk radio with a brain\" and features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. The weekly hour was picked up by CBS Radio two weeks after its launch and is broadcast on CBS affiliate WJFK each Saturday. The program features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. By 1962 Morgan had become active in the anti-war Left, and had also contributed articles and poetry to such Left-wing and counter-culture journals as Liberation, Rat, Win, and The National Guardian. In the 1960s she became increasingly involved in social-justice movements, notably the civil-rights and anti-Vietnam war. In early 1967, she was active in the Youth International Party (known in the media as the \"Yippies\"), with Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner. However, tensions over sexism within the YIP (and the New Left in general) came to a head when Morgan grew more involved in Women's Liberation and contemporary feminism. In 1967, Morgan became a founding member of the short-lived New York Radical Women group. She was the key organizer of their September 1968 inaugural protest of the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City. Morgan wrote the Miss America protest pamphlet No More Miss America!, and that same year cofounded Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.), a radical feminist group that used public street theater (called \"hexes\" or \"zaps\") to call attention to sexism. Morgan designed the universal symbol of the women\u2019s movement\u2013\u2013the female symbol, a circle with a cross beneath, centered with a raised fist. The Oxford English Dictionary also credits her with first using the term \"herstory\" in print in her 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful. Concerning the feminist organization W.I.T.C.H., Morgan wrote: With the royalties from her anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful, Morgan founded the first feminist grant-giving foundation in the US: The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, which provided seed money to many early women's groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s. She made a decisive break from what she described as the \"male Left\" when she led the women's takeover of the underground newspaper Rat in 1970, and listed the reasons for her break in the first women's issue of the paper, in her essay titled \"Goodbye to All That\". The essay gained notoriety in the press for naming specific sexist men and institutions in the Left. Decades later, during the Democratic primaries for the 2008 presidential race, Morgan wrote a fiery sequel to her original essay, titled \"Goodbye To All That #2\", in defense of Hillary Clinton. The article quickly went viral on the internet for lambasting sexist rhetoric directed towards Clinton by the media. In 1977, Morgan became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Morgan has traveled extensively across the United States and around the world to bring attention to cross-cultural sexism. She has met with and interviewed female rebel fighters in the Philippines, Brazilian women activists in the slums/favelas of Rio, women organizers in the townships of South Africa, and underground feminists in Iran. Twice\u2013\u2013in 1986 and 1989 she spent months in the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, West Bank, and Gaza, to report on the conditions of women. Morgan has also spoken at universities and institutions in countries across Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America, as well as in Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. Over the years, Morgan has received numerous awards for her activism on women\u2019s rights. The Feminist Majority Foundation named Robin Morgan \"Woman of the Year\" in 1990; she received the Warrior Woman Award for Promoting Racial Understanding from The Asian American Women's National Organization in 1992; in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now, and in 2003 The Feminist Press gave her a \"Femmy\" Award for her \"service to literature\". She has also received the Humanist Heroine Award from The American Humanist Association in 2007. In March 2012 Morgan, along with her Women's Media Center co-founders Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem, wrote an open letter asking listeners to request\n\nquestion: What is Shirley Temple known for in the feminist movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1139}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They asked that stations licensed for public airwaves carrying Limbaugh be held accountable for contravening public interest as a continual promoter of hate speech against various disempowered and minority groups. In 1970, Morgan compiled, edited, and introduced the first anthology of feminist writings, Sisterhood is Powerful. The compilation included now-classic feminist essays by such activists as Naomi Weisstein, Kate Millett, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Florynce Kennedy, Frances M. Beal, Joreen, Marge Piercy, Lucinda Cisler and Mary Daly, as well as historical documents including the N.O.W. Bill of Rights, excerpts from the SCUM Manifesto, the Redstockings Manifesto, historical documents from W.I.T.C.H., and a germinal statement from the Black Women\u2019s Liberation Group of Mount Vernon. It also included what Morgan called \"verbal karate\": useful quotes and statistics about women. The anthology was cited by the New York Public Library as one of the \u201cNew York Public Library's Books of the  Century\u201d. Morgan established the first American feminist grant-giving organization, The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, with the royalties from Sisterhood Is Powerful. However, the anthology was banned in Chile, China, and South Africa. Her follow-up volume in 1984, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology, compiled articles about women in over seventy countries. That same year she founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, notable for being the first international feminist think tank. Repeatedly refusing the post of president, she was elected secretary of the organization from 1989 to 1993, was VP from 1993 to 1997, and after serving on the advisory board, finally agreed to become president in 2004. A third volume, Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium in 2003, was a collection of articles mostly by well-known feminists, both young and \"vintage\", in a retrospective on and future blueprint for the feminist movement. It was compiled, edited, and with an introduction by Morgan, and Morgan wrote \"To Vintage Feminists\" and \"To Younger Women\", which were both included in the anthology as Personal Postscripts. Morgan's articles, essays, reviews, interviews, political analyses, and investigative journalism have appeared widely in such publications as The Atlantic, Broadsheet, Chrysalis, Essence, Everywoman, The Feminist Art Journal, The Guardian (US), The Guardian (UK), The Hudson Review, the Los Angeles Times, Ms., The New Republic, The New York Times, Off Our Backs, Pacific Ways, The Second Wave, Sojourner, The Village Voice, The Voice of Women, and various United Nations periodicals, etc. Articles and essays have also appeared in reprint in international media, in English across the Commonwealth, and in translation in 13 languages in Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. Morgan has served as a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for many years, receiving the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism for her cover story titled \"The First Feminist Exiles from the USSR\" in 1981. She served as the magazine's editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, re-launching it as an ad-free, international bimonthly publication in 1991. This earned her a series of awards, including the award for Editorial Excellence by Utne Reader in 1991, and the Exceptional Merit in Journalism Award by the National Women's Political Caucus. Morgan resigned her post in 1994 to become Consulting Global Editor of the magazine, which she remains to this day. Morgan has written for online audiences and blogged frequently. Among her best known articles are \"Letters from Ground Zero\" (written and posted after the September 11 attacks in 2001 \u2014 which went viral), \"Goodbye To All That #2\", \"Women of the Arab Spring\", \"When Bad News is Good News: Notes of a Feminist News Junkie\", \"Manhood and Moral Waivers\", and \"Faith Healing: A Modest Proposal on Religious Fundamentalism\". Her online work is hosted in the archives of the Women's Media Center. Robin Morgan has published 21 books, including works of poetry, fiction, and the now-classic anthologies Sisterhood Is Powerful, Sisterhood Is Global, and Sisterhood Is Forever. Well before she was known as a feminist leader, literary magazines published her as a serious poet. According to a 1972 review of her first book of poems, Monster, in The Washington Post: \" establish Morgan as a poet of considerable means. There is a savage elegance, a richness of vocabulary, a thrust and steely polish..... A powerful, challenging book.\" In 1979 Morgan received a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in poetry,\n\nquestion: What is Shirley Temple known for in the feminist movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1141}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Norton, 1990), Death Benefits (Copper Canyon Press, 1981), Lady of the Beasts (Random House, 1976), and Monster (Random House, 1972). Of the book A Hot January, Alice Walker wrote: \"Morgan proves that exquisite poetry can be the most surprising gift of grief. A volume as proud, fierce, vulnerable, and brave as the poet herself.\" A review of Upstairs in the Garden, noted: \"As a vindication and celebration of the female experience, these inventive poems successfully wed feminist rhetoric with vivid imagery and sensitivity to the music of language.\" Two books of poems, Lady of the Beasts and Depth Perception, earned reviews in Poetry Magazine with critic Jay Parini stating that \"Robin Morgan will soon be regarded as one of our first-ranking poets.\" Morgan had published three books of fiction as of 2015. Her debut novel was the semi-autobiographical Dry Your Smile (published by Doubleday & Company, 1987), followed by The Mer-Child: A Legend for Children and Other Adults (published by The Feminist Press at City University of New York, 1991). Her most recent work of fiction is a historical novel titled The Burning Time (Melville House Books, 2006), set in the 14th century, based on court records of the first witchcraft trial in Ireland. The Burning Time was placed on the Recommended Quality Fiction List of 2007 by the American Library Association, in addition to being the 2006 Paperback Pick by Book Sense (The American Booksellers Association). Morgan has compiled, edited, and introduced several influential anthologies: Sisterhood Is Powerful: The Women\u2019s Liberation Anthology (1970), Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), and Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003). She has herself written non-fiction, including Going Too Far (1978), The Anatomy of Freedom (1984), The Demon Lover: On the Sexuality of Terrorism (1989), The Word of a Woman (1994), and Saturday\u2019s Child: A Memoir (2001). One of the most widely translated of Morgan\u2019s books and a best-seller, The Demon Lover is a commentary on the psychological and political roots of terrorism, and New York Times Book Review called it \"Important...compelling.... is intense and at times magnificent.\" Her most recently published book of non-fiction is Fighting Words: A Tool Kit for Combating the Religious Right (2006). In 1984, Morgan, together with the late Simone de Beauvoir of France, and women from 80 other countries, founded The Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI), an international non-profit NGO with consultative status to the United Nations, which has for three decades functioned as the world\u2019s first feminist think-tank. The Institute has played a leading policy-formulation, strategic, and activist role in the evolution of the international Women\u2019s Movement. SIGI has also developed a global communications network through which an umbrella of NGO interest, advice, contacts, and support is collectively mobilized to empower the global women\u2019s movement. Among its many activities, the Institute pioneered the first Urgent Acton Alerts regarding women\u2019s rights; the first Global Campaign To Make Visible Women\u2019s Unpaid Labor In National Accounts; and the first Women\u2019s Rights Manuals For Muslim Societies (in 12 languages). Its most recent project is Donor Direct Action (donordirectaction.org), which links front-line women\u2019s rights activists around the world to money, visibility, and popular support: minimum bureaucracy, maximum impact. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit progressive organization, The Women\u2019s Media Center with her friends actor/activist Jane Fonda, and activist Gloria Steinem. The focus of the organization is to make women powerful and visible in the media. An invited speaker at numerous universities in North America, Morgan has traveled\u2014as organizer, speaker, journalist\u2014across North America, Europe, and the Middle East to Australia, Brazil, the Caribbean, Central America, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. She has also been a guest professor or scholar in residence at a variety of academic institutions. She was guest chair for feminist studies at the New College of Florida in 1971; a visiting professor at The Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture at Rutgers University in 1987; a distinguished visiting scholar in residence for literary and cultural studies at the University of Canterbury, Christ\n\nquestion: What is Shirley Temple known for in the feminist movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1124}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She was awarded an honorary degree as a Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs in 1992. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection that documents the personal, political, and professional aspects of Morgan's life, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. They date from the 1940s to the present. Robin Morgan has been arrested, and has received death threats from both the Right and the Left because of her activism. According to a New Yorker magazine article published in the aftermath of Morgan's essay \"Goodbye to All That\" (#2) going viral on the Internet, \"At five feet tall Morgan is, not for the first time, the little woman who has started a big war.\" In her original essay, \"Goodbye to All That\" (1970), Morgan bade adieu to \"the dream that being in the leadership collective will get you anything but gonorrhea,\" referring to the \"male Left\". She also asserted that Charles Manson was \"only the logical extreme of the normal American male\u2019s fantasy.\" Two years later, Morgan published the poem \"Arraignment\", in which she openly accused Ted Hughes of the battery and murder of Sylvia Plath. There were lawsuits, Morgan's 1972 book Monster which contained that poem was banned, and underground, pirated feminist editions of it were published. As the leading organizer of the 1968 protest of the Miss America Pageant, \"No More Miss America!\", Morgan attacked the pageant\u2019s \"ludicrous 'beauty' standards and also accused the pageant of being racist, since at that time no African American woman had been a contestant. In addition\u2013\u2013according to Morgan\u2013\u2013in sending pageant winners to entertain troops in Vietnam, the women served as \"death mascots\" in an immoral war. Morgan asked, \"Where else could one find such a perfect combination of American values -- racism, militarism, capitalism -- all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol, a woman.\" Another controversial quote is from her 1978 book, Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist, where she stated: \"I feel that \"man-hating\" is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.\" Morgan famously walked off The Tonight Show in 1969 when it screened vintage footage of her as a child actor while she was trying to speak seriously about the first national march against rape. Of the incident, she has been quoted as saying: \"Imagine talking about such a subject and having it trivialized like that.\" In 1974, with her phrase \"Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice\" (from her essay \"Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape\"), she became a central figure on one of the divisive issues in feminism, particularly among anti-pornography feminists in Anglophone countries. In 1973, Robin Morgan gave the keynote speech at the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in which she criticized Beth Elliott, a performer and organizer of the conference, for being a transgender woman. In this speech she referred to Elliott as a \"transsexual male\" and used male pronouns throughout, charging her with being \"an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer-with the mentality of a rapist.\" At the end of her speech she called for a vote on ejecting Elliott, with over two-thirds voting to allow her to remain, however the minority threatened to disrupt the conference and Elliott chose to leave after her performance to avoid this. The event demonstrated the high tension surrounding transgender women's involvement in the women's movement of the 1970s. Robin Morgan grew up in New York, first in Mount Vernon, and later in Manhattan, on Sutton Place. She graduated from The Wetter School in Mount Vernon, in 1956, and was privately tutored from then until 1959. She published her first serious poetry in literary magazines at age 17. In an article published in the Jewish Women's Archive, Morgan reveals she is of Jewish ancestry, but identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She is quoted as saying, \"When compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Ashkenazic (with a touch of Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\" Morgan continues to tackle topics such as religion, politics and sex in fiery commentaries on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan.

In 2000 Norton published Morgan\u2019s memoir, Saturday's Child, in which she wrote candidly about \"the shadowy circumstances of her birth; a lifelong, impassioned, love-hate relationship with her mother; her years as a famous child actor and her fight to escape show business to become a serious writer; her marriage to a fiery bisexual poet and how motherhood transformed her life; her years in the civil rights movement, the New Left, and counterculture; her emergence a leader of global feminism; and her love affairs with women as well as men,\" according to BookNews.com. In her book, \"her passion for writing, especially poetry, is vividly conveyed, as is her love and respect for her son, born in 1969,\" according to The New York Times Book Review. In April 2013, Morgan announced publicly that she had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, discussing the diagnosis on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan, revealing that she had been diagnosed in 2010, but that her quality of life was thus far \"normal\". Since her diagnosis, Morgan has become active with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation (PDF), completing training to become part of the organization's Parkinson's Advocates in Research initiative. In 2014 she was the catalyst and took a leadership role in PDF's new Women and PD initiative, which will seek to better serve women impacted by Parkinson's disease by understanding and resolving gender inequalities in PD research, treatment, and caregiver support. Morgan has also written new poetry inspired by her battle with the disease, and performed a reading of some of the poems as a TED Talk, at the TEDWomen 2015 conference. Her mother, Faith Berkeley Morgan, traveled from her New York residence to Florida to give birth, in order to avoid public scrutiny for her unmarried status. Robin's father, a medical doctor named Mates Morgenstern, did not accompany pregnant Faith on her trip. Until Morgan was 13 years old, her mother Faith claimed that Robin's father had been killed in World War II. However, Robin overheard conversations between her mother and aunt suggesting her father was alive. When she confronted her mother, Faith changed her story to assert that Robin's father had escaped from one Nazi concentration camp after another, and that she had saved his life by sponsoring his immigration to the United States where he had no family. Not until several years later did Robin get proof that this was also a lie. Morgan learned the truth, both about her father, who was still alive, and how old she really was, early in 1961. Now a young woman, no longer working in show business, Robin found a listing for the medical practice of an obstetrician, Dr. Mates Morgenstern, in the New Brunswick, New Jersey telephone directory. Suspecting this might be her father, she had sought a meeting with him, without her mother's knowledge, and ultimately paid a surprise visit to his New Jersey office in January 1961. Morgenstern revealed that he was aware of Robin's fame as a child actor, but had remained firm in his decision to avoid contact with Faith Morgan, having chosen not to see her again after the only time he visited her and the infant Robin. He also told Robin, during their conversation in his medical office, that she in fact was born on January 29, 1941, exactly one year earlier than she thought, and disclosed the copy of her original birth certificate, that he had stored in his office. In order to conceal the out-of-wedlock birth, Faith Morgan had asked her Florida obstetrician to sign an affidavit stating that the birth took place on January 29, 1942. During the conversation in his office, Morgenstern told his daughter that he first met her mother after his arrival in the United States, more than a year before the United States entered World War II, and that she had had nothing to do with his immigration. He added that he had known Faith only briefly and claimed that she had fantasized their relationship as more important than it was. By the time Morgan met her father he had married and had two sons with a woman he had known since they were both children in Austria. Having been separated by the war, they resumed their relationship after she arrived in the United States not long after Robin was born, which probably also added to Morgenstern's decision to abandon Faith and their daughter. Morgan only met her father once more, in February 1965 when he invited her and her husband to his New Jersey home. Morgenstern did not want his sons to know that they had a half-sister and Morgan acceded to his request that they tell his two sons that she was \"the daughter of an old friend.\" She refused to do so again, however, and never met him or her two half-brothers again. Morgan describes the two encounters that she had with her biological father in her autobiography, Saturday's Child: A Memoir.

Hugh Herbert. Kiss and Tell starred Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer and Judith Parrish as her friend Mildred Pringle. The play's great success led to offers from Hollywood for Caulfield, who left the production almost one year to the day from when it opened, and was replaced in her role by her sister Betty Caulfield. Kiss and Tell premiered at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston on March 1, 1943 for tryout performances before its Broadway run. It opened in New York City on March 17, 1943 at the Biltmore Theatre. It remained there until the end of 1944, before transferring to the Bijou Theatre in 1945. It ran for a total of 956 performances before closing on June 23, 1945. The original production was produced by George Abbott and written by F. Hugh Herbert. The cast included Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer, Jessie Royce Landis as Janet Archer, Frances Bavier as Louise, Walter Davis as Uncle George, John Harvey as Private Earhart, Lulu Mae Hubbard as Dorothy Pringle, Robert Keith as Harry Archer, James Lane as Mr. Willard, Tommy Lewis as Raymond Pringle, Robert Lynn as Robert Pringle, Judith Parrish as Mildred Pringle, Calvin Thomas as Bill Franklin, Paula Trueman as Mary Franklin, Robert White as Dexter Franklin, and Richard Widmark as Lieut. Lenny Archer. Two teenage girls become interested in boys, and the girls' parents are making more problems rather than solving them. A film version written by Herbert and based on his play was released by Columbia Pictures on October 4, 1945 with Shirley Temple in the role of Corliss Archer. The film was directed by Richard Wallace and produced by Sol C. Siegel. Temple would reprise the role in the film's sequel A Kiss for Corliss in 1949.\n\nquestion: What is Shirley Temple known for in the feminist movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 494}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In 1962 she became active in the civil rights and feminist movements, quickly becoming a leader. She worked as a contributing editor for Ms. Magazine for twenty years, serving as editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994. Her editing of the Sisterhood anthologies (beginning with Sisterhood Is Powerful in 1970) has a significant impact on the feminist movement. In 1984 Morgan founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, a think tank for women\u2019s rights worldwide. Morgan continues to write and lecture around the world in addition to hosting a weekly radio and online podcast and webcast program entitled \u201cWomen\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan.\u201d \u201cIf I had to name a single quality characteristic of patriarchy, it would be compartmentalization, the capacity for institutionalizing disconnection. Intellect severed from emotion. Thought separated from action. Science split from art. The earth itself divided\u2014national borders.... The personal isolated from the political. Sex divorced from love\u2026Law detached from justice\u2026If I had to name a single quality characteristic of global feminism, it would be connectivity\u2014a capacity dangerous to every status quo, because of its insistence on noticing.\u201d In her lifetime battle for women\u2019s dignity and global change, Robin Morgan uses words as ammunition, as one can see in the above quotation from The Word of a Woman (1992). As poet, novelist, journalist, lecturer, and feminist theorist, she expresses the reality of contemporary women\u2019s oppression. Morgan was born on January 29, 1941, daughter of Faith Berkeley Morgan, in Lake Worth, Florida. As a child, Morgan\u2019s mother told her that her father had been killed in World War II and later told her other false stories about his identity and fate. Morgan learned the true identity of her father, an obstetrician/gynecologist named Mates Morgenstern, in 1961 when she was nineteen years old. They met only once in person in 1965. When Morgan was not yet a year old, her mother entered her in baby contests and she began a career first as a child model, and later as a child actor and radio personality. She remained a public figure, starring in primetime dramas and specials as well as working on the stage, until the age of fourteen, when she left the limelight to do what she really wanted: to write. Though she never formally enrolled in college, Morgan attended (nonmatriculated) classes and lectures at Columbia University and remained in New York City. At the age of seventeen, she published her first serious poetry in a literary magazine. In 1962, Morgan married writer Kenneth Pitchford, whom she divorced in 1990. Together they had one son, Blake Morgan-Pitchford, born in 1969. Morgan identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She writes: \u201cWhen compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Jews of European origin and their descendants, including most of North and South American Jewry.Ashkenazic (with a touch of Descendants of the Jews who lived in Spain and Portugal before the explusion of 1492; primarily Jews of N. Africa, Italy, the Middle East and the Balkans.Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. And I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\u201d Morgan became an activist during the 1960s and was involved in the civil rights movement, SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee), and the anti-Vietnam War movement. She was also a founding member of New York Radical Women and other radical feminist organizations, such as W.I.T.C.H, which she co-founded in 1968. She was one of the key organizers of the 1968 protest at Atlantic City\u2019s Miss America Contest, which helped launch the second wave of United States feminism. She later reflected on the Miss America pageant, its practices, and the 1968 protest: \u201cwhere else could one find such a perfect combination of American values\u2014racism, militarism, capitalism\u2014all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol: a woman\u201d (Word of a Woman: Feminist Dispatches, 1968-1992). In the following decades, Morgan spearheaded the international women\u2019s liberation movement through her continued activism, her steadfast publishing of feminist poetry and prose, her work as a feminist journalist and editor, and her passionate international lecturing.

Morgan also funded The Sisterhood is Powerful Fund, the first feminist foundation in the United States, with royalties from Sisterhood is Powerful. In 1970, Morgan helped lead the women\u2019s takeover of Rat, a leftist newspaper. Women staffers at the paper and previous contributors like Morgan seized the paper for an issue and never gave it back. In the first women\u2019s issue of the paper, titled \u201cWomen Seize RAT! Sabotage Tales!,\u201d Morgan published what became the famous essay, \u201cGoodbye to All That,\u201d in which she addressed sexism on the Left and \u201cLeftist men\u2019s betrayal of women.\u201d Throughout her career, Morgan has traveled far and wide to interview women rebel fighters in the Philippines, Palestinian women activists in the Intifada, and women in postrevolutionary Iran. She was a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for twenty years, serving as its editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, when it was relaunched as an advertisement-free publication. Since August 2012, Morgan has hosted a nationally syndicated weekly American radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan, in which she discusses current events, interviews guests, produces in-depth investigative reports, and offers commentary on a host of contemporary issues. Morgan has written more than twenty books, including five books of poetry, two novels, and numerous books of essays. She is best known as editor of several important anthologies. Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings from the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement (1970) gives voice to American feminists of the 1960s. These raw and immediate essays cover topics such as female orgasm, the nature of prostitution, the lives of radical lesbians, and the challenge of being Black and female. Morgan\u2019s second groundbreaking edited volume, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), compiles articles about the status of women in seventy countries. In 1984 Morgan co-founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI) with Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986), bringing together the writers of the anthology at an organizing conference. SIGI functions as a think-tank on women\u2019s human rights worldwide. Morgan is also co-founder of The Women\u2019s Media Center with Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem. A third anthology, Sisterhood is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003) was a well-received collection of articles by prominent feminists in which Morgan exhorted both young and the \u201cvintage\u201d feminists to take credit for the astounding and irreversible revolution they brought about. Morgan has since published several further works of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including Fighting Words: A Toolkit for Combating the Religious Right (2006) and a novel, Parallax, published in 2019. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection documenting aspects of Morgan\u2019s political history, personal life, and professional works, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. Morgan has received numerous awards, including the National Endowment for the Arts prize in poetry, the 1990 Feminist Majority Foundation Woman of the Year Award, and the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism. She has also been awarded grants from the Ford Foundation and received prizes for her editorial excellence. In 1992, Morgan was awarded an Honorary Degree as Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs, and in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now. Morgan was also awarded a \u201cFemmy\u201d award from the Feminist Press in 2003 for her \u201cservice to literature\u201d and in 2007 was awarded a Humanist Heroine Award by the American Humanist Association.

The conference had been convened by a group that wanted to defend two positions that have made radical feminism anathema to much of the left. First, the organizers hoped to refute charges that the desire to ban prostitution implies hostility toward prostitutes. Then they were going to try to explain why, at a time when transgender rights are ascendant, radical feminists insist on regarding transgender women as men, who should not be allowed to use women\u2019s facilities, such as public rest rooms, or to participate in events organized exclusively for women. The dispute began more than forty years ago, at the height of the second-wave feminist movement. In one early skirmish, in 1973, the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in Los Angeles, furiously split over a scheduled performance by the folksinger Beth Elliott, who is what was then called a transsexual. Robin Morgan, the keynote speaker, said: I will not call a male \u201cshe\u201d; thirty-two years of suffering in this androcentric society, and of surviving, have earned me the title \u201cwoman\u201d; one walk down the street by a male transvestite, five minutes of his being hassled (which he may enjoy), and then he dares, he dares to think he understands our pain? No, in our mothers\u2019 names and in our own, we must not call him sister. Such views are shared by few feminists now, but they still have a foothold among some self-described radical feminists, who have found themselves in an acrimonious battle with trans people and their allies. Trans women say that they are women because they feel female\u2014that, as some put it, they have women\u2019s brains in men\u2019s bodies. Radical feminists reject the notion of a \u201cfemale brain.\u201d They believe that if women think and act differently from men it\u2019s because society forces them to, requiring them to be sexually attractive, nurturing, and deferential. In the words of Lierre Keith, a speaker at Radfems Respond, femininity is \u201critualized submission.\u201d In this view, gender is less an identity than a caste position. Anyone born a man retains male privilege in society; even if he chooses to live as a woman\u2014and accept a correspondingly subordinate social position\u2014the fact that he has a choice means that he can never understand what being a woman is really like. By extension, when trans women demand to be accepted as women they are simply exercising another form of male entitlement. All this enrages trans women and their allies, who point to the discrimination that trans people endure; although radical feminism is far from achieving all its goals, women have won far more formal equality than trans people have. In most states, it\u2019s legal to fire someone for being transgender, and transgender people can\u2019t serve in the military. A recent survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force found overwhelming levels of anti-trans violence and persecution. Forty-one per cent of respondents said that they had attempted suicide. Yet, at the same time, the trans-rights movement is growing in power and cachet: a recent Time cover featuring the actress Laverne Cox was headlined \u201cTHE TRANSGENDER TIPPING POINT.\u201d The very word \u201ctransgender,\u201d which first came into wide use in the nineteen-nineties, encompasses far more people than the term \u201ctranssexual\u201d did. It includes not just the small number of people who seek gender-reassignment surgery\u2014according to frequently cited estimates, about one in thirty thousand men and one in a hundred thousand women\u2014but also those who take hormones, or who simply identify with the opposite gender, or, in some cases, with both or with neither. (According to the National Center survey, most trans women have taken female hormones, but only about a quarter of them have had genital surgery.) The elasticity of the term \u201ctransgender\u201d has forced a rethinking of what sex and gender mean; at least in progressive circles, what\u2019s determinative isn\u2019t people\u2019s chromosomes or their genitals or the way that they were brought up but how they see themselves. Having rejected this supposition, radical feminists now find themselves in a position that few would have imagined when the conflict began: shunned as reactionaries on the wrong side of a sexual-rights issue. It is, to them, a baffling political inversion.

They said that, in hosting it, the Quakers would alienate trans people and \u201cbe complicit in the violence against them.\u201d The Quakers, citing concerns in their community, revoked the agreement. It wasn\u2019t the first time that such an event had lost a scheduled venue. The Radfem 2012 conference was to be held in London, at Conway Hall, which bills itself as \u201ca hub for free speech and independent thought.\u201d But trans activists objected both to Radfem\u2019s women-only policy\u2014which was widely understood to exclude trans women\u2014and to the participation of Sheila Jeffreys, a professor of political science at the University of Melbourne. Jeffreys was scheduled to speak on prostitution, but she is a longtime critic of the transgender movement, and Conway Hall officials decided that they could not allow speakers who \u201cconflict with our ethos, principles, and culture.\u201d Ultimately, the event was held at a still secret location; organizers escorted delegates to it from a nearby meeting place. Radfem 2013 also had to switch locations, as did a gathering in Toronto last year, called Radfems Rise Up. In response, thirty-seven radical feminists, including major figures from the second wave, such as Ti-Grace Atkinson, Kathie Sarachild, and Michele Wallace, signed a statement titled \u201cForbidden Discourse: The Silencing of Feminist Criticism of \u2018Gender,\u2019 \u201d which described their \u201calarm\u201d at \u201cthreats and attacks, some of them physical, on individuals and organizations daring to challenge the currently fashionable concept of gender.\u201d With all this in mind, the Radfems Respond organizers had arranged the library space as a backup, but then a post on Portland Indymedia announced: We questioned the library administration about allowing a hate group who promotes discrimination and their response is that they cannot kick them out because of freedom of speech. So we also exercise our right to free speech in public space this Saturday to drive the TERFS and Radfems out of OUR library and OUR Portland! (TERF stands for \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminist.\u201d The term can be useful for making a distinction with radical feminists who do not share the same position, but those at whom it is directed consider it a slur.) Abusive posts proliferated on Twitter and, especially, Tumblr. One read, \u201c/kill/terfs 2K14.\u201d Another suggested, \u201chow about \u2018slowly and horrendously murder terfs in saw-like torture machines and contraptions\u2019 2K14.\u201d A young blogger holding a knife posted a selfie with the caption \u201cFetch me a terf.\u201d Such threats have become so common that radical-feminist Web sites have taken to cataloguing them. \u201cIt\u2019s aggrieved entitlement,\u201d Lierre Keith told me. \u201cThey are so angry that we will not see them as women.\u201d Keith is a writer and an activist who runs a small permaculture farm in Northern California. She is forty-nine, with cropped pewter hair and a uniform of black T-shirts and jeans. Three years ago, she co-founded the ecofeminist group Deep Green Resistance, which has some two hundred members and links the oppression of women to the pillaging of the planet. D.G.R. is defiantly militant, refusing to condemn the use of violence in the service of goals it considers just. In radical circles, though, what makes the group truly controversial is its stance on gender. As members see it, a person born with male privilege can no more shed it through surgery than a white person can claim an African-American identity simply by darkening his or her skin. Before D.G.R. held its first conference, in 2011, in Wisconsin, the group informed a person in the process of a male-to-female transition that she couldn\u2019t stay in the women\u2019s quarters. \u201cWe said, That\u2019s fine if you want to come, but, no, you\u2019re not going to have access to the women\u2019s sleeping spaces and the women\u2019s bathrooms,\u201d Keith told me. Last February, Keith was to be a keynote speaker at the Public Interest Environmental Law Conference, at the University of Oregon, in Eugene, but the student government voted to condemn her, and more than a thousand people signed a petition demanding that the address be cancelled. Amid threats of violence, six policemen escorted Keith to the lectern, though, in the end, the protest proved peaceful: some audience members walked out and held a rally, leaving her to speak to a half-empty room. Keith had an easier time at Radfems Respond, where she spoke on the differences between radicalism and liberalism.

A men\u2019s-rights activist showed up\u2014he later posted mocking clips from a video that he had secretly made\u2014but said nothing during the sessions. Several trans women arrived and sat at the back, but, in fact, they were there to express solidarity, having decided that the attacks on radical feminists were both out of control and misguided. One of them, a thin, forty-year-old blonde from the Bay Area, who blogs under the name Snowflake Especial, noted that all the violence against trans women that she\u2019s aware of was committed by men. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we dealing with them?\u201d she asked. Despite that surprising show of support, most of the speakers felt embattled. Heath Atom Russell gave the closing talk. A stocky woman, with curly turquoise hair and a bluish stubble shadow on her cheeks, she wore a T-shirt that read \u201cI Survived Testosterone Poisoning.\u201d At twenty-five, she is a \u201cdetransitioner,\u201d a person who once identified as transgender but no longer does. (Expert estimates of the number of transitioners who abandon their new gender range from fewer than one per cent to as many as five per cent.) Russell, a lesbian who grew up in a conservative Baptist family in Southern California, began transitioning to male as a student at Humboldt State University, and was embraced by gender-rights groups on campus. She started taking hormones and changed her name. Then, in her senior year, she discovered \u201cUnpacking Queer Politics\u201d (2003), by Sheila Jeffreys, which critiques female-to-male transsexualism as capitulation to misogyny. At first, the book infuriated Russell, but she couldn\u2019t let go of the questions that it raised about her own identity. She had been having heart palpitations, which made her uneasy about the hormones she was taking. Nor did she ever fully believe herself to be male. At one point during her transition, she hooked up with a middle-aged trans woman. Russell knew that she was supposed to think of herself as a man with a woman, but, she said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right, and I was scared.\u201d Eventually, she proclaimed herself a woman again, and a radical feminist, though it meant being ostracized by many of her friends. She is now engaged to a woman; someone keyed the word \u201cdyke\u201d on her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s car. Russell appears in Sheila Jeffreys\u2019s new book, \u201cGender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism.\u201d Jeffreys, who is sixty-six, has short silver hair and a weathered face. She has taught at the University of Melbourne for twenty-three years, but she grew up in London, and has been described as the Andrea Dworkin of the U.K. She has written nine previous books, all of which focus on the sexual subjugation of women, whether through rape, incest, pornography, prostitution, or Western beauty norms. Like Dworkin, she is viewed as a heroine by a cadre of like-minded admirers and as a zealot by others. In 2005, in an admiring feature in the Guardian, Julie Bindel wrote, \u201cJeffreys sees sexuality as the basis of the oppression of women by men, in much the same way as Marx saw capitalism as the scourge of the working class. This unwavering belief has made her many enemies. Postmodern theorist Judith Halberstam once said, \u2018If Sheila Jeffreys did not exist, Camille Paglia would have had to invent her.\u2019 \u201d In eight brisk chapters (half of them written with Jeffreys\u2019s former Ph.D. student Lorene Gottschalk), \u201cGender Hurts\u201d offers Jeffreys\u2019s first full-length treatment of transgenderism. Ordinarily, Jeffreys told me, she would launch the publication of a new book with an event at the university, but this time campus security warned against it. She has also taken her name off her office door. She gave a talk in London this month, but it was invitation-only. In the book, Jeffreys calls detransitioners like Russell \u201csurvivors,\u201d and cites them as evidence that transgenderism isn\u2019t immutable and thus doesn\u2019t warrant radical medical intervention. (She considers gender-reassignment surgery a form of mutilation.) \u201cThe phenomenon of regret undermines the idea that there exists a particular kind of person who is genuinely and essentially transgender and can be identified accurately by psychiatrists,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is radically destabilising to the transgender project.\u201d She cites as further evidence the case of Bradley Cooper, who, in 2011, at the age of seventeen, became Britain\n\nquestion: What is Shirley Temple known for in the feminist movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1056}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Jeffreys is especially alarmed by doctors in Europe, Australia, and the United States who treat transgender children with puberty-delaying drugs, which prevent them from developing unwanted secondary sex characteristics and can result in sterilization. Throughout the book, Jeffreys insists on using male pronouns to refer to trans women and female ones to refer to trans men. \u201cUse by men of feminine pronouns conceals the masculine privilege bestowed upon them by virtue of having been placed in and brought up in the male sex caste,\u201d she writes. To her critics, the book becomes particularly hateful when she tries to account for the reality of trans people. Explaining female-to-male transition is fairly easy for her (and for other radical feminists): women seek to become men in order to raise their status in a sexist system. Heath Atom Russell, for example, is quoted as attributing her former desire to become a man to the absence of a \u201cproud woman loving culture.\u201d But, if that\u2019s true, why would men demote themselves to womanhood? For reasons of sexual fetishism, Jeffreys says. She substantiates her argument with the highly controversial theories of Ray Blanchard, a retired professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the related work of J. Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University. Contrary to widespread belief, Blanchard says, the majority of trans women in the West start off not as effeminate gay men but as straight or bisexual men, and they are initially motivated by erotic compulsion rather than by any conceived female identity. \u201cThe core is, it\u2019s really exciting for guys to imagine themselves with female breasts, or female breasts and a vulva,\u201d he told me. To describe the syndrome, Blanchard coined the term \u201cautogynephilia,\u201d meaning sexual arousal at the thought of oneself as female. Blanchard is far from a radical feminist. He believes that gender-reassignment surgery can relieve psychological suffering; he has even counselled people who undergo it. He also accepts the commonly held view that male brains differ from female brains in ways that affect behavior. Nevertheless, Jeffreys believes that the work of Blanchard and Bailey shows that when trans women ask to be accepted as women they\u2019re seeking to have an erotic fixation indulged. The last time a feminist of any standing published an attack on transgenderism as caustic as \u201cGender Hurts\u201d was in 1979, when Janice Raymond produced \u201cThe Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.\u201d Raymond was a lesbian ex-nun who became a doctoral student of the radical-feminist theologian Mary Daly, at Boston College. Inspired by the women\u2019s-health movement, Raymond framed much of \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d as a critique of a patriarchal medical and psychiatric establishment. Still, the book was frequently febrile, particularly with regard to lesbian trans women. \u201cAll transsexuals rape women\u2019s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves,\u201d Raymond wrote. \u201cHowever, the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist violates women\u2019s sexuality and spirit.\u201d It\u2019s a measure of how much perceptions have changed in the past thirty-five years that \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d received a respectful, even admiring hearing in the mainstream media, unlike \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d which has been largely ignored there. Reviewing \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d in the Times, the psychiatrist Thomas Szasz called it \u201cflawless.\u201d Raymond, he wrote, \u201chas rightly seized on transsexualism as an emblem of modern society\u2019s unremitting\u2014though increasingly concealed\u2014antifeminism.\u201d One of the women Raymond wrote about was Sandy Stone, a performance artist and academic who this fall will teach digital arts and new media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. When Raymond\u2019s book was published, Stone was a recording engineer at Olivia Records, a women\u2019s-music collective in Los Angeles. In the late sixties, after graduating from college, and while still living as a man, she had bluffed her way into a job at New York\u2019s famed Record Plant recording studio, where she worked with Jimi Hendrix and the Velvet Underground. (For a time, she slept in the studio basement, on a pile of Hendrix\u2019s capes.) She moved to the West Coast and transitioned in 1974. Olivia approached her soon afterward; experienced female recording engineers were hard to find. Stone became a member of the collective the next year and moved into a communal house that it rented, where she was the only trans woman among a dozen or so other lesbians.

She eventually earned a doctorate in philosophy at Santa Cruz. In 1987, Stone wrote an essay, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto,\u201d which is widely seen as the founding text of transgender studies. It\u2019s still taught around the world; a second French edition is about to be published, and Stone has received a request to allow a Catalan translation. The last time that Janice Raymond wrote on transgender issues was in 1994, for a new introduction to \u201cThe Transsexual Empire.\u201d Since then, she has focussed on sex trafficking, and last August a Norwegian government agency invited her to Oslo to speak on a panel about prostitution legislation. When she arrived, however, an official informed her that she had been disinvited; a letter to the editor of a major Norwegian newspaper had accused her of transphobia. Raymond says that similar things have \u201chappened much more frequently within the last couple of years.\u201d The most dramatic change in the perception of transgenderism can be seen in academia. Particularly at liberal-arts colleges, students are now routinely asked which gender pronoun they would prefer to be addressed by: choices might include \u201cze,\u201d \u201cou,\u201d \u201chir,\u201d \u201cthey,\u201d or even \u201cit.\u201d A decade ago, no university offered a student health plan that covered gender-reassignment surgery. Today, dozens do, including Harvard, Brown, Duke, Yale, Stanford, and the schools in the University of California system. There are young transgender-critical radical feminists, like Heath Atom Russell and Rachel Ivey, aged twenty-four, who was one of the organizers of Radfems Respond, but they are the first to admit that they\u2019re a minority. \u201cIf I were to say in a typical women\u2019s-studies class today, \u2018Female people are oppressed on the basis of reproduction,\u2019 I would get called out,\u201d Ivey says. Other students, she adds, would ask, \u201cWhat about women who are male?\u201d That might be an exaggeration, but only a slight one. The members of the board of the New York Abortion Access Fund, an all-volunteer group that helps to pay for abortions for those who can\u2019t afford them, are mostly young women; Alison Turkos, the group\u2019s co-chair, is twenty-six. In May, they voted unanimously to stop using the word \u201cwomen\u201d when talking about people who get pregnant, so as not to exclude trans men. \u201cWe recognize that people who identify as men can become pregnant and seek abortions,\u201d the group\u2019s new Statement of Values says. A Change.org petition asks NARAL and Planned Parenthood to adopt similarly gender-inclusive language. It specifically criticizes the hashtag #StandWithTexasWomen, which ricocheted around Twitter during State Senator Wendy Davis\u2019s filibuster against an anti-abortion bill in her state, and the phrase \u201cTrust Women,\u201d which was the slogan of George Tiller, the doctor and abortion provider who was murdered in Wichita in 2009. To some younger activists, it seems obvious that anyone who objects to such changes is simply clinging to the privilege inherent in being cisgender, a word popularized in the nineteen-nineties to mean any person who is not transgender. Alison Turkos has heard complaints that the new language obscures the fact that cisgender women overwhelmingly bear the brunt of the current political attacks on reproductive rights. She replies, \u201cIt may not feel comfortable, but it\u2019s important to create a space for more people who are often denied space and visibility.\u201d Older feminists who have not yet adopted this way of thinking can find themselves experiencing ideological whiplash. Sara St. Martin Lynne, a forty-year-old filmmaker and video producer from Oakland, told me, \u201cWhen you come from a liberation, leftist background, you want to be on the right side of history,\u201d and the debate \u201ckind of puts you through your paces.\u201d Last year, she was asked to resign from the board of Bay Area Girls Rock Camp, a nonprofit that \u201cempowers girls through music,\u201d because of her involvement with the Michigan Womyn\u2019s Music Festival, which bills itself as an event for \u201cwomyn-born womyn\n\nquestion: What is Shirley Temple known for in the feminist movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1032}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Michfest, as it\u2019s called, takes place every August, on six hundred and fifty acres of land in the woods east of Lake Michigan. Lisa Vogel founded it in 1976, when she was a nineteen-year-old Central Michigan University student, and she still runs it. The music, Vogel says, is only part of what makes Michfest important. Each year, several thousand women set up camp there and find themselves, for a week, living in a matriarchy. Meals are cooked in kitchen tents and eaten communally. There are workshops and classes. Some women don extravagant costumes; others wear nothing at all. There is free child care and a team to assist disabled women who ordinarily cannot go camping. Vogel describes the governing ethos as \u201cHow would a town look if we actually got to decide what was important?\u201d She told me, \u201cThere\u2019s something that I experience on the land when I walk at night without a flashlight in the woods and recognize that for that moment I feel completely safe. And there\u2019s nowhere else I can do that.\u201d She continued, \u201cIf, tomorrow, we said everyone is welcome, I\u2019m sure it would still be a really cool event, but that piece that allows women to let down their guard and feel that really deep sense of personal liberation would be different, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about.\u201d To transgender activists, Vogel\u2019s stance is laden with offensive assumptions: that trans women are different in an essential way from other women, and that they\u2019re dangerous. \u201cThe trope of trans women\u201d constituting \u201ca threat to women\u2019s spaces has been tossed around forever,\u201d Julia Serano told me. To her, it\u2019s akin to straight people refusing to share a locker room with gays or lesbians. Serano, forty-six, is a biologist by training who now spends most of her time writing and speaking on transgender issues and feminism; last year, she lectured at schools including Brown, Stanford, Smith, and Cornell. (Sheila Jeffreys attacks her in \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d using autobiographical details from Serano\u2019s first book, \u201cWhipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity\u201d (2007), to paint her as an autogynephile who seeks to \u201creinvent \u2018feminism\u2019 to fit his erotic interests.\u201d) In the summer of 2003, Serano joined about a hundred people at Camp Trans, a protest camp near the Michfest site, which has run intermittently since 1994. Serano said that relations with Michfest attendees were often unexpectedly cordial. A few years ago, though, Vogel says, some protesters committed acts of vandalism\u2014stealing electrical cables, cutting water pipes, keying cars in the parking lot, and spray-painting a six-foot penis, and the words \u201cReal Women Have Dicks,\u201d on the side of the main kitchen tent. Since then, as with the case of Olivia Records, the demonstrations have been supplanted by a boycott campaign. Last year, the Indigo Girls, longtime regulars at Michfest, announced that they wouldn\u2019t appear again until the event became trans-inclusive. This year, the scheduled headliners, Hunter Valentine, pulled out for the same reason. Performers who do appear face protests and boycotts of their own; the funk singer Shelley Nicole says that her band, blaKb\u00fcshe, was dropped from a show in Brooklyn because it is playing at Michfest next month. Before Sara St. Martin Lynne was asked to leave the Bay Area Girls Rock Camp board, she hadn\u2019t identified closely with radical feminism. Yet, as the campaign against Michfest\u2014and against radical feminism as a whole\u2014has grown, she\u2019s come to feel strongly about keeping the event \u201cwomyn-born-womyn.\u201d She said, \u201cThis moment where we\u2019re losing the ability to say the word \u2018woman\u2019 or to acknowledge the fact that being born female has lived consequences and meaning is kind of intense to me.\u201d One of the trans women who showed up at the Radfems Respond conference, a thirty-five-year-old software engineer from California, with a tiny nose stud and long brown hair, agrees. She understands why trans women are hurt by their exclusion from Michfest and other female-only events and facilities, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not really wanting to invade space. It\u2019s a deep-seated wanting to belong.\u201d But, she adds, \u201cif you\u2019re identifying with women, shouldn\u2019t you be empathizing with women?\u201d Sandy Stone shares this view\u2014up to a point.

Although it was CBS's answer to NBC's A Date with Judy, it was also broadcast by NBC in 1948 as a summer replacement for The Bob Hope Show. From October 3, 1952, to June 26, 1953, it aired on ABC, finally returning to CBS. Despite the program's long run, fewer than 24 episodes are known to exist. Priscilla Lyon and Janet Waldo successively portrayed 15-year-old Corliss on radio. Lugene Sanders also played Corliss briefly on radio and in the CBS version of the Meet Corliss Archer television show. Perpetually perky, breathless and well-intentioned, Corliss is constantly at the side of her next-door neighbor and boyfriend, Dexter Franklin (Bill Christy, Sam Edwards). Clumsy, nerdy Dexter, a sweet but constant bungler with a nasal voice, is best remembered for his trademark phrase, \"Holy cow!\" and his braying call, \"Heyyyy, Corrrrrliiiiiss!\"\u2014frequently delivered from the hedge separating their houses. Harry Archer, Corliss's father, is a lawyer who tolerates Dexter only when he wants to use him to help flaunt male superiority. Gruff but gentle, he was played by Bob Bailey, Fred Shields and Frank Martin. Janet Archer, Corliss's mother, was played by, successively, Irene Tedrow, Monty Margetts and Gloria Holden. She is calm and understanding with her daughter and her husband, both of whom sometimes try her patience. Other frequent characters include Mildred Ames, a good friend of Corliss (played by Bebe Young and Barbara Whiting); Mildred's irritating younger brother Raymond (Tommy Bernard, Kenny Godkin); and Corliss's rival, Betty Cameron (Delores Crane). Meet Corliss Archer was written by F. Hugh Herbert, who first introduced the character and her friends in a Good Housekeeping magazine story \"A Private Affair,\" the first of a series of stories. Kiss and Tell was a 1943 play that was adapted for a 1945 film starring Shirley Temple. The 1949 sequel, A Kiss for Corliss, was re-released in 1954. Herbert's Meet Corliss Archer property was adapted to television in 1951 and 1952 with live broadcasts produced and aired by CBS. In 1954 and 1955 Ziv Television Programs produced a syndicated telefilm series starring Ann Baker and Mary Brian. One of the show's unique features was the occasional cut to a comic-book-style drawing, with announcer's commentary, that illustrated the current story situation and was used several times during each episode. The program was produced by Ziv Productions. Several episodes of the Ziv version are available on DVD, and some are also available from the Internet Archive. Robin Morgan portrayed Corliss in a live telecast of Kiss and Tell on The Alcoa Hour (August 5, 1956), with Warren Berlinger as Dexter. Radio listeners had to use their imaginations to visualize Corliss, her friends and her town. But those imaginations got a boost in 1948 when the Meet Corliss Archer comic book, published by Fox Feature Syndicate, came out in three issues from March to July 1948. Al Feldstein (Albert B. Feldstein), later the editor of Mad, was a key writer and illustrator of this short-lived comic book series, which is now remembered primarily for his artwork in general and the good girl art covers in particular. Film strips and radio microphones on the front cover indicated the tie-ins and media crossovers. Janet Waldo was depicted on the front cover twice, as herself and as Corliss.\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan's role in the American Women's Movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 903}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since the early 1960s, she has been a key radical feminist member of the American Women's Movement, and a leader in the international feminist movement. Her 1970 anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful was cited by the New York Public Library as \"One of the 100 Most Influential Books of the 20th Century.\". She has written more than 20 books of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, and was editor of Ms. magazine. During the 1960s, she participated in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements; in the late 1960s, she was a founding member of radical feminist organizations such as New York Radical Women and W.I.T.C.H. She founded or co-founded the Feminist Women's Health Network, the National Battered Women's Refuge Network, Media Women, the National Network of Rape Crisis Centers, the Feminist Writers' Guild, the Women's Foreign Policy Council, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, GlobalSister.org, and Greenstone Women's Radio Network. She also co-founded the Women's Media Center with activist Gloria Steinem and actor/activist Jane Fonda. In 2018, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women. Due to circumstances at her birth, her mother claimed that Robin Morgan was born a year later than she actually was (see birth and parents), and throughout her career as a child actor, she was thought to be a year younger than she actually was, both by herself and others. Already as a toddler, her mother, Faith, and mother's sister Sally started Robin as a child model. At the age of five, believed to be four, she got her own program, titled Little Robin Morgan, on the New York radio station WOR. She was also a regular on the original network radio version of Juvenile Jury. Her acting career took off when she was eight and started in the TV series Mama, as Dagmar Hansen, the younger sister in the family depicted in the series. The show premiered on CBS in 1949, starring Peggy Wood, and was a great success. Morgan played Cecchina Cabrini in Citizen Saint (1947). During the Golden Age of Television, Morgan starred in such \"TV spectaculars\" as Kiss and Tell and Alice in Wonderland, and guest starred on such live dramas as Omnibus, Suspense, Danger, Hallmark Hall of Fame, Robert Montgomery Presents, Tales of Tomorrow, and Kraft Theatre. She worked with directors such as Sidney Lumet, John Frankenheimer, Ralph Nelson; writers such as Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling; and performed with actors such as Boris Karloff, Rosalind Russell, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, and Cliff Robertson. Having wanted to write rather than to act since she was four, Morgan fought her mother's efforts to keep her in show business, and left the cast of Mama at age 14. As she entered adulthood, Robin Morgan continued her education as a non-matriculating student at Columbia University. She began working as a secretary at Curtis Brown Literary Agency, where she met and worked with such writers as poet W. H. Auden in the early 1960s. She had already begun publishing her own poetry (later collected in her first book of poems, Monster, published in 1972). Throughout the next decades, along with political activism, writing fiction and nonfiction prose, and lecturing at colleges and universities on women's rights, Morgan continued to write and publish poetry. In 1962, Morgan married poet Kenneth Pitchford. She gave birth to their son, Blake Morgan, in 1969. The couple divorced in 1983. At that time, she was working as an editor at Grove Press and was involved in an attempt to unionize the publishing industry. When Grove summarily fired her and other union sympathizers, she led a seizure and occupation of their offices in the spring of 1970, protesting the union-busting, as well as the dishonest accounting of royalties to Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow. Morgan and eight other women were arrested that day. In the mid-1970s Morgan became a Contributing Editor to Ms. magazine, and continued her affiliation there as a part- or full-time editor in the following decades. She served as editor-in-chief of the magazine from 1989 to 1994, turning it into a highly successful, ad-free, bimonthly, international publication, which won awards for both writing and design, and received considerable acclaim among journalists. In 1979, when the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed, featuring famous women from politics, media and entertainment, culture, sports, and other areas of achievement, one of the cards featured Morgan's name and picture. Today, the trading cards are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the University of Iowa library. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan's role in the American Women's Movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "She has been a key radical feminist member of the American Women's Movement.", "usage": 1155}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Seven years later, in 2012, she debuted a weekly radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live With Robin Morgan. The broadcast is syndicated in the US and, as a podcast, is published online at the WMCLive website, and distributed on iTunes in 110 countries. It has been praised by The Huffington Post as \"talk radio with a brain\" and features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. The weekly hour was picked up by CBS Radio two weeks after its launch and is broadcast on CBS affiliate WJFK each Saturday. The program features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. By 1962 Morgan had become active in the anti-war Left, and had also contributed articles and poetry to such Left-wing and counter-culture journals as Liberation, Rat, Win, and The National Guardian. In the 1960s she became increasingly involved in social-justice movements, notably the civil-rights and anti-Vietnam war. In early 1967, she was active in the Youth International Party (known in the media as the \"Yippies\"), with Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner. However, tensions over sexism within the YIP (and the New Left in general) came to a head when Morgan grew more involved in Women's Liberation and contemporary feminism. In 1967, Morgan became a founding member of the short-lived New York Radical Women group. She was the key organizer of their September 1968 inaugural protest of the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City. Morgan wrote the Miss America protest pamphlet No More Miss America!, and that same year cofounded Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.), a radical feminist group that used public street theater (called \"hexes\" or \"zaps\") to call attention to sexism. Morgan designed the universal symbol of the women\u2019s movement\u2013\u2013the female symbol, a circle with a cross beneath, centered with a raised fist. The Oxford English Dictionary also credits her with first using the term \"herstory\" in print in her 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful. Concerning the feminist organization W.I.T.C.H., Morgan wrote: With the royalties from her anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful, Morgan founded the first feminist grant-giving foundation in the US: The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, which provided seed money to many early women's groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s. She made a decisive break from what she described as the \"male Left\" when she led the women's takeover of the underground newspaper Rat in 1970, and listed the reasons for her break in the first women's issue of the paper, in her essay titled \"Goodbye to All That\". The essay gained notoriety in the press for naming specific sexist men and institutions in the Left. Decades later, during the Democratic primaries for the 2008 presidential race, Morgan wrote a fiery sequel to her original essay, titled \"Goodbye To All That #2\", in defense of Hillary Clinton. The article quickly went viral on the internet for lambasting sexist rhetoric directed towards Clinton by the media. In 1977, Morgan became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Morgan has traveled extensively across the United States and around the world to bring attention to cross-cultural sexism. She has met with and interviewed female rebel fighters in the Philippines, Brazilian women activists in the slums/favelas of Rio, women organizers in the townships of South Africa, and underground feminists in Iran. Twice\u2013\u2013in 1986 and 1989 she spent months in the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, West Bank, and Gaza, to report on the conditions of women. Morgan has also spoken at universities and institutions in countries across Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America, as well as in Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. Over the years, Morgan has received numerous awards for her activism on women\u2019s rights. The Feminist Majority Foundation named Robin Morgan \"Woman of the Year\" in 1990; she received the Warrior Woman Award for Promoting Racial Understanding from The Asian American Women's National Organization in 1992; in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now, and in 2003 The Feminist Press gave her a \"Femmy\" Award for her \"service to literature\". She has also received the Humanist Heroine Award from The American Humanist Association in 2007. In March 2012 Morgan, along with her Women's Media Center co-founders Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem, wrote an open letter asking listeners to request\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan's role in the American Women's Movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1141}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They asked that stations licensed for public airwaves carrying Limbaugh be held accountable for contravening public interest as a continual promoter of hate speech against various disempowered and minority groups. In 1970, Morgan compiled, edited, and introduced the first anthology of feminist writings, Sisterhood is Powerful. The compilation included now-classic feminist essays by such activists as Naomi Weisstein, Kate Millett, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Florynce Kennedy, Frances M. Beal, Joreen, Marge Piercy, Lucinda Cisler and Mary Daly, as well as historical documents including the N.O.W. Bill of Rights, excerpts from the SCUM Manifesto, the Redstockings Manifesto, historical documents from W.I.T.C.H., and a germinal statement from the Black Women\u2019s Liberation Group of Mount Vernon. It also included what Morgan called \"verbal karate\": useful quotes and statistics about women. The anthology was cited by the New York Public Library as one of the \u201cNew York Public Library's Books of the  Century\u201d. Morgan established the first American feminist grant-giving organization, The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, with the royalties from Sisterhood Is Powerful. However, the anthology was banned in Chile, China, and South Africa. Her follow-up volume in 1984, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology, compiled articles about women in over seventy countries. That same year she founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, notable for being the first international feminist think tank. Repeatedly refusing the post of president, she was elected secretary of the organization from 1989 to 1993, was VP from 1993 to 1997, and after serving on the advisory board, finally agreed to become president in 2004. A third volume, Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium in 2003, was a collection of articles mostly by well-known feminists, both young and \"vintage\", in a retrospective on and future blueprint for the feminist movement. It was compiled, edited, and with an introduction by Morgan, and Morgan wrote \"To Vintage Feminists\" and \"To Younger Women\", which were both included in the anthology as Personal Postscripts. Morgan's articles, essays, reviews, interviews, political analyses, and investigative journalism have appeared widely in such publications as The Atlantic, Broadsheet, Chrysalis, Essence, Everywoman, The Feminist Art Journal, The Guardian (US), The Guardian (UK), The Hudson Review, the Los Angeles Times, Ms., The New Republic, The New York Times, Off Our Backs, Pacific Ways, The Second Wave, Sojourner, The Village Voice, The Voice of Women, and various United Nations periodicals, etc. Articles and essays have also appeared in reprint in international media, in English across the Commonwealth, and in translation in 13 languages in Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. Morgan has served as a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for many years, receiving the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism for her cover story titled \"The First Feminist Exiles from the USSR\" in 1981. She served as the magazine's editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, re-launching it as an ad-free, international bimonthly publication in 1991. This earned her a series of awards, including the award for Editorial Excellence by Utne Reader in 1991, and the Exceptional Merit in Journalism Award by the National Women's Political Caucus. Morgan resigned her post in 1994 to become Consulting Global Editor of the magazine, which she remains to this day. Morgan has written for online audiences and blogged frequently. Among her best known articles are \"Letters from Ground Zero\" (written and posted after the September 11 attacks in 2001 \u2014 which went viral), \"Goodbye To All That #2\", \"Women of the Arab Spring\", \"When Bad News is Good News: Notes of a Feminist News Junkie\", \"Manhood and Moral Waivers\", and \"Faith Healing: A Modest Proposal on Religious Fundamentalism\". Her online work is hosted in the archives of the Women's Media Center. Robin Morgan has published 21 books, including works of poetry, fiction, and the now-classic anthologies Sisterhood Is Powerful, Sisterhood Is Global, and Sisterhood Is Forever. Well before she was known as a feminist leader, literary magazines published her as a serious poet. According to a 1972 review of her first book of poems, Monster, in The Washington Post: \" establish Morgan as a poet of considerable means. There is a savage elegance, a richness of vocabulary, a thrust and steely polish..... A powerful, challenging book.\" In 1979 Morgan received a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in poetry,\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan's role in the American Women's Movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "secretary, VP, and president of Sisterhood Is Global Institute", "usage": 1154}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

During this time she worked on a cycle of verse plays. Morgan\u2019s poetry collections include A Hot January: Poems 1996\u20131999 (W. W. Norton, 1999), Depth Perception: New Poems and a Masque (Doubleday, 1994), Upstairs in the Garden: Poems Selected and New 1968\u20131988 (W. W. Norton, 1990), Death Benefits (Copper Canyon Press, 1981), Lady of the Beasts (Random House, 1976), and Monster (Random House, 1972). Of the book A Hot January, Alice Walker wrote: \"Morgan proves that exquisite poetry can be the most surprising gift of grief. A volume as proud, fierce, vulnerable, and brave as the poet herself.\" A review of Upstairs in the Garden, noted: \"As a vindication and celebration of the female experience, these inventive poems successfully wed feminist rhetoric with vivid imagery and sensitivity to the music of language.\" Two books of poems, Lady of the Beasts and Depth Perception, earned reviews in Poetry Magazine with critic Jay Parini stating that \"Robin Morgan will soon be regarded as one of our first-ranking poets.\" Morgan had published three books of fiction as of 2015. Her debut novel was the semi-autobiographical Dry Your Smile (published by Doubleday & Company, 1987), followed by The Mer-Child: A Legend for Children and Other Adults (published by The Feminist Press at City University of New York, 1991). Her most recent work of fiction is a historical novel titled The Burning Time (Melville House Books, 2006), set in the 14th century, based on court records of the first witchcraft trial in Ireland. The Burning Time was placed on the Recommended Quality Fiction List of 2007 by the American Library Association, in addition to being the 2006 Paperback Pick by Book Sense (The American Booksellers Association). Morgan has compiled, edited, and introduced several influential anthologies: Sisterhood Is Powerful: The Women\u2019s Liberation Anthology (1970), Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), and Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003). She has herself written non-fiction, including Going Too Far (1978), The Anatomy of Freedom (1984), The Demon Lover: On the Sexuality of Terrorism (1989), The Word of a Woman (1994), and Saturday\u2019s Child: A Memoir (2001). One of the most widely translated of Morgan\u2019s books and a best-seller, The Demon Lover is a commentary on the psychological and political roots of terrorism, and New York Times Book Review called it \"Important...compelling.... is intense and at times magnificent.\" Her most recently published book of non-fiction is Fighting Words: A Tool Kit for Combating the Religious Right (2006). In 1984, Morgan, together with the late Simone de Beauvoir of France, and women from 80 other countries, founded The Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI), an international non-profit NGO with consultative status to the United Nations, which has for three decades functioned as the world\u2019s first feminist think-tank. The Institute has played a leading policy-formulation, strategic, and activist role in the evolution of the international Women\u2019s Movement. SIGI has also developed a global communications network through which an umbrella of NGO interest, advice, contacts, and support is collectively mobilized to empower the global women\u2019s movement. Among its many activities, the Institute pioneered the first Urgent Acton Alerts regarding women\u2019s rights; the first Global Campaign To Make Visible Women\u2019s Unpaid Labor In National Accounts; and the first Women\u2019s Rights Manuals For Muslim Societies (in 12 languages). Its most recent project is Donor Direct Action (donordirectaction.org), which links front-line women\u2019s rights activists around the world to money, visibility, and popular support: minimum bureaucracy, maximum impact. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit progressive organization, The Women\u2019s Media Center with her friends actor/activist Jane Fonda, and activist Gloria Steinem. The focus of the organization is to make women powerful and visible in the media. An invited speaker at numerous universities in North America, Morgan has traveled\u2014as organizer, speaker, journalist\u2014across North America, Europe, and the Middle East to Australia, Brazil, the Caribbean, Central America, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. She has also been a guest professor or scholar in residence at a variety of academic institutions. She was guest chair for feminist studies at the New College of Florida in 1971; a visiting professor at The Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture at Rutgers University in 1987; a distinguished visiting scholar in residence for literary and cultural studies at the University of Canterbury, Christ\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan's role in the American Women's Movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "She co-founded The Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI).", "usage": 1137}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She was awarded an honorary degree as a Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs in 1992. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection that documents the personal, political, and professional aspects of Morgan's life, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. They date from the 1940s to the present. Robin Morgan has been arrested, and has received death threats from both the Right and the Left because of her activism. According to a New Yorker magazine article published in the aftermath of Morgan's essay \"Goodbye to All That\" (#2) going viral on the Internet, \"At five feet tall Morgan is, not for the first time, the little woman who has started a big war.\" In her original essay, \"Goodbye to All That\" (1970), Morgan bade adieu to \"the dream that being in the leadership collective will get you anything but gonorrhea,\" referring to the \"male Left\". She also asserted that Charles Manson was \"only the logical extreme of the normal American male\u2019s fantasy.\" Two years later, Morgan published the poem \"Arraignment\", in which she openly accused Ted Hughes of the battery and murder of Sylvia Plath. There were lawsuits, Morgan's 1972 book Monster which contained that poem was banned, and underground, pirated feminist editions of it were published. As the leading organizer of the 1968 protest of the Miss America Pageant, \"No More Miss America!\", Morgan attacked the pageant\u2019s \"ludicrous 'beauty' standards and also accused the pageant of being racist, since at that time no African American woman had been a contestant. In addition\u2013\u2013according to Morgan\u2013\u2013in sending pageant winners to entertain troops in Vietnam, the women served as \"death mascots\" in an immoral war. Morgan asked, \"Where else could one find such a perfect combination of American values -- racism, militarism, capitalism -- all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol, a woman.\" Another controversial quote is from her 1978 book, Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist, where she stated: \"I feel that \"man-hating\" is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.\" Morgan famously walked off The Tonight Show in 1969 when it screened vintage footage of her as a child actor while she was trying to speak seriously about the first national march against rape. Of the incident, she has been quoted as saying: \"Imagine talking about such a subject and having it trivialized like that.\" In 1974, with her phrase \"Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice\" (from her essay \"Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape\"), she became a central figure on one of the divisive issues in feminism, particularly among anti-pornography feminists in Anglophone countries. In 1973, Robin Morgan gave the keynote speech at the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in which she criticized Beth Elliott, a performer and organizer of the conference, for being a transgender woman. In this speech she referred to Elliott as a \"transsexual male\" and used male pronouns throughout, charging her with being \"an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer-with the mentality of a rapist.\" At the end of her speech she called for a vote on ejecting Elliott, with over two-thirds voting to allow her to remain, however the minority threatened to disrupt the conference and Elliott chose to leave after her performance to avoid this. The event demonstrated the high tension surrounding transgender women's involvement in the women's movement of the 1970s. Robin Morgan grew up in New York, first in Mount Vernon, and later in Manhattan, on Sutton Place. She graduated from The Wetter School in Mount Vernon, in 1956, and was privately tutored from then until 1959. She published her first serious poetry in literary magazines at age 17. In an article published in the Jewish Women's Archive, Morgan reveals she is of Jewish ancestry, but identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She is quoted as saying, \"When compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Ashkenazic (with a touch of Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\" Morgan continues to tackle topics such as religion, politics and sex in fiery commentaries on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan.

In 2000 Norton published Morgan\u2019s memoir, Saturday's Child, in which she wrote candidly about \"the shadowy circumstances of her birth; a lifelong, impassioned, love-hate relationship with her mother; her years as a famous child actor and her fight to escape show business to become a serious writer; her marriage to a fiery bisexual poet and how motherhood transformed her life; her years in the civil rights movement, the New Left, and counterculture; her emergence a leader of global feminism; and her love affairs with women as well as men,\" according to BookNews.com. In her book, \"her passion for writing, especially poetry, is vividly conveyed, as is her love and respect for her son, born in 1969,\" according to The New York Times Book Review. In April 2013, Morgan announced publicly that she had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, discussing the diagnosis on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan, revealing that she had been diagnosed in 2010, but that her quality of life was thus far \"normal\". Since her diagnosis, Morgan has become active with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation (PDF), completing training to become part of the organization's Parkinson's Advocates in Research initiative. In 2014 she was the catalyst and took a leadership role in PDF's new Women and PD initiative, which will seek to better serve women impacted by Parkinson's disease by understanding and resolving gender inequalities in PD research, treatment, and caregiver support. Morgan has also written new poetry inspired by her battle with the disease, and performed a reading of some of the poems as a TED Talk, at the TEDWomen 2015 conference. Her mother, Faith Berkeley Morgan, traveled from her New York residence to Florida to give birth, in order to avoid public scrutiny for her unmarried status. Robin's father, a medical doctor named Mates Morgenstern, did not accompany pregnant Faith on her trip. Until Morgan was 13 years old, her mother Faith claimed that Robin's father had been killed in World War II. However, Robin overheard conversations between her mother and aunt suggesting her father was alive. When she confronted her mother, Faith changed her story to assert that Robin's father had escaped from one Nazi concentration camp after another, and that she had saved his life by sponsoring his immigration to the United States where he had no family. Not until several years later did Robin get proof that this was also a lie. Morgan learned the truth, both about her father, who was still alive, and how old she really was, early in 1961. Now a young woman, no longer working in show business, Robin found a listing for the medical practice of an obstetrician, Dr. Mates Morgenstern, in the New Brunswick, New Jersey telephone directory. Suspecting this might be her father, she had sought a meeting with him, without her mother's knowledge, and ultimately paid a surprise visit to his New Jersey office in January 1961. Morgenstern revealed that he was aware of Robin's fame as a child actor, but had remained firm in his decision to avoid contact with Faith Morgan, having chosen not to see her again after the only time he visited her and the infant Robin. He also told Robin, during their conversation in his medical office, that she in fact was born on January 29, 1941, exactly one year earlier than she thought, and disclosed the copy of her original birth certificate, that he had stored in his office. In order to conceal the out-of-wedlock birth, Faith Morgan had asked her Florida obstetrician to sign an affidavit stating that the birth took place on January 29, 1942. During the conversation in his office, Morgenstern told his daughter that he first met her mother after his arrival in the United States, more than a year before the United States entered World War II, and that she had had nothing to do with his immigration. He added that he had known Faith only briefly and claimed that she had fantasized their relationship as more important than it was. By the time Morgan met her father he had married and had two sons with a woman he had known since they were both children in Austria. Having been separated by the war, they resumed their relationship after she arrived in the United States not long after Robin was born, which probably also added to Morgenstern's decision to abandon Faith and their daughter. Morgan only met her father once more, in February 1965 when he invited her and her husband to his New Jersey home. Morgenstern did not want his sons to know that they had a half-sister and Morgan acceded to his request that they tell his two sons that she was \"the daughter of an old friend.\" She refused to do so again, however, and never met him or her two half-brothers again. Morgan describes the two encounters that she had with her biological father in her autobiography, Saturday's Child: A Memoir.

Hugh Herbert. Kiss and Tell starred Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer and Judith Parrish as her friend Mildred Pringle. The play's great success led to offers from Hollywood for Caulfield, who left the production almost one year to the day from when it opened, and was replaced in her role by her sister Betty Caulfield. Kiss and Tell premiered at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston on March 1, 1943 for tryout performances before its Broadway run. It opened in New York City on March 17, 1943 at the Biltmore Theatre. It remained there until the end of 1944, before transferring to the Bijou Theatre in 1945. It ran for a total of 956 performances before closing on June 23, 1945. The original production was produced by George Abbott and written by F. Hugh Herbert. The cast included Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer, Jessie Royce Landis as Janet Archer, Frances Bavier as Louise, Walter Davis as Uncle George, John Harvey as Private Earhart, Lulu Mae Hubbard as Dorothy Pringle, Robert Keith as Harry Archer, James Lane as Mr. Willard, Tommy Lewis as Raymond Pringle, Robert Lynn as Robert Pringle, Judith Parrish as Mildred Pringle, Calvin Thomas as Bill Franklin, Paula Trueman as Mary Franklin, Robert White as Dexter Franklin, and Richard Widmark as Lieut. Lenny Archer. Two teenage girls become interested in boys, and the girls' parents are making more problems rather than solving them. A film version written by Herbert and based on his play was released by Columbia Pictures on October 4, 1945 with Shirley Temple in the role of Corliss Archer. The film was directed by Richard Wallace and produced by Sol C. Siegel. Temple would reprise the role in the film's sequel A Kiss for Corliss in 1949.\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan's role in the American Women's Movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 496}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In 1962 she became active in the civil rights and feminist movements, quickly becoming a leader. She worked as a contributing editor for Ms. Magazine for twenty years, serving as editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994. Her editing of the Sisterhood anthologies (beginning with Sisterhood Is Powerful in 1970) has a significant impact on the feminist movement. In 1984 Morgan founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, a think tank for women\u2019s rights worldwide. Morgan continues to write and lecture around the world in addition to hosting a weekly radio and online podcast and webcast program entitled \u201cWomen\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan.\u201d \u201cIf I had to name a single quality characteristic of patriarchy, it would be compartmentalization, the capacity for institutionalizing disconnection. Intellect severed from emotion. Thought separated from action. Science split from art. The earth itself divided\u2014national borders.... The personal isolated from the political. Sex divorced from love\u2026Law detached from justice\u2026If I had to name a single quality characteristic of global feminism, it would be connectivity\u2014a capacity dangerous to every status quo, because of its insistence on noticing.\u201d In her lifetime battle for women\u2019s dignity and global change, Robin Morgan uses words as ammunition, as one can see in the above quotation from The Word of a Woman (1992). As poet, novelist, journalist, lecturer, and feminist theorist, she expresses the reality of contemporary women\u2019s oppression. Morgan was born on January 29, 1941, daughter of Faith Berkeley Morgan, in Lake Worth, Florida. As a child, Morgan\u2019s mother told her that her father had been killed in World War II and later told her other false stories about his identity and fate. Morgan learned the true identity of her father, an obstetrician/gynecologist named Mates Morgenstern, in 1961 when she was nineteen years old. They met only once in person in 1965. When Morgan was not yet a year old, her mother entered her in baby contests and she began a career first as a child model, and later as a child actor and radio personality. She remained a public figure, starring in primetime dramas and specials as well as working on the stage, until the age of fourteen, when she left the limelight to do what she really wanted: to write. Though she never formally enrolled in college, Morgan attended (nonmatriculated) classes and lectures at Columbia University and remained in New York City. At the age of seventeen, she published her first serious poetry in a literary magazine. In 1962, Morgan married writer Kenneth Pitchford, whom she divorced in 1990. Together they had one son, Blake Morgan-Pitchford, born in 1969. Morgan identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She writes: \u201cWhen compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Jews of European origin and their descendants, including most of North and South American Jewry.Ashkenazic (with a touch of Descendants of the Jews who lived in Spain and Portugal before the explusion of 1492; primarily Jews of N. Africa, Italy, the Middle East and the Balkans.Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. And I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\u201d Morgan became an activist during the 1960s and was involved in the civil rights movement, SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee), and the anti-Vietnam War movement. She was also a founding member of New York Radical Women and other radical feminist organizations, such as W.I.T.C.H, which she co-founded in 1968. She was one of the key organizers of the 1968 protest at Atlantic City\u2019s Miss America Contest, which helped launch the second wave of United States feminism. She later reflected on the Miss America pageant, its practices, and the 1968 protest: \u201cwhere else could one find such a perfect combination of American values\u2014racism, militarism, capitalism\u2014all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol: a woman\u201d (Word of a Woman: Feminist Dispatches, 1968-1992). In the following decades, Morgan spearheaded the international women\u2019s liberation movement through her continued activism, her steadfast publishing of feminist poetry and prose, her work as a feminist journalist and editor, and her passionate international lecturing. Morgan coined the term \u201cherstory\u201d in her first published anthology, Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan's role in the American Women's Movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "She was also a founding member of New York Radical Women and other radical feminist organizations, such as W.I.T.C.H, which she co-founded in 1968.", "usage": 1147}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Morgan also funded The Sisterhood is Powerful Fund, the first feminist foundation in the United States, with royalties from Sisterhood is Powerful. In 1970, Morgan helped lead the women\u2019s takeover of Rat, a leftist newspaper. Women staffers at the paper and previous contributors like Morgan seized the paper for an issue and never gave it back. In the first women\u2019s issue of the paper, titled \u201cWomen Seize RAT! Sabotage Tales!,\u201d Morgan published what became the famous essay, \u201cGoodbye to All That,\u201d in which she addressed sexism on the Left and \u201cLeftist men\u2019s betrayal of women.\u201d Throughout her career, Morgan has traveled far and wide to interview women rebel fighters in the Philippines, Palestinian women activists in the Intifada, and women in postrevolutionary Iran. She was a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for twenty years, serving as its editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, when it was relaunched as an advertisement-free publication. Since August 2012, Morgan has hosted a nationally syndicated weekly American radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan, in which she discusses current events, interviews guests, produces in-depth investigative reports, and offers commentary on a host of contemporary issues. Morgan has written more than twenty books, including five books of poetry, two novels, and numerous books of essays. She is best known as editor of several important anthologies. Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings from the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement (1970) gives voice to American feminists of the 1960s. These raw and immediate essays cover topics such as female orgasm, the nature of prostitution, the lives of radical lesbians, and the challenge of being Black and female. Morgan\u2019s second groundbreaking edited volume, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), compiles articles about the status of women in seventy countries. In 1984 Morgan co-founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI) with Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986), bringing together the writers of the anthology at an organizing conference. SIGI functions as a think-tank on women\u2019s human rights worldwide. Morgan is also co-founder of The Women\u2019s Media Center with Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem. A third anthology, Sisterhood is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003) was a well-received collection of articles by prominent feminists in which Morgan exhorted both young and the \u201cvintage\u201d feminists to take credit for the astounding and irreversible revolution they brought about. Morgan has since published several further works of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including Fighting Words: A Toolkit for Combating the Religious Right (2006) and a novel, Parallax, published in 2019. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection documenting aspects of Morgan\u2019s political history, personal life, and professional works, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. Morgan has received numerous awards, including the National Endowment for the Arts prize in poetry, the 1990 Feminist Majority Foundation Woman of the Year Award, and the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism. She has also been awarded grants from the Ford Foundation and received prizes for her editorial excellence. In 1992, Morgan was awarded an Honorary Degree as Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs, and in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now. Morgan was also awarded a \u201cFemmy\u201d award from the Feminist Press in 2003 for her \u201cservice to literature\u201d and in 2007 was awarded a Humanist Heroine Award by the American Humanist Association.

The conference had been convened by a group that wanted to defend two positions that have made radical feminism anathema to much of the left. First, the organizers hoped to refute charges that the desire to ban prostitution implies hostility toward prostitutes. Then they were going to try to explain why, at a time when transgender rights are ascendant, radical feminists insist on regarding transgender women as men, who should not be allowed to use women\u2019s facilities, such as public rest rooms, or to participate in events organized exclusively for women. The dispute began more than forty years ago, at the height of the second-wave feminist movement. In one early skirmish, in 1973, the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in Los Angeles, furiously split over a scheduled performance by the folksinger Beth Elliott, who is what was then called a transsexual. Robin Morgan, the keynote speaker, said: I will not call a male \u201cshe\u201d; thirty-two years of suffering in this androcentric society, and of surviving, have earned me the title \u201cwoman\u201d; one walk down the street by a male transvestite, five minutes of his being hassled (which he may enjoy), and then he dares, he dares to think he understands our pain? No, in our mothers\u2019 names and in our own, we must not call him sister. Such views are shared by few feminists now, but they still have a foothold among some self-described radical feminists, who have found themselves in an acrimonious battle with trans people and their allies. Trans women say that they are women because they feel female\u2014that, as some put it, they have women\u2019s brains in men\u2019s bodies. Radical feminists reject the notion of a \u201cfemale brain.\u201d They believe that if women think and act differently from men it\u2019s because society forces them to, requiring them to be sexually attractive, nurturing, and deferential. In the words of Lierre Keith, a speaker at Radfems Respond, femininity is \u201critualized submission.\u201d In this view, gender is less an identity than a caste position. Anyone born a man retains male privilege in society; even if he chooses to live as a woman\u2014and accept a correspondingly subordinate social position\u2014the fact that he has a choice means that he can never understand what being a woman is really like. By extension, when trans women demand to be accepted as women they are simply exercising another form of male entitlement. All this enrages trans women and their allies, who point to the discrimination that trans people endure; although radical feminism is far from achieving all its goals, women have won far more formal equality than trans people have. In most states, it\u2019s legal to fire someone for being transgender, and transgender people can\u2019t serve in the military. A recent survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force found overwhelming levels of anti-trans violence and persecution. Forty-one per cent of respondents said that they had attempted suicide. Yet, at the same time, the trans-rights movement is growing in power and cachet: a recent Time cover featuring the actress Laverne Cox was headlined \u201cTHE TRANSGENDER TIPPING POINT.\u201d The very word \u201ctransgender,\u201d which first came into wide use in the nineteen-nineties, encompasses far more people than the term \u201ctranssexual\u201d did. It includes not just the small number of people who seek gender-reassignment surgery\u2014according to frequently cited estimates, about one in thirty thousand men and one in a hundred thousand women\u2014but also those who take hormones, or who simply identify with the opposite gender, or, in some cases, with both or with neither. (According to the National Center survey, most trans women have taken female hormones, but only about a quarter of them have had genital surgery.) The elasticity of the term \u201ctransgender\u201d has forced a rethinking of what sex and gender mean; at least in progressive circles, what\u2019s determinative isn\u2019t people\u2019s chromosomes or their genitals or the way that they were brought up but how they see themselves. Having rejected this supposition, radical feminists now find themselves in a position that few would have imagined when the conflict began: shunned as reactionaries on the wrong side of a sexual-rights issue. It is, to them, a baffling political inversion. Radfems Respond was originally to have taken place across town from the library, at a Quaker meeting house, but trans activists had launched a petition on Change\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan's role in the American Women's Movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1063}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They said that, in hosting it, the Quakers would alienate trans people and \u201cbe complicit in the violence against them.\u201d The Quakers, citing concerns in their community, revoked the agreement. It wasn\u2019t the first time that such an event had lost a scheduled venue. The Radfem 2012 conference was to be held in London, at Conway Hall, which bills itself as \u201ca hub for free speech and independent thought.\u201d But trans activists objected both to Radfem\u2019s women-only policy\u2014which was widely understood to exclude trans women\u2014and to the participation of Sheila Jeffreys, a professor of political science at the University of Melbourne. Jeffreys was scheduled to speak on prostitution, but she is a longtime critic of the transgender movement, and Conway Hall officials decided that they could not allow speakers who \u201cconflict with our ethos, principles, and culture.\u201d Ultimately, the event was held at a still secret location; organizers escorted delegates to it from a nearby meeting place. Radfem 2013 also had to switch locations, as did a gathering in Toronto last year, called Radfems Rise Up. In response, thirty-seven radical feminists, including major figures from the second wave, such as Ti-Grace Atkinson, Kathie Sarachild, and Michele Wallace, signed a statement titled \u201cForbidden Discourse: The Silencing of Feminist Criticism of \u2018Gender,\u2019 \u201d which described their \u201calarm\u201d at \u201cthreats and attacks, some of them physical, on individuals and organizations daring to challenge the currently fashionable concept of gender.\u201d With all this in mind, the Radfems Respond organizers had arranged the library space as a backup, but then a post on Portland Indymedia announced: We questioned the library administration about allowing a hate group who promotes discrimination and their response is that they cannot kick them out because of freedom of speech. So we also exercise our right to free speech in public space this Saturday to drive the TERFS and Radfems out of OUR library and OUR Portland! (TERF stands for \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminist.\u201d The term can be useful for making a distinction with radical feminists who do not share the same position, but those at whom it is directed consider it a slur.) Abusive posts proliferated on Twitter and, especially, Tumblr. One read, \u201c/kill/terfs 2K14.\u201d Another suggested, \u201chow about \u2018slowly and horrendously murder terfs in saw-like torture machines and contraptions\u2019 2K14.\u201d A young blogger holding a knife posted a selfie with the caption \u201cFetch me a terf.\u201d Such threats have become so common that radical-feminist Web sites have taken to cataloguing them. \u201cIt\u2019s aggrieved entitlement,\u201d Lierre Keith told me. \u201cThey are so angry that we will not see them as women.\u201d Keith is a writer and an activist who runs a small permaculture farm in Northern California. She is forty-nine, with cropped pewter hair and a uniform of black T-shirts and jeans. Three years ago, she co-founded the ecofeminist group Deep Green Resistance, which has some two hundred members and links the oppression of women to the pillaging of the planet. D.G.R. is defiantly militant, refusing to condemn the use of violence in the service of goals it considers just. In radical circles, though, what makes the group truly controversial is its stance on gender. As members see it, a person born with male privilege can no more shed it through surgery than a white person can claim an African-American identity simply by darkening his or her skin. Before D.G.R. held its first conference, in 2011, in Wisconsin, the group informed a person in the process of a male-to-female transition that she couldn\u2019t stay in the women\u2019s quarters. \u201cWe said, That\u2019s fine if you want to come, but, no, you\u2019re not going to have access to the women\u2019s sleeping spaces and the women\u2019s bathrooms,\u201d Keith told me. Last February, Keith was to be a keynote speaker at the Public Interest Environmental Law Conference, at the University of Oregon, in Eugene, but the student government voted to condemn her, and more than a thousand people signed a petition demanding that the address be cancelled. Amid threats of violence, six policemen escorted Keith to the lectern, though, in the end, the protest proved peaceful: some audience members walked out and held a rally, leaving her to speak to a half-empty room.

A men\u2019s-rights activist showed up\u2014he later posted mocking clips from a video that he had secretly made\u2014but said nothing during the sessions. Several trans women arrived and sat at the back, but, in fact, they were there to express solidarity, having decided that the attacks on radical feminists were both out of control and misguided. One of them, a thin, forty-year-old blonde from the Bay Area, who blogs under the name Snowflake Especial, noted that all the violence against trans women that she\u2019s aware of was committed by men. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we dealing with them?\u201d she asked. Despite that surprising show of support, most of the speakers felt embattled. Heath Atom Russell gave the closing talk. A stocky woman, with curly turquoise hair and a bluish stubble shadow on her cheeks, she wore a T-shirt that read \u201cI Survived Testosterone Poisoning.\u201d At twenty-five, she is a \u201cdetransitioner,\u201d a person who once identified as transgender but no longer does. (Expert estimates of the number of transitioners who abandon their new gender range from fewer than one per cent to as many as five per cent.) Russell, a lesbian who grew up in a conservative Baptist family in Southern California, began transitioning to male as a student at Humboldt State University, and was embraced by gender-rights groups on campus. She started taking hormones and changed her name. Then, in her senior year, she discovered \u201cUnpacking Queer Politics\u201d (2003), by Sheila Jeffreys, which critiques female-to-male transsexualism as capitulation to misogyny. At first, the book infuriated Russell, but she couldn\u2019t let go of the questions that it raised about her own identity. She had been having heart palpitations, which made her uneasy about the hormones she was taking. Nor did she ever fully believe herself to be male. At one point during her transition, she hooked up with a middle-aged trans woman. Russell knew that she was supposed to think of herself as a man with a woman, but, she said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right, and I was scared.\u201d Eventually, she proclaimed herself a woman again, and a radical feminist, though it meant being ostracized by many of her friends. She is now engaged to a woman; someone keyed the word \u201cdyke\u201d on her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s car. Russell appears in Sheila Jeffreys\u2019s new book, \u201cGender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism.\u201d Jeffreys, who is sixty-six, has short silver hair and a weathered face. She has taught at the University of Melbourne for twenty-three years, but she grew up in London, and has been described as the Andrea Dworkin of the U.K. She has written nine previous books, all of which focus on the sexual subjugation of women, whether through rape, incest, pornography, prostitution, or Western beauty norms. Like Dworkin, she is viewed as a heroine by a cadre of like-minded admirers and as a zealot by others. In 2005, in an admiring feature in the Guardian, Julie Bindel wrote, \u201cJeffreys sees sexuality as the basis of the oppression of women by men, in much the same way as Marx saw capitalism as the scourge of the working class. This unwavering belief has made her many enemies. Postmodern theorist Judith Halberstam once said, \u2018If Sheila Jeffreys did not exist, Camille Paglia would have had to invent her.\u2019 \u201d In eight brisk chapters (half of them written with Jeffreys\u2019s former Ph.D. student Lorene Gottschalk), \u201cGender Hurts\u201d offers Jeffreys\u2019s first full-length treatment of transgenderism. Ordinarily, Jeffreys told me, she would launch the publication of a new book with an event at the university, but this time campus security warned against it. She has also taken her name off her office door. She gave a talk in London this month, but it was invitation-only. In the book, Jeffreys calls detransitioners like Russell \u201csurvivors,\u201d and cites them as evidence that transgenderism isn\u2019t immutable and thus doesn\u2019t warrant radical medical intervention. (She considers gender-reassignment surgery a form of mutilation.) \u201cThe phenomenon of regret undermines the idea that there exists a particular kind of person who is genuinely and essentially transgender and can be identified accurately by psychiatrists,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is radically destabilising to the transgender project.\u201d She cites as further evidence the case of Bradley Cooper, who, in 2011, at the age of seventeen, became Britain\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan's role in the American Women's Movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1058}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Jeffreys is especially alarmed by doctors in Europe, Australia, and the United States who treat transgender children with puberty-delaying drugs, which prevent them from developing unwanted secondary sex characteristics and can result in sterilization. Throughout the book, Jeffreys insists on using male pronouns to refer to trans women and female ones to refer to trans men. \u201cUse by men of feminine pronouns conceals the masculine privilege bestowed upon them by virtue of having been placed in and brought up in the male sex caste,\u201d she writes. To her critics, the book becomes particularly hateful when she tries to account for the reality of trans people. Explaining female-to-male transition is fairly easy for her (and for other radical feminists): women seek to become men in order to raise their status in a sexist system. Heath Atom Russell, for example, is quoted as attributing her former desire to become a man to the absence of a \u201cproud woman loving culture.\u201d But, if that\u2019s true, why would men demote themselves to womanhood? For reasons of sexual fetishism, Jeffreys says. She substantiates her argument with the highly controversial theories of Ray Blanchard, a retired professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the related work of J. Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University. Contrary to widespread belief, Blanchard says, the majority of trans women in the West start off not as effeminate gay men but as straight or bisexual men, and they are initially motivated by erotic compulsion rather than by any conceived female identity. \u201cThe core is, it\u2019s really exciting for guys to imagine themselves with female breasts, or female breasts and a vulva,\u201d he told me. To describe the syndrome, Blanchard coined the term \u201cautogynephilia,\u201d meaning sexual arousal at the thought of oneself as female. Blanchard is far from a radical feminist. He believes that gender-reassignment surgery can relieve psychological suffering; he has even counselled people who undergo it. He also accepts the commonly held view that male brains differ from female brains in ways that affect behavior. Nevertheless, Jeffreys believes that the work of Blanchard and Bailey shows that when trans women ask to be accepted as women they\u2019re seeking to have an erotic fixation indulged. The last time a feminist of any standing published an attack on transgenderism as caustic as \u201cGender Hurts\u201d was in 1979, when Janice Raymond produced \u201cThe Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.\u201d Raymond was a lesbian ex-nun who became a doctoral student of the radical-feminist theologian Mary Daly, at Boston College. Inspired by the women\u2019s-health movement, Raymond framed much of \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d as a critique of a patriarchal medical and psychiatric establishment. Still, the book was frequently febrile, particularly with regard to lesbian trans women. \u201cAll transsexuals rape women\u2019s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves,\u201d Raymond wrote. \u201cHowever, the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist violates women\u2019s sexuality and spirit.\u201d It\u2019s a measure of how much perceptions have changed in the past thirty-five years that \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d received a respectful, even admiring hearing in the mainstream media, unlike \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d which has been largely ignored there. Reviewing \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d in the Times, the psychiatrist Thomas Szasz called it \u201cflawless.\u201d Raymond, he wrote, \u201chas rightly seized on transsexualism as an emblem of modern society\u2019s unremitting\u2014though increasingly concealed\u2014antifeminism.\u201d One of the women Raymond wrote about was Sandy Stone, a performance artist and academic who this fall will teach digital arts and new media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. When Raymond\u2019s book was published, Stone was a recording engineer at Olivia Records, a women\u2019s-music collective in Los Angeles. In the late sixties, after graduating from college, and while still living as a man, she had bluffed her way into a job at New York\u2019s famed Record Plant recording studio, where she worked with Jimi Hendrix and the Velvet Underground. (For a time, she slept in the studio basement, on a pile of Hendrix\u2019s capes.) She moved to the West Coast and transitioned in 1974. Olivia approached her soon afterward; experienced female recording engineers were hard to find. Stone became a member of the collective the next year and moved into a communal house that it rented, where she was the only trans woman among a dozen or so other lesbians.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Actresses of \"Kiss and Tell\" and their Government Positions\n\nevidence:  \u201cThe Transsexual Empire,\u201d her presence was a major source of controversy in lesbian-feminist circles, but Stone insists that it was Raymond who created the dissension. \u201cWhen the book came out, we were deluged with hate mail,\u201d Stone says. \u201cUp to that point, we were pretty much happy campers, making our music and doing our political work.\u201d Stone received death threats, but ultimately it was the threat of a boycott that drove her out of the collective. She eventually earned a doctorate in philosophy at Santa Cruz. In 1987, Stone wrote an essay, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto,\u201d which is widely seen as the founding text of transgender studies. It\u2019s still taught around the world; a second French edition is about to be published, and Stone has received a request to allow a Catalan translation. The last time that Janice Raymond wrote on transgender issues was in 1994, for a new introduction to \u201cThe Transsexual Empire.\u201d Since then, she has focussed on sex trafficking, and last August a Norwegian government agency invited her to Oslo to speak on a panel about prostitution legislation. When she arrived, however, an official informed her that she had been disinvited; a letter to the editor of a major Norwegian newspaper had accused her of transphobia. Raymond says that similar things have \u201chappened much more frequently within the last couple of years.\u201d The most dramatic change in the perception of transgenderism can be seen in academia. Particularly at liberal-arts colleges, students are now routinely asked which gender pronoun they would prefer to be addressed by: choices might include \u201cze,\u201d \u201cou,\u201d \u201chir,\u201d \u201cthey,\u201d or even \u201cit.\u201d A decade ago, no university offered a student health plan that covered gender-reassignment surgery. Today, dozens do, including Harvard, Brown, Duke, Yale, Stanford, and the schools in the University of California system. There are young transgender-critical radical feminists, like Heath Atom Russell and Rachel Ivey, aged twenty-four, who was one of the organizers of Radfems Respond, but they are the first to admit that they\u2019re a minority. \u201cIf I were to say in a typical women\u2019s-studies class today, \u2018Female people are oppressed on the basis of reproduction,\u2019 I would get called out,\u201d Ivey says. Other students, she adds, would ask, \u201cWhat about women who are male?\u201d That might be an exaggeration, but only a slight one. The members of the board of the New York Abortion Access Fund, an all-volunteer group that helps to pay for abortions for those who can\u2019t afford them, are mostly young women; Alison Turkos, the group\u2019s co-chair, is twenty-six. In May, they voted unanimously to stop using the word \u201cwomen\u201d when talking about people who get pregnant, so as not to exclude trans men. \u201cWe recognize that people who identify as men can become pregnant and seek abortions,\u201d the group\u2019s new Statement of Values says. A Change.org petition asks NARAL and Planned Parenthood to adopt similarly gender-inclusive language. It specifically criticizes the hashtag #StandWithTexasWomen, which ricocheted around Twitter during State Senator Wendy Davis\u2019s filibuster against an anti-abortion bill in her state, and the phrase \u201cTrust Women,\u201d which was the slogan of George Tiller, the doctor and abortion provider who was murdered in Wichita in 2009. To some younger activists, it seems obvious that anyone who objects to such changes is simply clinging to the privilege inherent in being cisgender, a word popularized in the nineteen-nineties to mean any person who is not transgender. Alison Turkos has heard complaints that the new language obscures the fact that cisgender women overwhelmingly bear the brunt of the current political attacks on reproductive rights. She replies, \u201cIt may not feel comfortable, but it\u2019s important to create a space for more people who are often denied space and visibility.\u201d Older feminists who have not yet adopted this way of thinking can find themselves experiencing ideological whiplash. Sara St. Martin Lynne, a forty-year-old filmmaker and video producer from Oakland, told me, \u201cWhen you come from a liberation, leftist background, you want to be on the right side of history,\u201d and the debate \u201ckind of puts you through your paces.\u201d Last year, she was asked to resign from the board of Bay Area Girls Rock Camp, a nonprofit that \u201cempowers girls through music,\u201d because of her involvement with the Michigan Womyn\u2019s Music Festival, which bills itself as an event for \u201cwomyn-born womyn\n\nquestion: What is Robin Morgan's role in the American Women's Movement?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1034}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Michfest, as it\u2019s called, takes place every August, on six hundred and fifty acres of land in the woods east of Lake Michigan. Lisa Vogel founded it in 1976, when she was a nineteen-year-old Central Michigan University student, and she still runs it. The music, Vogel says, is only part of what makes Michfest important. Each year, several thousand women set up camp there and find themselves, for a week, living in a matriarchy. Meals are cooked in kitchen tents and eaten communally. There are workshops and classes. Some women don extravagant costumes; others wear nothing at all. There is free child care and a team to assist disabled women who ordinarily cannot go camping. Vogel describes the governing ethos as \u201cHow would a town look if we actually got to decide what was important?\u201d She told me, \u201cThere\u2019s something that I experience on the land when I walk at night without a flashlight in the woods and recognize that for that moment I feel completely safe. And there\u2019s nowhere else I can do that.\u201d She continued, \u201cIf, tomorrow, we said everyone is welcome, I\u2019m sure it would still be a really cool event, but that piece that allows women to let down their guard and feel that really deep sense of personal liberation would be different, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about.\u201d To transgender activists, Vogel\u2019s stance is laden with offensive assumptions: that trans women are different in an essential way from other women, and that they\u2019re dangerous. \u201cThe trope of trans women\u201d constituting \u201ca threat to women\u2019s spaces has been tossed around forever,\u201d Julia Serano told me. To her, it\u2019s akin to straight people refusing to share a locker room with gays or lesbians. Serano, forty-six, is a biologist by training who now spends most of her time writing and speaking on transgender issues and feminism; last year, she lectured at schools including Brown, Stanford, Smith, and Cornell. (Sheila Jeffreys attacks her in \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d using autobiographical details from Serano\u2019s first book, \u201cWhipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity\u201d (2007), to paint her as an autogynephile who seeks to \u201creinvent \u2018feminism\u2019 to fit his erotic interests.\u201d) In the summer of 2003, Serano joined about a hundred people at Camp Trans, a protest camp near the Michfest site, which has run intermittently since 1994. Serano said that relations with Michfest attendees were often unexpectedly cordial. A few years ago, though, Vogel says, some protesters committed acts of vandalism\u2014stealing electrical cables, cutting water pipes, keying cars in the parking lot, and spray-painting a six-foot penis, and the words \u201cReal Women Have Dicks,\u201d on the side of the main kitchen tent. Since then, as with the case of Olivia Records, the demonstrations have been supplanted by a boycott campaign. Last year, the Indigo Girls, longtime regulars at Michfest, announced that they wouldn\u2019t appear again until the event became trans-inclusive. This year, the scheduled headliners, Hunter Valentine, pulled out for the same reason. Performers who do appear face protests and boycotts of their own; the funk singer Shelley Nicole says that her band, blaKb\u00fcshe, was dropped from a show in Brooklyn because it is playing at Michfest next month. Before Sara St. Martin Lynne was asked to leave the Bay Area Girls Rock Camp board, she hadn\u2019t identified closely with radical feminism. Yet, as the campaign against Michfest\u2014and against radical feminism as a whole\u2014has grown, she\u2019s come to feel strongly about keeping the event \u201cwomyn-born-womyn.\u201d She said, \u201cThis moment where we\u2019re losing the ability to say the word \u2018woman\u2019 or to acknowledge the fact that being born female has lived consequences and meaning is kind of intense to me.\u201d One of the trans women who showed up at the Radfems Respond conference, a thirty-five-year-old software engineer from California, with a tiny nose stud and long brown hair, agrees. She understands why trans women are hurt by their exclusion from Michfest and other female-only events and facilities, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not really wanting to invade space. It\u2019s a deep-seated wanting to belong.\u201d But, she adds, \u201cif you\u2019re identifying with women, shouldn\u2019t you be empathizing with women?\u201d Sandy Stone shares this view\u2014up to a point.

Although it was CBS's answer to NBC's A Date with Judy, it was also broadcast by NBC in 1948 as a summer replacement for The Bob Hope Show. From October 3, 1952, to June 26, 1953, it aired on ABC, finally returning to CBS. Despite the program's long run, fewer than 24 episodes are known to exist. Priscilla Lyon and Janet Waldo successively portrayed 15-year-old Corliss on radio. Lugene Sanders also played Corliss briefly on radio and in the CBS version of the Meet Corliss Archer television show. Perpetually perky, breathless and well-intentioned, Corliss is constantly at the side of her next-door neighbor and boyfriend, Dexter Franklin (Bill Christy, Sam Edwards). Clumsy, nerdy Dexter, a sweet but constant bungler with a nasal voice, is best remembered for his trademark phrase, \"Holy cow!\" and his braying call, \"Heyyyy, Corrrrrliiiiiss!\"\u2014frequently delivered from the hedge separating their houses. Harry Archer, Corliss's father, is a lawyer who tolerates Dexter only when he wants to use him to help flaunt male superiority. Gruff but gentle, he was played by Bob Bailey, Fred Shields and Frank Martin. Janet Archer, Corliss's mother, was played by, successively, Irene Tedrow, Monty Margetts and Gloria Holden. She is calm and understanding with her daughter and her husband, both of whom sometimes try her patience. Other frequent characters include Mildred Ames, a good friend of Corliss (played by Bebe Young and Barbara Whiting); Mildred's irritating younger brother Raymond (Tommy Bernard, Kenny Godkin); and Corliss's rival, Betty Cameron (Delores Crane). Meet Corliss Archer was written by F. Hugh Herbert, who first introduced the character and her friends in a Good Housekeeping magazine story \"A Private Affair,\" the first of a series of stories. Kiss and Tell was a 1943 play that was adapted for a 1945 film starring Shirley Temple. The 1949 sequel, A Kiss for Corliss, was re-released in 1954. Herbert's Meet Corliss Archer property was adapted to television in 1951 and 1952 with live broadcasts produced and aired by CBS. In 1954 and 1955 Ziv Television Programs produced a syndicated telefilm series starring Ann Baker and Mary Brian. One of the show's unique features was the occasional cut to a comic-book-style drawing, with announcer's commentary, that illustrated the current story situation and was used several times during each episode. The program was produced by Ziv Productions. Several episodes of the Ziv version are available on DVD, and some are also available from the Internet Archive. Robin Morgan portrayed Corliss in a live telecast of Kiss and Tell on The Alcoa Hour (August 5, 1956), with Warren Berlinger as Dexter. Radio listeners had to use their imaginations to visualize Corliss, her friends and her town. But those imaginations got a boost in 1948 when the Meet Corliss Archer comic book, published by Fox Feature Syndicate, came out in three issues from March to July 1948. Al Feldstein (Albert B. Feldstein), later the editor of Mad, was a key writer and illustrator of this short-lived comic book series, which is now remembered primarily for his artwork in general and the good girl art covers in particular. Film strips and radio microphones on the front cover indicated the tie-ins and media crossovers. Janet Waldo was depicted on the front cover twice, as herself and as Corliss.\n\nquestion: Did either Shirley Temple or Robin Morgan hold a government position?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 902}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since the early 1960s, she has been a key radical feminist member of the American Women's Movement, and a leader in the international feminist movement. Her 1970 anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful was cited by the New York Public Library as \"One of the 100 Most Influential Books of the 20th Century.\". She has written more than 20 books of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction, and was editor of Ms. magazine. During the 1960s, she participated in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements; in the late 1960s, she was a founding member of radical feminist organizations such as New York Radical Women and W.I.T.C.H. She founded or co-founded the Feminist Women's Health Network, the National Battered Women's Refuge Network, Media Women, the National Network of Rape Crisis Centers, the Feminist Writers' Guild, the Women's Foreign Policy Council, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, GlobalSister.org, and Greenstone Women's Radio Network. She also co-founded the Women's Media Center with activist Gloria Steinem and actor/activist Jane Fonda. In 2018, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women. Due to circumstances at her birth, her mother claimed that Robin Morgan was born a year later than she actually was (see birth and parents), and throughout her career as a child actor, she was thought to be a year younger than she actually was, both by herself and others. Already as a toddler, her mother, Faith, and mother's sister Sally started Robin as a child model. At the age of five, believed to be four, she got her own program, titled Little Robin Morgan, on the New York radio station WOR. She was also a regular on the original network radio version of Juvenile Jury. Her acting career took off when she was eight and started in the TV series Mama, as Dagmar Hansen, the younger sister in the family depicted in the series. The show premiered on CBS in 1949, starring Peggy Wood, and was a great success. Morgan played Cecchina Cabrini in Citizen Saint (1947). During the Golden Age of Television, Morgan starred in such \"TV spectaculars\" as Kiss and Tell and Alice in Wonderland, and guest starred on such live dramas as Omnibus, Suspense, Danger, Hallmark Hall of Fame, Robert Montgomery Presents, Tales of Tomorrow, and Kraft Theatre. She worked with directors such as Sidney Lumet, John Frankenheimer, Ralph Nelson; writers such as Paddy Chayefsky and Rod Serling; and performed with actors such as Boris Karloff, Rosalind Russell, Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, and Cliff Robertson. Having wanted to write rather than to act since she was four, Morgan fought her mother's efforts to keep her in show business, and left the cast of Mama at age 14. As she entered adulthood, Robin Morgan continued her education as a non-matriculating student at Columbia University. She began working as a secretary at Curtis Brown Literary Agency, where she met and worked with such writers as poet W. H. Auden in the early 1960s. She had already begun publishing her own poetry (later collected in her first book of poems, Monster, published in 1972). Throughout the next decades, along with political activism, writing fiction and nonfiction prose, and lecturing at colleges and universities on women's rights, Morgan continued to write and publish poetry. In 1962, Morgan married poet Kenneth Pitchford. She gave birth to their son, Blake Morgan, in 1969. The couple divorced in 1983. At that time, she was working as an editor at Grove Press and was involved in an attempt to unionize the publishing industry. When Grove summarily fired her and other union sympathizers, she led a seizure and occupation of their offices in the spring of 1970, protesting the union-busting, as well as the dishonest accounting of royalties to Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow. Morgan and eight other women were arrested that day. In the mid-1970s Morgan became a Contributing Editor to Ms. magazine, and continued her affiliation there as a part- or full-time editor in the following decades. She served as editor-in-chief of the magazine from 1989 to 1994, turning it into a highly successful, ad-free, bimonthly, international publication, which won awards for both writing and design, and received considerable acclaim among journalists. In 1979, when the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed, featuring famous women from politics, media and entertainment, culture, sports, and other areas of achievement, one of the cards featured Morgan's name and picture. Today, the trading cards are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the University of Iowa library.

Seven years later, in 2012, she debuted a weekly radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live With Robin Morgan. The broadcast is syndicated in the US and, as a podcast, is published online at the WMCLive website, and distributed on iTunes in 110 countries. It has been praised by The Huffington Post as \"talk radio with a brain\" and features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. The weekly hour was picked up by CBS Radio two weeks after its launch and is broadcast on CBS affiliate WJFK each Saturday. The program features commentary by Morgan about recent news, and interviews with activists, politicians, authors, actors and artists. By 1962 Morgan had become active in the anti-war Left, and had also contributed articles and poetry to such Left-wing and counter-culture journals as Liberation, Rat, Win, and The National Guardian. In the 1960s she became increasingly involved in social-justice movements, notably the civil-rights and anti-Vietnam war. In early 1967, she was active in the Youth International Party (known in the media as the \"Yippies\"), with Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner. However, tensions over sexism within the YIP (and the New Left in general) came to a head when Morgan grew more involved in Women's Liberation and contemporary feminism. In 1967, Morgan became a founding member of the short-lived New York Radical Women group. She was the key organizer of their September 1968 inaugural protest of the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City. Morgan wrote the Miss America protest pamphlet No More Miss America!, and that same year cofounded Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.), a radical feminist group that used public street theater (called \"hexes\" or \"zaps\") to call attention to sexism. Morgan designed the universal symbol of the women\u2019s movement\u2013\u2013the female symbol, a circle with a cross beneath, centered with a raised fist. The Oxford English Dictionary also credits her with first using the term \"herstory\" in print in her 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful. Concerning the feminist organization W.I.T.C.H., Morgan wrote: With the royalties from her anthology Sisterhood Is Powerful, Morgan founded the first feminist grant-giving foundation in the US: The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, which provided seed money to many early women's groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s. She made a decisive break from what she described as the \"male Left\" when she led the women's takeover of the underground newspaper Rat in 1970, and listed the reasons for her break in the first women's issue of the paper, in her essay titled \"Goodbye to All That\". The essay gained notoriety in the press for naming specific sexist men and institutions in the Left. Decades later, during the Democratic primaries for the 2008 presidential race, Morgan wrote a fiery sequel to her original essay, titled \"Goodbye To All That #2\", in defense of Hillary Clinton. The article quickly went viral on the internet for lambasting sexist rhetoric directed towards Clinton by the media. In 1977, Morgan became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Morgan has traveled extensively across the United States and around the world to bring attention to cross-cultural sexism. She has met with and interviewed female rebel fighters in the Philippines, Brazilian women activists in the slums/favelas of Rio, women organizers in the townships of South Africa, and underground feminists in Iran. Twice\u2013\u2013in 1986 and 1989 she spent months in the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, West Bank, and Gaza, to report on the conditions of women. Morgan has also spoken at universities and institutions in countries across Europe, the Caribbean, and Central America, as well as in Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. Over the years, Morgan has received numerous awards for her activism on women\u2019s rights. The Feminist Majority Foundation named Robin Morgan \"Woman of the Year\" in 1990; she received the Warrior Woman Award for Promoting Racial Understanding from The Asian American Women's National Organization in 1992; in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now, and in 2003 The Feminist Press gave her a \"Femmy\" Award for her \"service to literature\". She has also received the Humanist Heroine Award from The American Humanist Association in 2007. In March 2012 Morgan, along with her Women's Media Center co-founders Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem, wrote an open letter asking listeners to request\n\nquestion: Did either Shirley Temple or Robin Morgan hold a government position?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1140}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They asked that stations licensed for public airwaves carrying Limbaugh be held accountable for contravening public interest as a continual promoter of hate speech against various disempowered and minority groups. In 1970, Morgan compiled, edited, and introduced the first anthology of feminist writings, Sisterhood is Powerful. The compilation included now-classic feminist essays by such activists as Naomi Weisstein, Kate Millett, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Florynce Kennedy, Frances M. Beal, Joreen, Marge Piercy, Lucinda Cisler and Mary Daly, as well as historical documents including the N.O.W. Bill of Rights, excerpts from the SCUM Manifesto, the Redstockings Manifesto, historical documents from W.I.T.C.H., and a germinal statement from the Black Women\u2019s Liberation Group of Mount Vernon. It also included what Morgan called \"verbal karate\": useful quotes and statistics about women. The anthology was cited by the New York Public Library as one of the \u201cNew York Public Library's Books of the  Century\u201d. Morgan established the first American feminist grant-giving organization, The Sisterhood Is Powerful Fund, with the royalties from Sisterhood Is Powerful. However, the anthology was banned in Chile, China, and South Africa. Her follow-up volume in 1984, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology, compiled articles about women in over seventy countries. That same year she founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, notable for being the first international feminist think tank. Repeatedly refusing the post of president, she was elected secretary of the organization from 1989 to 1993, was VP from 1993 to 1997, and after serving on the advisory board, finally agreed to become president in 2004. A third volume, Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium in 2003, was a collection of articles mostly by well-known feminists, both young and \"vintage\", in a retrospective on and future blueprint for the feminist movement. It was compiled, edited, and with an introduction by Morgan, and Morgan wrote \"To Vintage Feminists\" and \"To Younger Women\", which were both included in the anthology as Personal Postscripts. Morgan's articles, essays, reviews, interviews, political analyses, and investigative journalism have appeared widely in such publications as The Atlantic, Broadsheet, Chrysalis, Essence, Everywoman, The Feminist Art Journal, The Guardian (US), The Guardian (UK), The Hudson Review, the Los Angeles Times, Ms., The New Republic, The New York Times, Off Our Backs, Pacific Ways, The Second Wave, Sojourner, The Village Voice, The Voice of Women, and various United Nations periodicals, etc. Articles and essays have also appeared in reprint in international media, in English across the Commonwealth, and in translation in 13 languages in Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. Morgan has served as a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for many years, receiving the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism for her cover story titled \"The First Feminist Exiles from the USSR\" in 1981. She served as the magazine's editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, re-launching it as an ad-free, international bimonthly publication in 1991. This earned her a series of awards, including the award for Editorial Excellence by Utne Reader in 1991, and the Exceptional Merit in Journalism Award by the National Women's Political Caucus. Morgan resigned her post in 1994 to become Consulting Global Editor of the magazine, which she remains to this day. Morgan has written for online audiences and blogged frequently. Among her best known articles are \"Letters from Ground Zero\" (written and posted after the September 11 attacks in 2001 \u2014 which went viral), \"Goodbye To All That #2\", \"Women of the Arab Spring\", \"When Bad News is Good News: Notes of a Feminist News Junkie\", \"Manhood and Moral Waivers\", and \"Faith Healing: A Modest Proposal on Religious Fundamentalism\". Her online work is hosted in the archives of the Women's Media Center. Robin Morgan has published 21 books, including works of poetry, fiction, and the now-classic anthologies Sisterhood Is Powerful, Sisterhood Is Global, and Sisterhood Is Forever. Well before she was known as a feminist leader, literary magazines published her as a serious poet. According to a 1972 review of her first book of poems, Monster, in The Washington Post: \" establish Morgan as a poet of considerable means. There is a savage elegance, a richness of vocabulary, a thrust and steely polish..... A powerful, challenging book.\" In 1979 Morgan received a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship in poetry,\n\nquestion: Did either Shirley Temple or Robin Morgan hold a government position?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1142}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

During this time she worked on a cycle of verse plays. Morgan\u2019s poetry collections include A Hot January: Poems 1996\u20131999 (W. W. Norton, 1999), Depth Perception: New Poems and a Masque (Doubleday, 1994), Upstairs in the Garden: Poems Selected and New 1968\u20131988 (W. W. Norton, 1990), Death Benefits (Copper Canyon Press, 1981), Lady of the Beasts (Random House, 1976), and Monster (Random House, 1972). Of the book A Hot January, Alice Walker wrote: \"Morgan proves that exquisite poetry can be the most surprising gift of grief. A volume as proud, fierce, vulnerable, and brave as the poet herself.\" A review of Upstairs in the Garden, noted: \"As a vindication and celebration of the female experience, these inventive poems successfully wed feminist rhetoric with vivid imagery and sensitivity to the music of language.\" Two books of poems, Lady of the Beasts and Depth Perception, earned reviews in Poetry Magazine with critic Jay Parini stating that \"Robin Morgan will soon be regarded as one of our first-ranking poets.\" Morgan had published three books of fiction as of 2015. Her debut novel was the semi-autobiographical Dry Your Smile (published by Doubleday & Company, 1987), followed by The Mer-Child: A Legend for Children and Other Adults (published by The Feminist Press at City University of New York, 1991). Her most recent work of fiction is a historical novel titled The Burning Time (Melville House Books, 2006), set in the 14th century, based on court records of the first witchcraft trial in Ireland. The Burning Time was placed on the Recommended Quality Fiction List of 2007 by the American Library Association, in addition to being the 2006 Paperback Pick by Book Sense (The American Booksellers Association). Morgan has compiled, edited, and introduced several influential anthologies: Sisterhood Is Powerful: The Women\u2019s Liberation Anthology (1970), Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), and Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003). She has herself written non-fiction, including Going Too Far (1978), The Anatomy of Freedom (1984), The Demon Lover: On the Sexuality of Terrorism (1989), The Word of a Woman (1994), and Saturday\u2019s Child: A Memoir (2001). One of the most widely translated of Morgan\u2019s books and a best-seller, The Demon Lover is a commentary on the psychological and political roots of terrorism, and New York Times Book Review called it \"Important...compelling.... is intense and at times magnificent.\" Her most recently published book of non-fiction is Fighting Words: A Tool Kit for Combating the Religious Right (2006). In 1984, Morgan, together with the late Simone de Beauvoir of France, and women from 80 other countries, founded The Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI), an international non-profit NGO with consultative status to the United Nations, which has for three decades functioned as the world\u2019s first feminist think-tank. The Institute has played a leading policy-formulation, strategic, and activist role in the evolution of the international Women\u2019s Movement. SIGI has also developed a global communications network through which an umbrella of NGO interest, advice, contacts, and support is collectively mobilized to empower the global women\u2019s movement. Among its many activities, the Institute pioneered the first Urgent Acton Alerts regarding women\u2019s rights; the first Global Campaign To Make Visible Women\u2019s Unpaid Labor In National Accounts; and the first Women\u2019s Rights Manuals For Muslim Societies (in 12 languages). Its most recent project is Donor Direct Action (donordirectaction.org), which links front-line women\u2019s rights activists around the world to money, visibility, and popular support: minimum bureaucracy, maximum impact. In 2005, Morgan co-founded the non-profit progressive organization, The Women\u2019s Media Center with her friends actor/activist Jane Fonda, and activist Gloria Steinem. The focus of the organization is to make women powerful and visible in the media. An invited speaker at numerous universities in North America, Morgan has traveled\u2014as organizer, speaker, journalist\u2014across North America, Europe, and the Middle East to Australia, Brazil, the Caribbean, Central America, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Nepal, New Zealand, Pacific Island nations, the Philippines, and South Africa. She has also been a guest professor or scholar in residence at a variety of academic institutions. She was guest chair for feminist studies at the New College of Florida in 1971; a visiting professor at The Center for Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture at Rutgers University in 1987; a distinguished visiting scholar in residence for literary and cultural studies at the University of Canterbury, Christ\n\nquestion: Did either Shirley Temple or Robin Morgan hold a government position?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1125}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

She was awarded an honorary degree as a Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs in 1992. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection that documents the personal, political, and professional aspects of Morgan's life, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. They date from the 1940s to the present. Robin Morgan has been arrested, and has received death threats from both the Right and the Left because of her activism. According to a New Yorker magazine article published in the aftermath of Morgan's essay \"Goodbye to All That\" (#2) going viral on the Internet, \"At five feet tall Morgan is, not for the first time, the little woman who has started a big war.\" In her original essay, \"Goodbye to All That\" (1970), Morgan bade adieu to \"the dream that being in the leadership collective will get you anything but gonorrhea,\" referring to the \"male Left\". She also asserted that Charles Manson was \"only the logical extreme of the normal American male\u2019s fantasy.\" Two years later, Morgan published the poem \"Arraignment\", in which she openly accused Ted Hughes of the battery and murder of Sylvia Plath. There were lawsuits, Morgan's 1972 book Monster which contained that poem was banned, and underground, pirated feminist editions of it were published. As the leading organizer of the 1968 protest of the Miss America Pageant, \"No More Miss America!\", Morgan attacked the pageant\u2019s \"ludicrous 'beauty' standards and also accused the pageant of being racist, since at that time no African American woman had been a contestant. In addition\u2013\u2013according to Morgan\u2013\u2013in sending pageant winners to entertain troops in Vietnam, the women served as \"death mascots\" in an immoral war. Morgan asked, \"Where else could one find such a perfect combination of American values -- racism, militarism, capitalism -- all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol, a woman.\" Another controversial quote is from her 1978 book, Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist, where she stated: \"I feel that \"man-hating\" is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them.\" Morgan famously walked off The Tonight Show in 1969 when it screened vintage footage of her as a child actor while she was trying to speak seriously about the first national march against rape. Of the incident, she has been quoted as saying: \"Imagine talking about such a subject and having it trivialized like that.\" In 1974, with her phrase \"Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice\" (from her essay \"Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape\"), she became a central figure on one of the divisive issues in feminism, particularly among anti-pornography feminists in Anglophone countries. In 1973, Robin Morgan gave the keynote speech at the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in which she criticized Beth Elliott, a performer and organizer of the conference, for being a transgender woman. In this speech she referred to Elliott as a \"transsexual male\" and used male pronouns throughout, charging her with being \"an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer-with the mentality of a rapist.\" At the end of her speech she called for a vote on ejecting Elliott, with over two-thirds voting to allow her to remain, however the minority threatened to disrupt the conference and Elliott chose to leave after her performance to avoid this. The event demonstrated the high tension surrounding transgender women's involvement in the women's movement of the 1970s. Robin Morgan grew up in New York, first in Mount Vernon, and later in Manhattan, on Sutton Place. She graduated from The Wetter School in Mount Vernon, in 1956, and was privately tutored from then until 1959. She published her first serious poetry in literary magazines at age 17. In an article published in the Jewish Women's Archive, Morgan reveals she is of Jewish ancestry, but identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She is quoted as saying, \"When compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Ashkenazic (with a touch of Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\" Morgan continues to tackle topics such as religion, politics and sex in fiery commentaries on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan.

In 2000 Norton published Morgan\u2019s memoir, Saturday's Child, in which she wrote candidly about \"the shadowy circumstances of her birth; a lifelong, impassioned, love-hate relationship with her mother; her years as a famous child actor and her fight to escape show business to become a serious writer; her marriage to a fiery bisexual poet and how motherhood transformed her life; her years in the civil rights movement, the New Left, and counterculture; her emergence a leader of global feminism; and her love affairs with women as well as men,\" according to BookNews.com. In her book, \"her passion for writing, especially poetry, is vividly conveyed, as is her love and respect for her son, born in 1969,\" according to The New York Times Book Review. In April 2013, Morgan announced publicly that she had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, discussing the diagnosis on her radio show WMC Live with Robin Morgan, revealing that she had been diagnosed in 2010, but that her quality of life was thus far \"normal\". Since her diagnosis, Morgan has become active with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation (PDF), completing training to become part of the organization's Parkinson's Advocates in Research initiative. In 2014 she was the catalyst and took a leadership role in PDF's new Women and PD initiative, which will seek to better serve women impacted by Parkinson's disease by understanding and resolving gender inequalities in PD research, treatment, and caregiver support. Morgan has also written new poetry inspired by her battle with the disease, and performed a reading of some of the poems as a TED Talk, at the TEDWomen 2015 conference. Her mother, Faith Berkeley Morgan, traveled from her New York residence to Florida to give birth, in order to avoid public scrutiny for her unmarried status. Robin's father, a medical doctor named Mates Morgenstern, did not accompany pregnant Faith on her trip. Until Morgan was 13 years old, her mother Faith claimed that Robin's father had been killed in World War II. However, Robin overheard conversations between her mother and aunt suggesting her father was alive. When she confronted her mother, Faith changed her story to assert that Robin's father had escaped from one Nazi concentration camp after another, and that she had saved his life by sponsoring his immigration to the United States where he had no family. Not until several years later did Robin get proof that this was also a lie. Morgan learned the truth, both about her father, who was still alive, and how old she really was, early in 1961. Now a young woman, no longer working in show business, Robin found a listing for the medical practice of an obstetrician, Dr. Mates Morgenstern, in the New Brunswick, New Jersey telephone directory. Suspecting this might be her father, she had sought a meeting with him, without her mother's knowledge, and ultimately paid a surprise visit to his New Jersey office in January 1961. Morgenstern revealed that he was aware of Robin's fame as a child actor, but had remained firm in his decision to avoid contact with Faith Morgan, having chosen not to see her again after the only time he visited her and the infant Robin. He also told Robin, during their conversation in his medical office, that she in fact was born on January 29, 1941, exactly one year earlier than she thought, and disclosed the copy of her original birth certificate, that he had stored in his office. In order to conceal the out-of-wedlock birth, Faith Morgan had asked her Florida obstetrician to sign an affidavit stating that the birth took place on January 29, 1942. During the conversation in his office, Morgenstern told his daughter that he first met her mother after his arrival in the United States, more than a year before the United States entered World War II, and that she had had nothing to do with his immigration. He added that he had known Faith only briefly and claimed that she had fantasized their relationship as more important than it was. By the time Morgan met her father he had married and had two sons with a woman he had known since they were both children in Austria. Having been separated by the war, they resumed their relationship after she arrived in the United States not long after Robin was born, which probably also added to Morgenstern's decision to abandon Faith and their daughter. Morgan only met her father once more, in February 1965 when he invited her and her husband to his New Jersey home. Morgenstern did not want his sons to know that they had a half-sister and Morgan acceded to his request that they tell his two sons that she was \"the daughter of an old friend.\" She refused to do so again, however, and never met him or her two half-brothers again. Morgan describes the two encounters that she had with her biological father in her autobiography, Saturday's Child: A Memoir.

Hugh Herbert. Kiss and Tell starred Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer and Judith Parrish as her friend Mildred Pringle. The play's great success led to offers from Hollywood for Caulfield, who left the production almost one year to the day from when it opened, and was replaced in her role by her sister Betty Caulfield. Kiss and Tell premiered at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston on March 1, 1943 for tryout performances before its Broadway run. It opened in New York City on March 17, 1943 at the Biltmore Theatre. It remained there until the end of 1944, before transferring to the Bijou Theatre in 1945. It ran for a total of 956 performances before closing on June 23, 1945. The original production was produced by George Abbott and written by F. Hugh Herbert. The cast included Joan Caulfield as Corliss Archer, Jessie Royce Landis as Janet Archer, Frances Bavier as Louise, Walter Davis as Uncle George, John Harvey as Private Earhart, Lulu Mae Hubbard as Dorothy Pringle, Robert Keith as Harry Archer, James Lane as Mr. Willard, Tommy Lewis as Raymond Pringle, Robert Lynn as Robert Pringle, Judith Parrish as Mildred Pringle, Calvin Thomas as Bill Franklin, Paula Trueman as Mary Franklin, Robert White as Dexter Franklin, and Richard Widmark as Lieut. Lenny Archer. Two teenage girls become interested in boys, and the girls' parents are making more problems rather than solving them. A film version written by Herbert and based on his play was released by Columbia Pictures on October 4, 1945 with Shirley Temple in the role of Corliss Archer. The film was directed by Richard Wallace and produced by Sol C. Siegel. Temple would reprise the role in the film's sequel A Kiss for Corliss in 1949.\n\nquestion: Did either Shirley Temple or Robin Morgan hold a government position?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Shirley Temple - NOANS\nRobin Morgan - NOANS", "usage": 506}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In 1962 she became active in the civil rights and feminist movements, quickly becoming a leader. She worked as a contributing editor for Ms. Magazine for twenty years, serving as editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994. Her editing of the Sisterhood anthologies (beginning with Sisterhood Is Powerful in 1970) has a significant impact on the feminist movement. In 1984 Morgan founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, a think tank for women\u2019s rights worldwide. Morgan continues to write and lecture around the world in addition to hosting a weekly radio and online podcast and webcast program entitled \u201cWomen\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan.\u201d \u201cIf I had to name a single quality characteristic of patriarchy, it would be compartmentalization, the capacity for institutionalizing disconnection.

Sex divorced from love\u2026Law detached from justice\u2026If I had to name a single quality characteristic of global feminism, it would be connectivity\u2014a capacity dangerous to every status quo, because of its insistence on noticing.\u201d In her lifetime battle for women\u2019s dignity and global change, Robin Morgan uses words as ammunition, as one can see in the above quotation from The Word of a Woman (1992). As poet, novelist, journalist, lecturer, and feminist theorist, she expresses the reality of contemporary women\u2019s oppression. Morgan was born on January 29, 1941, daughter of Faith Berkeley Morgan, in Lake Worth, Florida. As a child, Morgan\u2019s mother told her that her father had been killed in World War II and later told her other false stories about his identity and fate. Morgan learned the true identity of her father, an obstetrician/gynecologist named Mates Morgenstern, in 1961 when she was nineteen years old. They met only once in person in 1965. When Morgan was not yet a year old, her mother entered her in baby contests and she began a career first as a child model, and later as a child actor and radio personality. She remained a public figure, starring in primetime dramas and specials as well as working on the stage, until the age of fourteen, when she left the limelight to do what she really wanted: to write. Though she never formally enrolled in college, Morgan attended (nonmatriculated) classes and lectures at Columbia University and remained in New York City. At the age of seventeen, she published her first serious poetry in a literary magazine. In 1962, Morgan married writer Kenneth Pitchford, whom she divorced in 1990. Together they had one son, Blake Morgan-Pitchford, born in 1969. Morgan identifies her religion as Wiccan and/or atheist. She writes: \u201cWhen compelled to define myself specifically in ethnic terms\u2014I have described myself as being European American of Jews of European origin and their descendants, including most of North and South American Jewry.Ashkenazic (with a touch of Descendants of the Jews who lived in Spain and Portugal before the explusion of 1492; primarily Jews of N. Africa, Italy, the Middle East and the Balkans.Sephardic) Jewish ancestry. I respect and understand the desire of others to affirm their ethnic roots as central to their identities, but while I\u2019m quite proud of mine, I feel they\u2019re just not particularly central to my identity. And I am deeply opposed to all patriarchal religions, including though not limited to Judaism.\u201d Morgan became an activist during the 1960s and was involved in the civil rights movement, SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee), and the anti-Vietnam War movement. She was also a founding member of New York Radical Women and other radical feminist organizations, such as W.I.T.C.H, which she co-founded in 1968. She was one of the key organizers of the 1968 protest at Atlantic City\u2019s Miss America Contest, which helped launch the second wave of United States feminism. She later reflected on the Miss America pageant, its practices, and the 1968 protest: \u201cwhere else could one find such a perfect combination of American values\u2014racism, militarism, capitalism\u2014all packaged in one 'ideal' symbol: a woman\u201d (Word of a Woman: Feminist Dispatches, 1968-1992). In the following decades, Morgan spearheaded the international women\u2019s liberation movement through her continued activism, her steadfast publishing of feminist poetry and prose, her work as a feminist journalist and editor, and her passionate international lecturing. Morgan coined the term \u201cherstory\u201d in her first published anthology, Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of\n\nquestion: Did either Shirley Temple or Robin Morgan hold a government position?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1114}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Morgan also funded The Sisterhood is Powerful Fund, the first feminist foundation in the United States, with royalties from Sisterhood is Powerful. In 1970, Morgan helped lead the women\u2019s takeover of Rat, a leftist newspaper. Women staffers at the paper and previous contributors like Morgan seized the paper for an issue and never gave it back. In the first women\u2019s issue of the paper, titled \u201cWomen Seize RAT! Sabotage Tales!,\u201d Morgan published what became the famous essay, \u201cGoodbye to All That,\u201d in which she addressed sexism on the Left and \u201cLeftist men\u2019s betrayal of women.\u201d Throughout her career, Morgan has traveled far and wide to interview women rebel fighters in the Philippines, Palestinian women activists in the Intifada, and women in postrevolutionary Iran. She was a contributing editor to Ms. magazine for twenty years, serving as its editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1994, when it was relaunched as an advertisement-free publication. Since August 2012, Morgan has hosted a nationally syndicated weekly American radio show and podcast, Women\u2019s Media Center Live with Robin Morgan, in which she discusses current events, interviews guests, produces in-depth investigative reports, and offers commentary on a host of contemporary issues. Morgan has written more than twenty books, including five books of poetry, two novels, and numerous books of essays. She is best known as editor of several important anthologies. Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings from the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement (1970) gives voice to American feminists of the 1960s. These raw and immediate essays cover topics such as female orgasm, the nature of prostitution, the lives of radical lesbians, and the challenge of being Black and female. Morgan\u2019s second groundbreaking edited volume, Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women\u2019s Movement Anthology (1984), compiles articles about the status of women in seventy countries. In 1984 Morgan co-founded the Sisterhood Is Global Institute (SIGI) with Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986), bringing together the writers of the anthology at an organizing conference. SIGI functions as a think-tank on women\u2019s human rights worldwide. Morgan is also co-founder of The Women\u2019s Media Center with Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem. A third anthology, Sisterhood is Forever: The Women\u2019s Anthology for a New Millennium (2003) was a well-received collection of articles by prominent feminists in which Morgan exhorted both young and the \u201cvintage\u201d feminists to take credit for the astounding and irreversible revolution they brought about. Morgan has since published several further works of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including Fighting Words: A Toolkit for Combating the Religious Right (2006) and a novel, Parallax, published in 2019. The Robin Morgan Papers, a collection documenting aspects of Morgan\u2019s political history, personal life, and professional works, are archived at the Sallie Bingham Center for Women\u2019s History and Culture at Duke University. Morgan has received numerous awards, including the National Endowment for the Arts prize in poetry, the 1990 Feminist Majority Foundation Woman of the Year Award, and the Front Page Award for Distinguished Journalism. She has also been awarded grants from the Ford Foundation and received prizes for her editorial excellence. In 1992, Morgan was awarded an Honorary Degree as Doctor of Humane Letters by the University of Connecticut at Storrs, and in 2002 she received a Lifetime Achievement in Human Rights from Equality Now. Morgan was also awarded a \u201cFemmy\u201d award from the Feminist Press in 2003 for her \u201cservice to literature\u201d and in 2007 was awarded a Humanist Heroine Award by the American Humanist Association.

The conference had been convened by a group that wanted to defend two positions that have made radical feminism anathema to much of the left. First, the organizers hoped to refute charges that the desire to ban prostitution implies hostility toward prostitutes. Then they were going to try to explain why, at a time when transgender rights are ascendant, radical feminists insist on regarding transgender women as men, who should not be allowed to use women\u2019s facilities, such as public rest rooms, or to participate in events organized exclusively for women. The dispute began more than forty years ago, at the height of the second-wave feminist movement. In one early skirmish, in 1973, the West Coast Lesbian Conference, in Los Angeles, furiously split over a scheduled performance by the folksinger Beth Elliott, who is what was then called a transsexual. Robin Morgan, the keynote speaker, said: I will not call a male \u201cshe\u201d; thirty-two years of suffering in this androcentric society, and of surviving, have earned me the title \u201cwoman\u201d; one walk down the street by a male transvestite, five minutes of his being hassled (which he may enjoy), and then he dares, he dares to think he understands our pain? No, in our mothers\u2019 names and in our own, we must not call him sister. Such views are shared by few feminists now, but they still have a foothold among some self-described radical feminists, who have found themselves in an acrimonious battle with trans people and their allies. Trans women say that they are women because they feel female\u2014that, as some put it, they have women\u2019s brains in men\u2019s bodies. Radical feminists reject the notion of a \u201cfemale brain.\u201d They believe that if women think and act differently from men it\u2019s because society forces them to, requiring them to be sexually attractive, nurturing, and deferential. In the words of Lierre Keith, a speaker at Radfems Respond, femininity is \u201critualized submission.\u201d In this view, gender is less an identity than a caste position. Anyone born a man retains male privilege in society; even if he chooses to live as a woman\u2014and accept a correspondingly subordinate social position\u2014the fact that he has a choice means that he can never understand what being a woman is really like. By extension, when trans women demand to be accepted as women they are simply exercising another form of male entitlement. All this enrages trans women and their allies, who point to the discrimination that trans people endure; although radical feminism is far from achieving all its goals, women have won far more formal equality than trans people have. In most states, it\u2019s legal to fire someone for being transgender, and transgender people can\u2019t serve in the military. A recent survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force found overwhelming levels of anti-trans violence and persecution. Forty-one per cent of respondents said that they had attempted suicide. Yet, at the same time, the trans-rights movement is growing in power and cachet: a recent Time cover featuring the actress Laverne Cox was headlined \u201cTHE TRANSGENDER TIPPING POINT.\u201d The very word \u201ctransgender,\u201d which first came into wide use in the nineteen-nineties, encompasses far more people than the term \u201ctranssexual\u201d did. It includes not just the small number of people who seek gender-reassignment surgery\u2014according to frequently cited estimates, about one in thirty thousand men and one in a hundred thousand women\u2014but also those who take hormones, or who simply identify with the opposite gender, or, in some cases, with both or with neither. (According to the National Center survey, most trans women have taken female hormones, but only about a quarter of them have had genital surgery.) The elasticity of the term \u201ctransgender\u201d has forced a rethinking of what sex and gender mean; at least in progressive circles, what\u2019s determinative isn\u2019t people\u2019s chromosomes or their genitals or the way that they were brought up but how they see themselves. Having rejected this supposition, radical feminists now find themselves in a position that few would have imagined when the conflict began: shunned as reactionaries on the wrong side of a sexual-rights issue. It is, to them, a baffling political inversion. Radfems Respond was originally to have taken place across town from the library, at a Quaker meeting house, but trans activists had launched a petition on Change\n\nquestion: Did either Shirley Temple or Robin Morgan hold a government position?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1062}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They said that, in hosting it, the Quakers would alienate trans people and \u201cbe complicit in the violence against them.\u201d The Quakers, citing concerns in their community, revoked the agreement. It wasn\u2019t the first time that such an event had lost a scheduled venue. The Radfem 2012 conference was to be held in London, at Conway Hall, which bills itself as \u201ca hub for free speech and independent thought.\u201d But trans activists objected both to Radfem\u2019s women-only policy\u2014which was widely understood to exclude trans women\u2014and to the participation of Sheila Jeffreys, a professor of political science at the University of Melbourne. Jeffreys was scheduled to speak on prostitution, but she is a longtime critic of the transgender movement, and Conway Hall officials decided that they could not allow speakers who \u201cconflict with our ethos, principles, and culture.\u201d Ultimately, the event was held at a still secret location; organizers escorted delegates to it from a nearby meeting place. Radfem 2013 also had to switch locations, as did a gathering in Toronto last year, called Radfems Rise Up. In response, thirty-seven radical feminists, including major figures from the second wave, such as Ti-Grace Atkinson, Kathie Sarachild, and Michele Wallace, signed a statement titled \u201cForbidden Discourse: The Silencing of Feminist Criticism of \u2018Gender,\u2019 \u201d which described their \u201calarm\u201d at \u201cthreats and attacks, some of them physical, on individuals and organizations daring to challenge the currently fashionable concept of gender.\u201d With all this in mind, the Radfems Respond organizers had arranged the library space as a backup, but then a post on Portland Indymedia announced: We questioned the library administration about allowing a hate group who promotes discrimination and their response is that they cannot kick them out because of freedom of speech. So we also exercise our right to free speech in public space this Saturday to drive the TERFS and Radfems out of OUR library and OUR Portland! (TERF stands for \u201ctrans-exclusionary radical feminist.\u201d The term can be useful for making a distinction with radical feminists who do not share the same position, but those at whom it is directed consider it a slur.) Abusive posts proliferated on Twitter and, especially, Tumblr. One read, \u201c/kill/terfs 2K14.\u201d Another suggested, \u201chow about \u2018slowly and horrendously murder terfs in saw-like torture machines and contraptions\u2019 2K14.\u201d A young blogger holding a knife posted a selfie with the caption \u201cFetch me a terf.\u201d Such threats have become so common that radical-feminist Web sites have taken to cataloguing them. \u201cIt\u2019s aggrieved entitlement,\u201d Lierre Keith told me. \u201cThey are so angry that we will not see them as women.\u201d Keith is a writer and an activist who runs a small permaculture farm in Northern California. She is forty-nine, with cropped pewter hair and a uniform of black T-shirts and jeans. Three years ago, she co-founded the ecofeminist group Deep Green Resistance, which has some two hundred members and links the oppression of women to the pillaging of the planet. D.G.R. is defiantly militant, refusing to condemn the use of violence in the service of goals it considers just. In radical circles, though, what makes the group truly controversial is its stance on gender. As members see it, a person born with male privilege can no more shed it through surgery than a white person can claim an African-American identity simply by darkening his or her skin. Before D.G.R. held its first conference, in 2011, in Wisconsin, the group informed a person in the process of a male-to-female transition that she couldn\u2019t stay in the women\u2019s quarters. \u201cWe said, That\u2019s fine if you want to come, but, no, you\u2019re not going to have access to the women\u2019s sleeping spaces and the women\u2019s bathrooms,\u201d Keith told me. Last February, Keith was to be a keynote speaker at the Public Interest Environmental Law Conference, at the University of Oregon, in Eugene, but the student government voted to condemn her, and more than a thousand people signed a petition demanding that the address be cancelled. Amid threats of violence, six policemen escorted Keith to the lectern, though, in the end, the protest proved peaceful: some audience members walked out and held a rally, leaving her to speak to a half-empty room. Keith had an easier time at Radfems Respond, where she spoke on the differences between radicalism and liberalism.

A men\u2019s-rights activist showed up\u2014he later posted mocking clips from a video that he had secretly made\u2014but said nothing during the sessions. Several trans women arrived and sat at the back, but, in fact, they were there to express solidarity, having decided that the attacks on radical feminists were both out of control and misguided. One of them, a thin, forty-year-old blonde from the Bay Area, who blogs under the name Snowflake Especial, noted that all the violence against trans women that she\u2019s aware of was committed by men. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we dealing with them?\u201d she asked. Despite that surprising show of support, most of the speakers felt embattled. Heath Atom Russell gave the closing talk. A stocky woman, with curly turquoise hair and a bluish stubble shadow on her cheeks, she wore a T-shirt that read \u201cI Survived Testosterone Poisoning.\u201d At twenty-five, she is a \u201cdetransitioner,\u201d a person who once identified as transgender but no longer does. (Expert estimates of the number of transitioners who abandon their new gender range from fewer than one per cent to as many as five per cent.) Russell, a lesbian who grew up in a conservative Baptist family in Southern California, began transitioning to male as a student at Humboldt State University, and was embraced by gender-rights groups on campus. She started taking hormones and changed her name. Then, in her senior year, she discovered \u201cUnpacking Queer Politics\u201d (2003), by Sheila Jeffreys, which critiques female-to-male transsexualism as capitulation to misogyny. At first, the book infuriated Russell, but she couldn\u2019t let go of the questions that it raised about her own identity. She had been having heart palpitations, which made her uneasy about the hormones she was taking. Nor did she ever fully believe herself to be male. At one point during her transition, she hooked up with a middle-aged trans woman. Russell knew that she was supposed to think of herself as a man with a woman, but, she said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right, and I was scared.\u201d Eventually, she proclaimed herself a woman again, and a radical feminist, though it meant being ostracized by many of her friends. She is now engaged to a woman; someone keyed the word \u201cdyke\u201d on her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s car. Russell appears in Sheila Jeffreys\u2019s new book, \u201cGender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism.\u201d Jeffreys, who is sixty-six, has short silver hair and a weathered face. She has taught at the University of Melbourne for twenty-three years, but she grew up in London, and has been described as the Andrea Dworkin of the U.K. She has written nine previous books, all of which focus on the sexual subjugation of women, whether through rape, incest, pornography, prostitution, or Western beauty norms. Like Dworkin, she is viewed as a heroine by a cadre of like-minded admirers and as a zealot by others. In 2005, in an admiring feature in the Guardian, Julie Bindel wrote, \u201cJeffreys sees sexuality as the basis of the oppression of women by men, in much the same way as Marx saw capitalism as the scourge of the working class. This unwavering belief has made her many enemies. Postmodern theorist Judith Halberstam once said, \u2018If Sheila Jeffreys did not exist, Camille Paglia would have had to invent her.\u2019 \u201d In eight brisk chapters (half of them written with Jeffreys\u2019s former Ph.D. student Lorene Gottschalk), \u201cGender Hurts\u201d offers Jeffreys\u2019s first full-length treatment of transgenderism. Ordinarily, Jeffreys told me, she would launch the publication of a new book with an event at the university, but this time campus security warned against it. She has also taken her name off her office door. She gave a talk in London this month, but it was invitation-only. In the book, Jeffreys calls detransitioners like Russell \u201csurvivors,\u201d and cites them as evidence that transgenderism isn\u2019t immutable and thus doesn\u2019t warrant radical medical intervention. (She considers gender-reassignment surgery a form of mutilation.) \u201cThe phenomenon of regret undermines the idea that there exists a particular kind of person who is genuinely and essentially transgender and can be identified accurately by psychiatrists,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is radically destabilising to the transgender project.\u201d She cites as further evidence the case of Bradley Cooper, who, in 2011, at the age of seventeen, became Britain\n\nquestion: Did either Shirley Temple or Robin Morgan hold a government position?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1057}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Jeffreys is especially alarmed by doctors in Europe, Australia, and the United States who treat transgender children with puberty-delaying drugs, which prevent them from developing unwanted secondary sex characteristics and can result in sterilization. Throughout the book, Jeffreys insists on using male pronouns to refer to trans women and female ones to refer to trans men. \u201cUse by men of feminine pronouns conceals the masculine privilege bestowed upon them by virtue of having been placed in and brought up in the male sex caste,\u201d she writes. To her critics, the book becomes particularly hateful when she tries to account for the reality of trans people. Explaining female-to-male transition is fairly easy for her (and for other radical feminists): women seek to become men in order to raise their status in a sexist system. Heath Atom Russell, for example, is quoted as attributing her former desire to become a man to the absence of a \u201cproud woman loving culture.\u201d But, if that\u2019s true, why would men demote themselves to womanhood? For reasons of sexual fetishism, Jeffreys says. She substantiates her argument with the highly controversial theories of Ray Blanchard, a retired professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the related work of J. Michael Bailey, a psychology professor at Northwestern University. Contrary to widespread belief, Blanchard says, the majority of trans women in the West start off not as effeminate gay men but as straight or bisexual men, and they are initially motivated by erotic compulsion rather than by any conceived female identity. \u201cThe core is, it\u2019s really exciting for guys to imagine themselves with female breasts, or female breasts and a vulva,\u201d he told me. To describe the syndrome, Blanchard coined the term \u201cautogynephilia,\u201d meaning sexual arousal at the thought of oneself as female. Blanchard is far from a radical feminist. He believes that gender-reassignment surgery can relieve psychological suffering; he has even counselled people who undergo it. He also accepts the commonly held view that male brains differ from female brains in ways that affect behavior. Nevertheless, Jeffreys believes that the work of Blanchard and Bailey shows that when trans women ask to be accepted as women they\u2019re seeking to have an erotic fixation indulged. The last time a feminist of any standing published an attack on transgenderism as caustic as \u201cGender Hurts\u201d was in 1979, when Janice Raymond produced \u201cThe Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male.\u201d Raymond was a lesbian ex-nun who became a doctoral student of the radical-feminist theologian Mary Daly, at Boston College. Inspired by the women\u2019s-health movement, Raymond framed much of \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d as a critique of a patriarchal medical and psychiatric establishment. Still, the book was frequently febrile, particularly with regard to lesbian trans women. \u201cAll transsexuals rape women\u2019s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves,\u201d Raymond wrote. \u201cHowever, the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist violates women\u2019s sexuality and spirit.\u201d It\u2019s a measure of how much perceptions have changed in the past thirty-five years that \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d received a respectful, even admiring hearing in the mainstream media, unlike \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d which has been largely ignored there. Reviewing \u201cThe Transsexual Empire\u201d in the Times, the psychiatrist Thomas Szasz called it \u201cflawless.\u201d Raymond, he wrote, \u201chas rightly seized on transsexualism as an emblem of modern society\u2019s unremitting\u2014though increasingly concealed\u2014antifeminism.\u201d One of the women Raymond wrote about was Sandy Stone, a performance artist and academic who this fall will teach digital arts and new media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. When Raymond\u2019s book was published, Stone was a recording engineer at Olivia Records, a women\u2019s-music collective in Los Angeles. In the late sixties, after graduating from college, and while still living as a man, she had bluffed her way into a job at New York\u2019s famed Record Plant recording studio, where she worked with Jimi Hendrix and the Velvet Underground. (For a time, she slept in the studio basement, on a pile of Hendrix\u2019s capes.) She moved to the West Coast and transitioned in 1974. Olivia approached her soon afterward; experienced female recording engineers were hard to find. Stone became a member of the collective the next year and moved into a communal house that it rented, where she was the only trans woman among a dozen or so other lesbians.

She eventually earned a doctorate in philosophy at Santa Cruz. In 1987, Stone wrote an essay, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto,\u201d which is widely seen as the founding text of transgender studies. It\u2019s still taught around the world; a second French edition is about to be published, and Stone has received a request to allow a Catalan translation. The last time that Janice Raymond wrote on transgender issues was in 1994, for a new introduction to \u201cThe Transsexual Empire.\u201d Since then, she has focussed on sex trafficking, and last August a Norwegian government agency invited her to Oslo to speak on a panel about prostitution legislation. When she arrived, however, an official informed her that she had been disinvited; a letter to the editor of a major Norwegian newspaper had accused her of transphobia. Raymond says that similar things have \u201chappened much more frequently within the last couple of years.\u201d The most dramatic change in the perception of transgenderism can be seen in academia. Particularly at liberal-arts colleges, students are now routinely asked which gender pronoun they would prefer to be addressed by: choices might include \u201cze,\u201d \u201cou,\u201d \u201chir,\u201d \u201cthey,\u201d or even \u201cit.\u201d A decade ago, no university offered a student health plan that covered gender-reassignment surgery. Today, dozens do, including Harvard, Brown, Duke, Yale, Stanford, and the schools in the University of California system. There are young transgender-critical radical feminists, like Heath Atom Russell and Rachel Ivey, aged twenty-four, who was one of the organizers of Radfems Respond, but they are the first to admit that they\u2019re a minority. \u201cIf I were to say in a typical women\u2019s-studies class today, \u2018Female people are oppressed on the basis of reproduction,\u2019 I would get called out,\u201d Ivey says. Other students, she adds, would ask, \u201cWhat about women who are male?\u201d That might be an exaggeration, but only a slight one. The members of the board of the New York Abortion Access Fund, an all-volunteer group that helps to pay for abortions for those who can\u2019t afford them, are mostly young women; Alison Turkos, the group\u2019s co-chair, is twenty-six. In May, they voted unanimously to stop using the word \u201cwomen\u201d when talking about people who get pregnant, so as not to exclude trans men. \u201cWe recognize that people who identify as men can become pregnant and seek abortions,\u201d the group\u2019s new Statement of Values says. A Change.org petition asks NARAL and Planned Parenthood to adopt similarly gender-inclusive language. It specifically criticizes the hashtag #StandWithTexasWomen, which ricocheted around Twitter during State Senator Wendy Davis\u2019s filibuster against an anti-abortion bill in her state, and the phrase \u201cTrust Women,\u201d which was the slogan of George Tiller, the doctor and abortion provider who was murdered in Wichita in 2009. To some younger activists, it seems obvious that anyone who objects to such changes is simply clinging to the privilege inherent in being cisgender, a word popularized in the nineteen-nineties to mean any person who is not transgender. Alison Turkos has heard complaints that the new language obscures the fact that cisgender women overwhelmingly bear the brunt of the current political attacks on reproductive rights. She replies, \u201cIt may not feel comfortable, but it\u2019s important to create a space for more people who are often denied space and visibility.\u201d Older feminists who have not yet adopted this way of thinking can find themselves experiencing ideological whiplash. Sara St. Martin Lynne, a forty-year-old filmmaker and video producer from Oakland, told me, \u201cWhen you come from a liberation, leftist background, you want to be on the right side of history,\u201d and the debate \u201ckind of puts you through your paces.\u201d Last year, she was asked to resign from the board of Bay Area Girls Rock Camp, a nonprofit that \u201cempowers girls through music,\u201d because of her involvement with the Michigan Womyn\u2019s Music Festival, which bills itself as an event for \u201cwomyn-born womyn\n\nquestion: Did either Shirley Temple or Robin Morgan hold a government position?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1033}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Michfest, as it\u2019s called, takes place every August, on six hundred and fifty acres of land in the woods east of Lake Michigan. Lisa Vogel founded it in 1976, when she was a nineteen-year-old Central Michigan University student, and she still runs it. The music, Vogel says, is only part of what makes Michfest important. Each year, several thousand women set up camp there and find themselves, for a week, living in a matriarchy. Meals are cooked in kitchen tents and eaten communally. There are workshops and classes. Some women don extravagant costumes; others wear nothing at all. There is free child care and a team to assist disabled women who ordinarily cannot go camping. Vogel describes the governing ethos as \u201cHow would a town look if we actually got to decide what was important?\u201d She told me, \u201cThere\u2019s something that I experience on the land when I walk at night without a flashlight in the woods and recognize that for that moment I feel completely safe. And there\u2019s nowhere else I can do that.\u201d She continued, \u201cIf, tomorrow, we said everyone is welcome, I\u2019m sure it would still be a really cool event, but that piece that allows women to let down their guard and feel that really deep sense of personal liberation would be different, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about.\u201d To transgender activists, Vogel\u2019s stance is laden with offensive assumptions: that trans women are different in an essential way from other women, and that they\u2019re dangerous. \u201cThe trope of trans women\u201d constituting \u201ca threat to women\u2019s spaces has been tossed around forever,\u201d Julia Serano told me. To her, it\u2019s akin to straight people refusing to share a locker room with gays or lesbians. Serano, forty-six, is a biologist by training who now spends most of her time writing and speaking on transgender issues and feminism; last year, she lectured at schools including Brown, Stanford, Smith, and Cornell. (Sheila Jeffreys attacks her in \u201cGender Hurts,\u201d using autobiographical details from Serano\u2019s first book, \u201cWhipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity\u201d (2007), to paint her as an autogynephile who seeks to \u201creinvent \u2018feminism\u2019 to fit his erotic interests.\u201d) In the summer of 2003, Serano joined about a hundred people at Camp Trans, a protest camp near the Michfest site, which has run intermittently since 1994. Serano said that relations with Michfest attendees were often unexpectedly cordial. A few years ago, though, Vogel says, some protesters committed acts of vandalism\u2014stealing electrical cables, cutting water pipes, keying cars in the parking lot, and spray-painting a six-foot penis, and the words \u201cReal Women Have Dicks,\u201d on the side of the main kitchen tent. Since then, as with the case of Olivia Records, the demonstrations have been supplanted by a boycott campaign. Last year, the Indigo Girls, longtime regulars at Michfest, announced that they wouldn\u2019t appear again until the event became trans-inclusive. This year, the scheduled headliners, Hunter Valentine, pulled out for the same reason. Performers who do appear face protests and boycotts of their own; the funk singer Shelley Nicole says that her band, blaKb\u00fcshe, was dropped from a show in Brooklyn because it is playing at Michfest next month. Before Sara St. Martin Lynne was asked to leave the Bay Area Girls Rock Camp board, she hadn\u2019t identified closely with radical feminism. Yet, as the campaign against Michfest\u2014and against radical feminism as a whole\u2014has grown, she\u2019s come to feel strongly about keeping the event \u201cwomyn-born-womyn.\u201d She said, \u201cThis moment where we\u2019re losing the ability to say the word \u2018woman\u2019 or to acknowledge the fact that being born female has lived consequences and meaning is kind of intense to me.\u201d One of the trans women who showed up at the Radfems Respond conference, a thirty-five-year-old software engineer from California, with a tiny nose stud and long brown hair, agrees. She understands why trans women are hurt by their exclusion from Michfest and other female-only events and facilities, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not really wanting to invade space. It\u2019s a deep-seated wanting to belong.\u201d But, she adds, \u201cif you\u2019re identifying with women, shouldn\u2019t you be empathizing with women?\u201d Sandy Stone shares this view\u2014up to a point.
