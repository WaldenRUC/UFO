'Tulip Mosque') is an 18th-century Ottoman imperial mosque located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey. The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque. Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories. Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764. According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion. On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim. The mosque was the centerpiece of a larger complex (k\u00fclliye) that included the Mustafa III's tomb, a nearby caravanserai which provided some revenues to the complex, a sebil, and a madrasa. Mustafa III was buried in the mausoleum attached to the complex after his death in 1774. The mosque and its complex were damaged by the 1766 earthquake and, according to \u00dcnver R\u00fcstem, by a fire in 1783. In 1783 it was fully restored. The restoration, which Do\u011fan Kuban attributes to the architect Seyit Mustafa Agha, preserved the original mosque's appearance. The mausoleum's fa\u00e7ade was updated with new marble window frames in the early 19th century. The madrasa of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1911. The mosque was built in the Ottoman Baroque style of its time. The layout is based on that of the earlier Selimiye Mosque of Edirne from the classical period, in accordance with Mustafa III's wishes. The decoration of the mosque and its complex is firmly baroque. The mosque incorporates thus the visual style of the earlier Nuruosmaniye Mosque \u2013 the first imperial mosque in the Ottoman Baroque style, completed by Mustafa III's predecessor \u2013 but in a more restrained way that integrates it with more traditional Ottoman architecture. The mosque was built on a high terrace over a complex of vaulted shops, whose rents were intended to financially support the mosque complex. Underneath the mosque structure itself is a great hall, supported by eight enormous pillars with a fountain in the center. The mosque is oriented along a northwest-southeast axis, and has a rectangular courtyard about twice the size of the prayer hall to the northwest. This courtyard has a continuous arcade with eighteen domed bays and an ablution fountain in the center. The mosque itself has a brick and masonry base, with a masonry superstructure and octagonal drum supporting the dome. There are two minarets located at either end of the portico flanking the courtyard entrances. The Laleli Mosque is an octagon inscribed within a rectangle, with a gallery on its western end. The walls make use of colorful variegated marbles in red, blue, yellow and browns, further decorated with medallions in opus sectile using also semi-precious onyx and jaspers. The mihrab and minbar are likewise richly decorated with precious marbles. The interior is well lit, with numerous windows in combinations of white and stained glass. The dome is 12.50 metres (41.0 feet) in diameter and 24.50 metres (80.4 feet) high on an octagonal drum of eight arches, with semi-domes at the corner arches and larger semi-domes joining the arches above the mihrab and the central bay of the narthex. Some of the structures of the Laleli Mosque's kulliye have disappeared over the years, but the mausoleum facing Ordu Street remains. It is an octagonal domed t\u00fcrbe and contains the graves of Mustafa III, his son and successor Selim III, and his daughters Hibetullah and Fatma Sultan and Mihrimah Sultan. The interior is decorated with reused \u0130znik tiles from the 16th century, and a band of calligraphy encircles the upper walls. In the graveyard next to the t\u00fcrbe is the tomb of Adil\u015fah Kad\u0131n, set within an ornate bronze grille representative of Ottoman metalwork at the time. The waqf (endowment) of the complex also included a number of buildings throughout the city which provided revenues for the upkeep of the mosque and its k\u00fclliye.

In that sense, the Fatih district can be assumed as the most historical district in Istanbul. And in that text, Laleli Mosque will be the headline. Laleli Mosque, in Turkish: Laleli Camii or Tulip Mosque, is built by Sultan Mustafa III in Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey. The foundation date of the Fatih Mosque is between 1760-1763. Sultan Mustafa III commissioned the architect Mehmet Tahir Agha to build the mosque. Also, the Sultan made a tomb for himself and his son in the complex of Laleli Camii. Table of Contents When it comes to the history of Laleli Mosque, the mosque was constructed as a complex, which consisted of a mosque, a soup kitchen, tombs of Sultan Mustafa III and his son Sultan Selim III, a fountain, a guest-house, and a hammam. However, a tough earthquake destroyed the outer parts of the complex, and the mosque, the tombs, and the fountain strengthened. Today these are the remained parts of the mosque. Laleli Mosque was named after Laleli Baba who was regarded as a custodian by Sultan Mustafa III. The tomb of Laleli Baba was in a place where close to the mosque, the tomb was moved to the complex, and the name of Laleli Baba was given to the mosque and the neighborhood after him. Laleli Mosque is the second example of Baroque architecture in the Ottoman Empire, the first one is Nuriosmaniye Mosque and Tophane Nusretiye Mosque. Although the construction is planned as Baroque, in the process of building, the plan was changed constantly, it that sense the final architecture of the mosque does not fit in the Baroque totally. Thus, Laleli Mosque is regarded as one of the significant architectural examples, it consists not just of Baroque, but also has the elements of Turkish architectural characteristics. Granite and marble were the construction materials that were used mostly in the construction. The outer part of the mosque is occupied by shops, little restaurants, etc. These shops are built in the place of the hammam which broke down and the shops\u2019 rents financially support the mosque. As a rectangular shape, the mosque has a fountain in the middle of its courtyard. It has one main dome and six semi-domes that supports the main one. The two minarets are located at the sides of the mosque. Both the inside and the outside of the mosque are furnished with the art of calligraphy. The interior has a wide plan, the walls are ornamented with marble in which the colors red, yellow, blue, and brown. All these ornaments make the inside of the mosque artistic. The mosque also possesses a special part for sultans. These parts were used as praying places for sultans and nobody can enter them. These special parts are called \u201cSultan Mahfili\u201d and Laleli Mosque also has one. At the inside mihrab and minbar were furnished lavishly with marble. These days, the complex just possesses the mosque, the tombs, and the fountain, however, after praying or a little tour of the mosque, you can visit the tombs of Sultan Mustafa III, his wife Mihrisah Sultan, his daughters Hibetullah Sultan, Fatma Sultan and Mihrimah Sultan, and his son Sultan Selim III. Their tombs are also furnished with Iznik tiles and the art of calligraphy on the walls. Madrasah and the guest-house are the ones which could not make it today. However, in the area of the guest-house, today the disorderly house was built. The building is in the northern part of the Laleli Mosque. You can make a donation to the mosque, but it\u2019s not obligatory, as always. Moreover, the mosque is still working, that\u2019s why at prayer times, the mosque will be closed. Lastly, fitting into the mosque etiquette will be better. Fatih district where Laleli Mosque is located is easy to reach. Bus lines which are 28T, 30D, 32T, 38, 39D, and 72T are the ones that go to Fatih. A Tram line named as Kabatas-Zeytinburnu might be another option to get Laleli.

It is located on Ali Ruhi Street. Its name, meaning \"the Mosque with Tulips\", is thought to be derived from the tulip motifs adorning its original minaret. Originally a small medieval chapel, it was enlarged and converted to a mosque in the 19th century. It is understood from the mosque's architecture that the building was originally a medieval chapel. After the Ottoman conquest, it was initially converted to a small mosque without a minaret (mescit), and was known as \"Laleli Cami-i Minareli Mescidi\" in the 18th century. In the late 20th century, a marble inscription dated to 1742-43 was found in a building at the southwestern corner of the mosque's courtyard. Written in the talik style by a calligrapher named \"\u00c2rif\", the inscription revealed the existence of a teacher's school (\"Laleli Cami-i Minareli Mescit Muallimh\u00e2ne Mektebi\") at the site at the time. In 1827, it was enlarged by the addition of a minaret, minbar, mihrab, a new ceiling and a narthex (son cemaat yeri) and thus converted into a full mosque. The construction was financed by Ali Ruhi Efendi, the governor of Cyprus at the time, and the mosque was inscribed amongst the property of the newly founded Ali Ruhi Efendi Foundation on 24 December 1827 for maintenance. The responsibility for the maintenance changed hands over the course of the 19th century, as it was recorded amongst the property of Seyit Mehmet A\u011fa Foundation in 1906. Ali Ruhi Efendi also had a primary school (s\u0131byan mektebi) constructed next to the mosque. In 1893 it was reported that the school consisted of a small room next to the mosque and was in disrepair, meaning that 80 children had to study in crowded and unhealthy conditions. The inhabitants of the Abdi \u00c7avu\u015f quarter requested that the Evkaf Administration enlarge the school, and a renowned constructor of the time, Nikolaki Kalla, was entrusted with the construction. An arch was added to enlarge the building. The next mention of the school building was recorded in the 1930s, when the building, then in the inventory of Debba\u011f Dervi\u015f Efendi Foundation, was rented out to a certain M. Sad\u0131k, who used it as a sewing school for girls. No trace of the building survives to this day. A marble inscription that stood on its wall and praised Ali Ruhi Efendi was removed in 1965 and placed in the Mevlevi Tekke Museum. The mosque was repaired in the late 19th century by the Ottoman Imperial Ministry of Religious Foundations (Turkish: Evkaf-\u0131 H\u00fcmayun Nezareti). A new minbar, which stands to this day, was ordered in 1895 from carpenter Hac\u0131 Hasan in exchange for a payment of \u00a34. The mosque was further repaired by Nikolaki Kalla in 1908. The minaret of the mosque was demolished in 1978-79 as it was \"dangerous\" and replaced with the current one. The mosque lies in its separate garden, segregated from the rest of the neighbourhood with a high wall. The garden is entered via an arched gate. The mosque is rectangular in structure and has a length of 12.85 m and a width of 3.30 m. The narthex (son cemaat yeri) lies to the north and has three pointed arches. The entrance to the prayer area (harim) is through another pointed arch, above which is an inscription dated 1827 that praises Ali Ruhi Efendi. To the east of the prayer area lies the apse of the former chapel. The painted mihrab has decorations of flowers and leaves. A wooden women's area (kad\u0131nlar mahfili) is accessed via a door and a wooden staircase in the western part of the mosque. The original minaret of the mosque was made of cut stone and its balcony (\u015ferefe) was ornamented. The current minaret at the northeastern side does not retain any of its characteristics. In the garden stands a fountain constructed in 1826-27 by Ali Ruhi Efendi with an inscription that dedicates the fountain to his mother.\n\nquestion: Where is the Laleli Mosque located?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "North Nicosia", "usage": 1046}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

'Tulip Mosque') is an 18th-century Ottoman imperial mosque located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey. The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque. Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories. Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764. According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion. On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim. The mosque was the centerpiece of a larger complex (k\u00fclliye) that included the Mustafa III's tomb, a nearby caravanserai which provided some revenues to the complex, a sebil, and a madrasa. Mustafa III was buried in the mausoleum attached to the complex after his death in 1774. The mosque and its complex were damaged by the 1766 earthquake and, according to \u00dcnver R\u00fcstem, by a fire in 1783. In 1783 it was fully restored. The restoration, which Do\u011fan Kuban attributes to the architect Seyit Mustafa Agha, preserved the original mosque's appearance. The mausoleum's fa\u00e7ade was updated with new marble window frames in the early 19th century. The madrasa of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1911. The mosque was built in the Ottoman Baroque style of its time. The layout is based on that of the earlier Selimiye Mosque of Edirne from the classical period, in accordance with Mustafa III's wishes. The decoration of the mosque and its complex is firmly baroque. The mosque incorporates thus the visual style of the earlier Nuruosmaniye Mosque \u2013 the first imperial mosque in the Ottoman Baroque style, completed by Mustafa III's predecessor \u2013 but in a more restrained way that integrates it with more traditional Ottoman architecture. The mosque was built on a high terrace over a complex of vaulted shops, whose rents were intended to financially support the mosque complex. Underneath the mosque structure itself is a great hall, supported by eight enormous pillars with a fountain in the center. The mosque is oriented along a northwest-southeast axis, and has a rectangular courtyard about twice the size of the prayer hall to the northwest. This courtyard has a continuous arcade with eighteen domed bays and an ablution fountain in the center. The mosque itself has a brick and masonry base, with a masonry superstructure and octagonal drum supporting the dome. There are two minarets located at either end of the portico flanking the courtyard entrances. The Laleli Mosque is an octagon inscribed within a rectangle, with a gallery on its western end. The walls make use of colorful variegated marbles in red, blue, yellow and browns, further decorated with medallions in opus sectile using also semi-precious onyx and jaspers. The mihrab and minbar are likewise richly decorated with precious marbles. The interior is well lit, with numerous windows in combinations of white and stained glass. The dome is 12.50 metres (41.0 feet) in diameter and 24.50 metres (80.4 feet) high on an octagonal drum of eight arches, with semi-domes at the corner arches and larger semi-domes joining the arches above the mihrab and the central bay of the narthex. Some of the structures of the Laleli Mosque's kulliye have disappeared over the years, but the mausoleum facing Ordu Street remains. It is an octagonal domed t\u00fcrbe and contains the graves of Mustafa III, his son and successor Selim III, and his daughters Hibetullah and Fatma Sultan and Mihrimah Sultan. The interior is decorated with reused \u0130znik tiles from the 16th century, and a band of calligraphy encircles the upper walls. In the graveyard next to the t\u00fcrbe is the tomb of Adil\u015fah Kad\u0131n, set within an ornate bronze grille representative of Ottoman metalwork at the time. The waqf (endowment) of the complex also included a number of buildings throughout the city which provided revenues for the upkeep of the mosque and its k\u00fclliye. Among the notable inclusions were\n\nquestion: Where is the Esma Sultan Mansion located?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1125}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The three-storey brick manor was designed by the renowned architect Sarkis Balyan and finished in 1875 next to Ortak\u00f6y Mosque. It was presented to the Princess Esma Sultan, the daughter of Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz, as a wedding gift in 1889. The mansion remained in the possession of the Ottoman dynasty until 1915. Subsequently, the building was used first as a tobacco warehouse and then as a coal depot from 1920 until 1975 when it was destroyed by a fire. The ruin, consisting only of the outer walls of the building, was purchased in the early 1990s by The Marmara Collection. Following a renovation with additions designed by architects Haluk Sezgin and Philippe Robert, the mansion was opened in 2001 as a multipurpose event venue. Within the brick exterior, which was left as the original, a steel and glass structure is incorporated.

In that sense, the Fatih district can be assumed as the most historical district in Istanbul. And in that text, Laleli Mosque will be the headline. Laleli Mosque, in Turkish: Laleli Camii or Tulip Mosque, is built by Sultan Mustafa III in Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey. The foundation date of the Fatih Mosque is between 1760-1763. Sultan Mustafa III commissioned the architect Mehmet Tahir Agha to build the mosque. Also, the Sultan made a tomb for himself and his son in the complex of Laleli Camii. Table of Contents When it comes to the history of Laleli Mosque, the mosque was constructed as a complex, which consisted of a mosque, a soup kitchen, tombs of Sultan Mustafa III and his son Sultan Selim III, a fountain, a guest-house, and a hammam. However, a tough earthquake destroyed the outer parts of the complex, and the mosque, the tombs, and the fountain strengthened. Today these are the remained parts of the mosque. Laleli Mosque was named after Laleli Baba who was regarded as a custodian by Sultan Mustafa III. The tomb of Laleli Baba was in a place where close to the mosque, the tomb was moved to the complex, and the name of Laleli Baba was given to the mosque and the neighborhood after him. Laleli Mosque is the second example of Baroque architecture in the Ottoman Empire, the first one is Nuriosmaniye Mosque and Tophane Nusretiye Mosque. Although the construction is planned as Baroque, in the process of building, the plan was changed constantly, it that sense the final architecture of the mosque does not fit in the Baroque totally. Thus, Laleli Mosque is regarded as one of the significant architectural examples, it consists not just of Baroque, but also has the elements of Turkish architectural characteristics. Granite and marble were the construction materials that were used mostly in the construction. The outer part of the mosque is occupied by shops, little restaurants, etc. These shops are built in the place of the hammam which broke down and the shops\u2019 rents financially support the mosque. As a rectangular shape, the mosque has a fountain in the middle of its courtyard. It has one main dome and six semi-domes that supports the main one. The two minarets are located at the sides of the mosque. Both the inside and the outside of the mosque are furnished with the art of calligraphy. The interior has a wide plan, the walls are ornamented with marble in which the colors red, yellow, blue, and brown. All these ornaments make the inside of the mosque artistic. The mosque also possesses a special part for sultans. These parts were used as praying places for sultans and nobody can enter them. These special parts are called \u201cSultan Mahfili\u201d and Laleli Mosque also has one. At the inside mihrab and minbar were furnished lavishly with marble. These days, the complex just possesses the mosque, the tombs, and the fountain, however, after praying or a little tour of the mosque, you can visit the tombs of Sultan Mustafa III, his wife Mihrisah Sultan, his daughters Hibetullah Sultan, Fatma Sultan and Mihrimah Sultan, and his son Sultan Selim III. Their tombs are also furnished with Iznik tiles and the art of calligraphy on the walls. Madrasah and the guest-house are the ones which could not make it today. However, in the area of the guest-house, today the disorderly house was built. The building is in the northern part of the Laleli Mosque. You can make a donation to the mosque, but it\u2019s not obligatory, as always. Moreover, the mosque is still working, that\u2019s why at prayer times, the mosque will be closed. Lastly, fitting into the mosque etiquette will be better. Fatih district where Laleli Mosque is located is easy to reach. Bus lines which are 28T, 30D, 32T, 38, 39D, and 72T are the ones that go to Fatih. A Tram line named as Kabatas-Zeytinburnu might be another option to get Laleli.

It is located on Ali Ruhi Street. Its name, meaning \"the Mosque with Tulips\", is thought to be derived from the tulip motifs adorning its original minaret. Originally a small medieval chapel, it was enlarged and converted to a mosque in the 19th century. It is understood from the mosque's architecture that the building was originally a medieval chapel. After the Ottoman conquest, it was initially converted to a small mosque without a minaret (mescit), and was known as \"Laleli Cami-i Minareli Mescidi\" in the 18th century. In the late 20th century, a marble inscription dated to 1742-43 was found in a building at the southwestern corner of the mosque's courtyard. Written in the talik style by a calligrapher named \"\u00c2rif\", the inscription revealed the existence of a teacher's school (\"Laleli Cami-i Minareli Mescit Muallimh\u00e2ne Mektebi\") at the site at the time. In 1827, it was enlarged by the addition of a minaret, minbar, mihrab, a new ceiling and a narthex (son cemaat yeri) and thus converted into a full mosque. The construction was financed by Ali Ruhi Efendi, the governor of Cyprus at the time, and the mosque was inscribed amongst the property of the newly founded Ali Ruhi Efendi Foundation on 24 December 1827 for maintenance. The responsibility for the maintenance changed hands over the course of the 19th century, as it was recorded amongst the property of Seyit Mehmet A\u011fa Foundation in 1906. Ali Ruhi Efendi also had a primary school (s\u0131byan mektebi) constructed next to the mosque. In 1893 it was reported that the school consisted of a small room next to the mosque and was in disrepair, meaning that 80 children had to study in crowded and unhealthy conditions. The inhabitants of the Abdi \u00c7avu\u015f quarter requested that the Evkaf Administration enlarge the school, and a renowned constructor of the time, Nikolaki Kalla, was entrusted with the construction. An arch was added to enlarge the building. The next mention of the school building was recorded in the 1930s, when the building, then in the inventory of Debba\u011f Dervi\u015f Efendi Foundation, was rented out to a certain M. Sad\u0131k, who used it as a sewing school for girls. No trace of the building survives to this day. A marble inscription that stood on its wall and praised Ali Ruhi Efendi was removed in 1965 and placed in the Mevlevi Tekke Museum. The mosque was repaired in the late 19th century by the Ottoman Imperial Ministry of Religious Foundations (Turkish: Evkaf-\u0131 H\u00fcmayun Nezareti). A new minbar, which stands to this day, was ordered in 1895 from carpenter Hac\u0131 Hasan in exchange for a payment of \u00a34. The mosque was further repaired by Nikolaki Kalla in 1908. The minaret of the mosque was demolished in 1978-79 as it was \"dangerous\" and replaced with the current one. The mosque lies in its separate garden, segregated from the rest of the neighbourhood with a high wall. The garden is entered via an arched gate. The mosque is rectangular in structure and has a length of 12.85 m and a width of 3.30 m. The narthex (son cemaat yeri) lies to the north and has three pointed arches. The entrance to the prayer area (harim) is through another pointed arch, above which is an inscription dated 1827 that praises Ali Ruhi Efendi. To the east of the prayer area lies the apse of the former chapel. The painted mihrab has decorations of flowers and leaves. A wooden women's area (kad\u0131nlar mahfili) is accessed via a door and a wooden staircase in the western part of the mosque. The original minaret of the mosque was made of cut stone and its balcony (\u015ferefe) was ornamented. The current minaret at the northeastern side does not retain any of its characteristics. In the garden stands a fountain constructed in 1826-27 by Ali Ruhi Efendi with an inscription that dedicates the fountain to his mother.\n\nquestion: Where is the Esma Sultan Mansion located?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1044}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

'Tulip Mosque') is an 18th-century Ottoman imperial mosque located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey. The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque. Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories. Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764. According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion. On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim. The mosque was the centerpiece of a larger complex (k\u00fclliye) that included the Mustafa III's tomb, a nearby caravanserai which provided some revenues to the complex, a sebil, and a madrasa. Mustafa III was buried in the mausoleum attached to the complex after his death in 1774. The mosque and its complex were damaged by the 1766 earthquake and, according to \u00dcnver R\u00fcstem, by a fire in 1783. In 1783 it was fully restored. The restoration, which Do\u011fan Kuban attributes to the architect Seyit Mustafa Agha, preserved the original mosque's appearance. The mausoleum's fa\u00e7ade was updated with new marble window frames in the early 19th century. The madrasa of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1911. The mosque was built in the Ottoman Baroque style of its time. The layout is based on that of the earlier Selimiye Mosque of Edirne from the classical period, in accordance with Mustafa III's wishes. The decoration of the mosque and its complex is firmly baroque. The mosque incorporates thus the visual style of the earlier Nuruosmaniye Mosque \u2013 the first imperial mosque in the Ottoman Baroque style, completed by Mustafa III's predecessor \u2013 but in a more restrained way that integrates it with more traditional Ottoman architecture. The mosque was built on a high terrace over a complex of vaulted shops, whose rents were intended to financially support the mosque complex. Underneath the mosque structure itself is a great hall, supported by eight enormous pillars with a fountain in the center. The mosque is oriented along a northwest-southeast axis, and has a rectangular courtyard about twice the size of the prayer hall to the northwest. This courtyard has a continuous arcade with eighteen domed bays and an ablution fountain in the center. The mosque itself has a brick and masonry base, with a masonry superstructure and octagonal drum supporting the dome. There are two minarets located at either end of the portico flanking the courtyard entrances. The Laleli Mosque is an octagon inscribed within a rectangle, with a gallery on its western end. The walls make use of colorful variegated marbles in red, blue, yellow and browns, further decorated with medallions in opus sectile using also semi-precious onyx and jaspers. The mihrab and minbar are likewise richly decorated with precious marbles. The interior is well lit, with numerous windows in combinations of white and stained glass. The dome is 12.50 metres (41.0 feet) in diameter and 24.50 metres (80.4 feet) high on an octagonal drum of eight arches, with semi-domes at the corner arches and larger semi-domes joining the arches above the mihrab and the central bay of the narthex. Some of the structures of the Laleli Mosque's kulliye have disappeared over the years, but the mausoleum facing Ordu Street remains. It is an octagonal domed t\u00fcrbe and contains the graves of Mustafa III, his son and successor Selim III, and his daughters Hibetullah and Fatma Sultan and Mihrimah Sultan. The interior is decorated with reused \u0130znik tiles from the 16th century, and a band of calligraphy encircles the upper walls. In the graveyard next to the t\u00fcrbe is the tomb of Adil\u015fah Kad\u0131n, set within an ornate bronze grille representative of Ottoman metalwork at the time. The waqf (endowment) of the complex also included a number of buildings throughout the city which provided revenues for the upkeep of the mosque and its k\u00fclliye.

The three-storey brick manor was designed by the renowned architect Sarkis Balyan and finished in 1875 next to Ortak\u00f6y Mosque. It was presented to the Princess Esma Sultan, the daughter of Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz, as a wedding gift in 1889. The mansion remained in the possession of the Ottoman dynasty until 1915. Subsequently, the building was used first as a tobacco warehouse and then as a coal depot from 1920 until 1975 when it was destroyed by a fire. The ruin, consisting only of the outer walls of the building, was purchased in the early 1990s by The Marmara Collection. Following a renovation with additions designed by architects Haluk Sezgin and Philippe Robert, the mansion was opened in 2001 as a multipurpose event venue. Within the brick exterior, which was left as the original, a steel and glass structure is incorporated. According to the GAD Architecture Group, a redesign by the architect G\u00f6khan Avc\u0131o\u011flu was completed in 2005.

In that sense, the Fatih district can be assumed as the most historical district in Istanbul. And in that text, Laleli Mosque will be the headline. Laleli Mosque, in Turkish: Laleli Camii or Tulip Mosque, is built by Sultan Mustafa III in Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey. The foundation date of the Fatih Mosque is between 1760-1763. Sultan Mustafa III commissioned the architect Mehmet Tahir Agha to build the mosque. Also, the Sultan made a tomb for himself and his son in the complex of Laleli Camii. Table of Contents When it comes to the history of Laleli Mosque, the mosque was constructed as a complex, which consisted of a mosque, a soup kitchen, tombs of Sultan Mustafa III and his son Sultan Selim III, a fountain, a guest-house, and a hammam. However, a tough earthquake destroyed the outer parts of the complex, and the mosque, the tombs, and the fountain strengthened. Today these are the remained parts of the mosque. Laleli Mosque was named after Laleli Baba who was regarded as a custodian by Sultan Mustafa III. The tomb of Laleli Baba was in a place where close to the mosque, the tomb was moved to the complex, and the name of Laleli Baba was given to the mosque and the neighborhood after him. Laleli Mosque is the second example of Baroque architecture in the Ottoman Empire, the first one is Nuriosmaniye Mosque and Tophane Nusretiye Mosque. Although the construction is planned as Baroque, in the process of building, the plan was changed constantly, it that sense the final architecture of the mosque does not fit in the Baroque totally. Thus, Laleli Mosque is regarded as one of the significant architectural examples, it consists not just of Baroque, but also has the elements of Turkish architectural characteristics. Granite and marble were the construction materials that were used mostly in the construction. The outer part of the mosque is occupied by shops, little restaurants, etc. These shops are built in the place of the hammam which broke down and the shops\u2019 rents financially support the mosque. As a rectangular shape, the mosque has a fountain in the middle of its courtyard. It has one main dome and six semi-domes that supports the main one. The two minarets are located at the sides of the mosque. Both the inside and the outside of the mosque are furnished with the art of calligraphy. The interior has a wide plan, the walls are ornamented with marble in which the colors red, yellow, blue, and brown. All these ornaments make the inside of the mosque artistic. The mosque also possesses a special part for sultans. These parts were used as praying places for sultans and nobody can enter them. These special parts are called \u201cSultan Mahfili\u201d and Laleli Mosque also has one. At the inside mihrab and minbar were furnished lavishly with marble. These days, the complex just possesses the mosque, the tombs, and the fountain, however, after praying or a little tour of the mosque, you can visit the tombs of Sultan Mustafa III, his wife Mihrisah Sultan, his daughters Hibetullah Sultan, Fatma Sultan and Mihrimah Sultan, and his son Sultan Selim III. Their tombs are also furnished with Iznik tiles and the art of calligraphy on the walls. Madrasah and the guest-house are the ones which could not make it today. However, in the area of the guest-house, today the disorderly house was built. The building is in the northern part of the Laleli Mosque. You can make a donation to the mosque, but it\u2019s not obligatory, as always. Moreover, the mosque is still working, that\u2019s why at prayer times, the mosque will be closed. Lastly, fitting into the mosque etiquette will be better. Fatih district where Laleli Mosque is located is easy to reach. Bus lines which are 28T, 30D, 32T, 38, 39D, and 72T are the ones that go to Fatih. A Tram line named as Kabatas-Zeytinburnu might be another option to get Laleli.

It is located on Ali Ruhi Street. Its name, meaning \"the Mosque with Tulips\", is thought to be derived from the tulip motifs adorning its original minaret. Originally a small medieval chapel, it was enlarged and converted to a mosque in the 19th century. It is understood from the mosque's architecture that the building was originally a medieval chapel. After the Ottoman conquest, it was initially converted to a small mosque without a minaret (mescit), and was known as \"Laleli Cami-i Minareli Mescidi\" in the 18th century. In the late 20th century, a marble inscription dated to 1742-43 was found in a building at the southwestern corner of the mosque's courtyard. Written in the talik style by a calligrapher named \"\u00c2rif\", the inscription revealed the existence of a teacher's school (\"Laleli Cami-i Minareli Mescit Muallimh\u00e2ne Mektebi\") at the site at the time. In 1827, it was enlarged by the addition of a minaret, minbar, mihrab, a new ceiling and a narthex (son cemaat yeri) and thus converted into a full mosque. The construction was financed by Ali Ruhi Efendi, the governor of Cyprus at the time, and the mosque was inscribed amongst the property of the newly founded Ali Ruhi Efendi Foundation on 24 December 1827 for maintenance. The responsibility for the maintenance changed hands over the course of the 19th century, as it was recorded amongst the property of Seyit Mehmet A\u011fa Foundation in 1906. Ali Ruhi Efendi also had a primary school (s\u0131byan mektebi) constructed next to the mosque. In 1893 it was reported that the school consisted of a small room next to the mosque and was in disrepair, meaning that 80 children had to study in crowded and unhealthy conditions. The inhabitants of the Abdi \u00c7avu\u015f quarter requested that the Evkaf Administration enlarge the school, and a renowned constructor of the time, Nikolaki Kalla, was entrusted with the construction. An arch was added to enlarge the building. The next mention of the school building was recorded in the 1930s, when the building, then in the inventory of Debba\u011f Dervi\u015f Efendi Foundation, was rented out to a certain M. Sad\u0131k, who used it as a sewing school for girls. No trace of the building survives to this day. A marble inscription that stood on its wall and praised Ali Ruhi Efendi was removed in 1965 and placed in the Mevlevi Tekke Museum. The mosque was repaired in the late 19th century by the Ottoman Imperial Ministry of Religious Foundations (Turkish: Evkaf-\u0131 H\u00fcmayun Nezareti). A new minbar, which stands to this day, was ordered in 1895 from carpenter Hac\u0131 Hasan in exchange for a payment of \u00a34. The mosque was further repaired by Nikolaki Kalla in 1908. The minaret of the mosque was demolished in 1978-79 as it was \"dangerous\" and replaced with the current one. The mosque lies in its separate garden, segregated from the rest of the neighbourhood with a high wall. The garden is entered via an arched gate. The mosque is rectangular in structure and has a length of 12.85 m and a width of 3.30 m. The narthex (son cemaat yeri) lies to the north and has three pointed arches. The entrance to the prayer area (harim) is through another pointed arch, above which is an inscription dated 1827 that praises Ali Ruhi Efendi. To the east of the prayer area lies the apse of the former chapel. The painted mihrab has decorations of flowers and leaves. A wooden women's area (kad\u0131nlar mahfili) is accessed via a door and a wooden staircase in the western part of the mosque. The original minaret of the mosque was made of cut stone and its balcony (\u015ferefe) was ornamented. The current minaret at the northeastern side does not retain any of its characteristics. In the garden stands a fountain constructed in 1826-27 by Ali Ruhi Efendi with an inscription that dedicates the fountain to his mother.\n\nquestion: Are the Laleli Mosque and Esma Sultan Mansion located in the same neighborhood?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1052}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

'Tulip Mosque') is an 18th-century Ottoman imperial mosque located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey. The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque. Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories. Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764. According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion. On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim. The mosque was the centerpiece of a larger complex (k\u00fclliye) that included the Mustafa III's tomb, a nearby caravanserai which provided some revenues to the complex, a sebil, and a madrasa. Mustafa III was buried in the mausoleum attached to the complex after his death in 1774. The mosque and its complex were damaged by the 1766 earthquake and, according to \u00dcnver R\u00fcstem, by a fire in 1783. In 1783 it was fully restored. The restoration, which Do\u011fan Kuban attributes to the architect Seyit Mustafa Agha, preserved the original mosque's appearance. The mausoleum's fa\u00e7ade was updated with new marble window frames in the early 19th century. The madrasa of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1911. The mosque was built in the Ottoman Baroque style of its time. The layout is based on that of the earlier Selimiye Mosque of Edirne from the classical period, in accordance with Mustafa III's wishes. The decoration of the mosque and its complex is firmly baroque. The mosque incorporates thus the visual style of the earlier Nuruosmaniye Mosque \u2013 the first imperial mosque in the Ottoman Baroque style, completed by Mustafa III's predecessor \u2013 but in a more restrained way that integrates it with more traditional Ottoman architecture. The mosque was built on a high terrace over a complex of vaulted shops, whose rents were intended to financially support the mosque complex. Underneath the mosque structure itself is a great hall, supported by eight enormous pillars with a fountain in the center. The mosque is oriented along a northwest-southeast axis, and has a rectangular courtyard about twice the size of the prayer hall to the northwest. This courtyard has a continuous arcade with eighteen domed bays and an ablution fountain in the center. The mosque itself has a brick and masonry base, with a masonry superstructure and octagonal drum supporting the dome. There are two minarets located at either end of the portico flanking the courtyard entrances. The Laleli Mosque is an octagon inscribed within a rectangle, with a gallery on its western end. The walls make use of colorful variegated marbles in red, blue, yellow and browns, further decorated with medallions in opus sectile using also semi-precious onyx and jaspers. The mihrab and minbar are likewise richly decorated with precious marbles. The interior is well lit, with numerous windows in combinations of white and stained glass. The dome is 12.50 metres (41.0 feet) in diameter and 24.50 metres (80.4 feet) high on an octagonal drum of eight arches, with semi-domes at the corner arches and larger semi-domes joining the arches above the mihrab and the central bay of the narthex. Some of the structures of the Laleli Mosque's kulliye have disappeared over the years, but the mausoleum facing Ordu Street remains. It is an octagonal domed t\u00fcrbe and contains the graves of Mustafa III, his son and successor Selim III, and his daughters Hibetullah and Fatma Sultan and Mihrimah Sultan. The interior is decorated with reused \u0130znik tiles from the 16th century, and a band of calligraphy encircles the upper walls. In the graveyard next to the t\u00fcrbe is the tomb of Adil\u015fah Kad\u0131n, set within an ornate bronze grille representative of Ottoman metalwork at the time. The waqf (endowment) of the complex also included a number of buildings throughout the city which provided revenues for the upkeep of the mosque and its k\u00fclliye.

The three-storey brick manor was designed by the renowned architect Sarkis Balyan and finished in 1875 next to Ortak\u00f6y Mosque. It was presented to the Princess Esma Sultan, the daughter of Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz, as a wedding gift in 1889. The mansion remained in the possession of the Ottoman dynasty until 1915. Subsequently, the building was used first as a tobacco warehouse and then as a coal depot from 1920 until 1975 when it was destroyed by a fire. The ruin, consisting only of the outer walls of the building, was purchased in the early 1990s by The Marmara Collection. Following a renovation with additions designed by architects Haluk Sezgin and Philippe Robert, the mansion was opened in 2001 as a multipurpose event venue. Within the brick exterior, which was left as the original, a steel and glass structure is incorporated. According to the GAD Architecture Group, a redesign by the architect G\u00f6khan Avc\u0131o\u011flu was completed in 2005. The building includes a bar, a restaurant, and an event hall at several levels. The building is situated in a garden of 2,226 m2 (23,960 sq ft).

In that sense, the Fatih district can be assumed as the most historical district in Istanbul. And in that text, Laleli Mosque will be the headline. Laleli Mosque, in Turkish: Laleli Camii or Tulip Mosque, is built by Sultan Mustafa III in Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey. The foundation date of the Fatih Mosque is between 1760-1763. Sultan Mustafa III commissioned the architect Mehmet Tahir Agha to build the mosque. Also, the Sultan made a tomb for himself and his son in the complex of Laleli Camii. Table of Contents When it comes to the history of Laleli Mosque, the mosque was constructed as a complex, which consisted of a mosque, a soup kitchen, tombs of Sultan Mustafa III and his son Sultan Selim III, a fountain, a guest-house, and a hammam. However, a tough earthquake destroyed the outer parts of the complex, and the mosque, the tombs, and the fountain strengthened. Today these are the remained parts of the mosque. Laleli Mosque was named after Laleli Baba who was regarded as a custodian by Sultan Mustafa III. The tomb of Laleli Baba was in a place where close to the mosque, the tomb was moved to the complex, and the name of Laleli Baba was given to the mosque and the neighborhood after him. Laleli Mosque is the second example of Baroque architecture in the Ottoman Empire, the first one is Nuriosmaniye Mosque and Tophane Nusretiye Mosque. Although the construction is planned as Baroque, in the process of building, the plan was changed constantly, it that sense the final architecture of the mosque does not fit in the Baroque totally. Thus, Laleli Mosque is regarded as one of the significant architectural examples, it consists not just of Baroque, but also has the elements of Turkish architectural characteristics. Granite and marble were the construction materials that were used mostly in the construction. The outer part of the mosque is occupied by shops, little restaurants, etc. These shops are built in the place of the hammam which broke down and the shops\u2019 rents financially support the mosque. As a rectangular shape, the mosque has a fountain in the middle of its courtyard. It has one main dome and six semi-domes that supports the main one. The two minarets are located at the sides of the mosque. Both the inside and the outside of the mosque are furnished with the art of calligraphy. The interior has a wide plan, the walls are ornamented with marble in which the colors red, yellow, blue, and brown. All these ornaments make the inside of the mosque artistic. The mosque also possesses a special part for sultans. These parts were used as praying places for sultans and nobody can enter them. These special parts are called \u201cSultan Mahfili\u201d and Laleli Mosque also has one. At the inside mihrab and minbar were furnished lavishly with marble. These days, the complex just possesses the mosque, the tombs, and the fountain, however, after praying or a little tour of the mosque, you can visit the tombs of Sultan Mustafa III, his wife Mihrisah Sultan, his daughters Hibetullah Sultan, Fatma Sultan and Mihrimah Sultan, and his son Sultan Selim III. Their tombs are also furnished with Iznik tiles and the art of calligraphy on the walls. Madrasah and the guest-house are the ones which could not make it today. However, in the area of the guest-house, today the disorderly house was built. The building is in the northern part of the Laleli Mosque. You can make a donation to the mosque, but it\u2019s not obligatory, as always. Moreover, the mosque is still working, that\u2019s why at prayer times, the mosque will be closed. Lastly, fitting into the mosque etiquette will be better. Fatih district where Laleli Mosque is located is easy to reach. Bus lines which are 28T, 30D, 32T, 38, 39D, and 72T are the ones that go to Fatih. A Tram line named as Kabatas-Zeytinburnu might be another option to get Laleli.

It is located on Ali Ruhi Street. Its name, meaning \"the Mosque with Tulips\", is thought to be derived from the tulip motifs adorning its original minaret. Originally a small medieval chapel, it was enlarged and converted to a mosque in the 19th century. It is understood from the mosque's architecture that the building was originally a medieval chapel. After the Ottoman conquest, it was initially converted to a small mosque without a minaret (mescit), and was known as \"Laleli Cami-i Minareli Mescidi\" in the 18th century. In the late 20th century, a marble inscription dated to 1742-43 was found in a building at the southwestern corner of the mosque's courtyard. Written in the talik style by a calligrapher named \"\u00c2rif\", the inscription revealed the existence of a teacher's school (\"Laleli Cami-i Minareli Mescit Muallimh\u00e2ne Mektebi\") at the site at the time. In 1827, it was enlarged by the addition of a minaret, minbar, mihrab, a new ceiling and a narthex (son cemaat yeri) and thus converted into a full mosque. The construction was financed by Ali Ruhi Efendi, the governor of Cyprus at the time, and the mosque was inscribed amongst the property of the newly founded Ali Ruhi Efendi Foundation on 24 December 1827 for maintenance. The responsibility for the maintenance changed hands over the course of the 19th century, as it was recorded amongst the property of Seyit Mehmet A\u011fa Foundation in 1906. Ali Ruhi Efendi also had a primary school (s\u0131byan mektebi) constructed next to the mosque. In 1893 it was reported that the school consisted of a small room next to the mosque and was in disrepair, meaning that 80 children had to study in crowded and unhealthy conditions. The inhabitants of the Abdi \u00c7avu\u015f quarter requested that the Evkaf Administration enlarge the school, and a renowned constructor of the time, Nikolaki Kalla, was entrusted with the construction. An arch was added to enlarge the building. The next mention of the school building was recorded in the 1930s, when the building, then in the inventory of Debba\u011f Dervi\u015f Efendi Foundation, was rented out to a certain M. Sad\u0131k, who used it as a sewing school for girls. No trace of the building survives to this day. A marble inscription that stood on its wall and praised Ali Ruhi Efendi was removed in 1965 and placed in the Mevlevi Tekke Museum. The mosque was repaired in the late 19th century by the Ottoman Imperial Ministry of Religious Foundations (Turkish: Evkaf-\u0131 H\u00fcmayun Nezareti). A new minbar, which stands to this day, was ordered in 1895 from carpenter Hac\u0131 Hasan in exchange for a payment of \u00a34. The mosque was further repaired by Nikolaki Kalla in 1908. The minaret of the mosque was demolished in 1978-79 as it was \"dangerous\" and replaced with the current one. The mosque lies in its separate garden, segregated from the rest of the neighbourhood with a high wall. The garden is entered via an arched gate. The mosque is rectangular in structure and has a length of 12.85 m and a width of 3.30 m. The narthex (son cemaat yeri) lies to the north and has three pointed arches. The entrance to the prayer area (harim) is through another pointed arch, above which is an inscription dated 1827 that praises Ali Ruhi Efendi. To the east of the prayer area lies the apse of the former chapel. The painted mihrab has decorations of flowers and leaves. A wooden women's area (kad\u0131nlar mahfili) is accessed via a door and a wooden staircase in the western part of the mosque. The original minaret of the mosque was made of cut stone and its balcony (\u015ferefe) was ornamented. The current minaret at the northeastern side does not retain any of its characteristics. In the garden stands a fountain constructed in 1826-27 by Ali Ruhi Efendi with an inscription that dedicates the fountain to his mother.\n\nquestion: What is the relationship between the locations of the Laleli Mosque and Esma Sultan Mansion?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1054}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.
