The New York Society of Model Engineers (NYSME) was originally incorporated in 1926 in New York City.  There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905.  In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan.  AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout.  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces.  Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.  This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.  They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time.  The space?  Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City.  Here the layout was built.  It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa.  It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.  During the early-1950s the organization moved to its current location in Carlstadt, New Jersey.\nquestion: Who is the director of the romantic comedy 'Big Stone Gap'?\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 528}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The New York Society of Model Engineers (NYSME) was originally incorporated in 1926 in New York City.  There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905.  In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan.  AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout.  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces.  Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.  This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.  They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time.  The space?  Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City.  Here the layout was built.  It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa.  It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.  During the early-1950s the organization moved to its current location in Carlstadt, New Jersey.\n\nquestion: Who is the director of the romantic comedy 'Big Stone Gap'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 527}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Her momma fled to America when she became pregnant. She met and married Fred Mulligan, who knew she was pregnant and never much liked Ave. At the pharmacy, some popular teenage girl customers direct rude comments at Pearl Grimes, a poor teenager who is a Melungeon.

Meanwhile, Jack's mother confronts him about Sweet Sue, whom she dislikes. Jack admits he wants the love that his parents had, does not love Sue but does care for her two young boys. Jack finally approaches Ave. They take an evening walk and he tells her that he broke up with Sue, as he has always had a crush on the little Italian girl that sat beside him in elementary school. He tells her that they ought to get married. Ave storms off, offended that he doesn't even think she's worth being courted. The day of the John Warner Campaign visit turns into chaos. Ms. Taylor chokes on a chicken bone while Ave learns that Jack got engaged to Sweet Sue. When Ave gets home from the campaign disaster, her father's sister (Aunt Alice) is waiting, calling Ave a bastard and announcing she is taking Ave to court for the house and the pharmacy. Theodore tells Ave that he's been offered the band director's job at University of Tennessee and they should break up for multiple reasons. Ave quietly includes the fact that he likes men, to which he agrees. Jack's mom confronts Ave, desperate for her help because Sweet Sue is planning on marrying Jack within weeks. Ave collapses, suffering a nervous breakdown. Ave sleeps for days. In an act of desperation, Iva Lou has Pearl confront Jack, asking him to help bring Ave out of her sleep, telling him they are meant for each other.

Either way, the best-selling author stumbled upon the inspiration for her latest novel, The Good Left Undone, in Glasgow. She was directing the film Then Came You four years ago when she used her time off to explore the city. It ended up changing the course of her latest work, which is published in the UK on 5 May. \"I'm an Italian American, very proud Italian American and when I went to Scotland to work in 2018 I discovered that there was, in the artistic community, a lot of Scots of Italian descent - so that piqued my interest,\" she said. \"The plight of the immigrant around the world, right to this morning, is the same. \"We are seeking a better life while holding onto our traditions and you know that tradition can only thrive in a state of change.\" She stumbled across more of the story of Italian immigration during her time in Glasgow. \"When I got to Scotland I had this situation where I had a weekend free before we started filming,\" she explained. \"I wanted to get my hands in the dirt in Glasgow. \"I was by myself before we began filming and I made a list of places I wanted to go.\" She said that because she was \"no brain trust\" she started with the letter A - and St Andrew's Cathedral. \"I went there and, thrillingly, there was a wedding,\" she said. \"I crash weddings all the time. \"So, I'm taking pictures and I hear a voice behind me say: 'Who are you?' \"And I turned around and it was the priest.\" She explained that she was a tourist and he asked her name from which he quickly worked out her Italian origins. Ms Trigiani added: \"He said: 'You need to go see that garden and he pointed to this garden gate.' \"After the crowd dispersed and I got all my pictures, I went to the garden, I went through the door.\" She said she was initially struck by how modern it was, with \"shards of mirrored glass\", but its relevance was not immediately obvious. Then she walked around and saw a plinth listing the names of the victims of the sinking of the Arandora Star in 1940. The converted liner was being used to transport internees - and some German prisoners of war - to Canada when it was sunk by a torpedo from a U-boat off the Irish coast. About 100 Scots-Italians were among the more than 800 victims of the attack - the majority of whom were Italians rounded up around Britain as \"enemy aliens\" during World War 2. \"I was alone in that garden and I read the names out loud and by the time I was done I'm glad the bagpiper wasn't there because I was sobbing,\" said Ms Trigiani. \"It just broke my heart because these names are my people. \"I went back to the hotel and I called my best friend who is my researcher and I said: 'I want to hire you to research the Arandora Star for me, I've never heard of this.'\" Gradually, however, she got more information and was so moved by the story she incorporated it into The Good Left Undone. The sprawling, multi-generational tale stretches from Tuscany to France and north into Scotland and back again. Weaved into the plot is the sinking which claimed the lives of a large number of Scottish-Italians. She had started a work about gem cutters for the Vatican but incorporated the tragedy which affected so many people into her tale. Ms Trigiani said the story of the Arandora Star became the \"heartbeat\" of her novel after three years of research. However, in many ways she said she felt the immigrant story was the similar all around the world. \"They are coming in and infusing your lives, your world, your economy, your spirits,\" she said. \"It's an infusion of greatness, of new ways of doing things of new ways of eating, dining, working, creating.\" She has sprinkled some of that spirit liberally throughout her latest work.

Either way, the best-selling author stumbled upon the inspiration for her latest novel, The Good Left Undone, in Glasgow. She was directing the film Then Came You four years ago when she used her time off to explore the city. It ended up changing the course of her latest work, which is published in the UK on 5 May. \"I'm an Italian American, very proud Italian American and when I went to Scotland to work in 2018 I discovered that there was, in the artistic community, a lot of Scots of Italian descent - so that piqued my interest,\" she said. \"The plight of the immigrant around the world, right to this morning, is the same. \"We are seeking a better life while holding onto our traditions and you know that tradition can only thrive in a state of change.\" She stumbled across more of the story of Italian immigration during her time in Glasgow. \"When I got to Scotland I had this situation where I had a weekend free before we started filming,\" she explained. \"I wanted to get my hands in the dirt in Glasgow. \"I was by myself before we began filming and I made a list of places I wanted to go.\" She said that because she was \"no brain trust\" she started with the letter A - and St Andrew's Cathedral. \"I went there and, thrillingly, there was a wedding,\" she said. \"I crash weddings all the time. \"So, I'm taking pictures and I hear a voice behind me say: 'Who are you?' \"And I turned around and it was the priest.\" She explained that she was a tourist and he asked her name from which he quickly worked out her Italian origins. Ms Trigiani added: \"He said: 'You need to go see that garden and he pointed to this garden gate.' \"After the crowd dispersed and I got all my pictures, I went to the garden, I went through the door.\" She said she was initially struck by how modern it was, with \"shards of mirrored glass\", but its relevance was not immediately obvious. Then she walked around and saw a plinth listing the names of the victims of the sinking of the Arandora Star in 1940. The converted liner was being used to transport internees - and some German prisoners of war - to Canada when it was sunk by a torpedo from a U-boat off the Irish coast. About 100 Scots-Italians were among the more than 800 victims of the attack - the majority of whom were Italians rounded up around Britain as \"enemy aliens\" during World War 2. \"I was alone in that garden and I read the names out loud and by the time I was done I'm glad the bagpiper wasn't there because I was sobbing,\" said Ms Trigiani. \"It just broke my heart because these names are my people. \"I went back to the hotel and I called my best friend who is my researcher and I said: 'I want to hire you to research the Arandora Star for me, I've never heard of this.'\" Gradually, however, she got more information and was so moved by the story she incorporated it into The Good Left Undone. The sprawling, multi-generational tale stretches from Tuscany to France and north into Scotland and back again. Weaved into the plot is the sinking which claimed the lives of a large number of Scottish-Italians. She had started a work about gem cutters for the Vatican but incorporated the tragedy which affected so many people into her tale. Ms Trigiani said the story of the Arandora Star became the \"heartbeat\" of her novel after three years of research. However, in many ways she said she felt the immigrant story was the similar all around the world. \"They are coming in and infusing your lives, your world, your economy, your spirits,\" she said. \"It's an infusion of greatness, of new ways of doing things of new ways of eating, dining, working, creating.\" She has sprinkled some of that spirit liberally throughout her latest work.
