A. Applegate, and published by Scholastic. It is told in first person, with all six main characters taking turns narrating the books through their own perspectives. Horror, war, dehumanization, sanity, morality, innocence, leadership, freedom, family, and growing up are the core themes of the series. The series was originally conceived as a three-part series called The Changelings, in which Jake was named Matt, and his little brother Joseph took the place of Cassie. Published between June 1996 and May 2001, the series consists of 54 books and includes ten companion books, eight of which fit into the series' continuity (the Animorphs Chronicles and Megamorphs books) and two that are gamebooks not fitting into the continuity (the Alternamorphs books). The books were adapted into a television series of the same name on Nickelodeon, YTV and Global Television Network, which ran from 1998 to 1999. The series has also been adapted to audiobook form as well as a series of graphic novels starting in 2020. A film adaptation was announced in September 2015. The story revolves around five humans: Jake, Marco, Cassie, Rachel and Tobias, and one alien, Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill (nicknamed Ax), who obtain the ability to transform into any animal they touch. Naming themselves \"Animorphs\" (a portmanteau of \"animal morphers\"), they use their ability to battle a secret alien infiltration of Earth by a parasitic race of aliens resembling large slugs called Yeerks, that can take any living creatures as a host by entering and merging with their brain through the ear canal. The Animorphs fight as a guerilla force against the Yeerks who are led by Visser Three. Throughout the series, the Animorphs carefully protect their identities; the Yeerks assume that the Animorphs are a strike force sent by the Andalites, the alien race to which Ax belongs that created the transformation technology, to prevent them from conquering Earth. To protect their families from Yeerk reprisals, the Animorphs maintain this fa\u00e7ade. Though the Animorphs can assume the form of any animal they touch to acquire the DNA, there are several limitations to the ability. The most vital is that they cannot stay in animal form for more than two hours, or they will be unable to return to human form and the morphs become permanent. Others include having to de-morph back to human in between morphs, only tight clothing being able to be carried over with a morph, DNA allergies that can lose some control of the morphing ability, and having to consistently maintain concentration during a morph to prevent the animal's natural instincts from overwhelming their human intellect. A benefit to morphing is that it allows the team to heal any superficial, non-genetic injury, sustained as a human or in a morph. Also, while in morph, they can telepathically communicate with anyone nearby in what they call 'thought-speak'. In an interview with Publishers Weekly, Applegate talked about the source of inspiration and realization for the Animorphs series: \"I grew up loving animals and lived with the usual suburban menagerie of dogs, cats and gerbils\", she said \"I really wanted to find a way to get kids into the heads of various species and decided that a science-fiction premise was the way to do this\". Applegate tried to accurately depict the various animals, and did research such as visiting \"a raptor center where they rehabilitate injured birds\". \"When Tobias becomes a hawk, I want the reader to see the world as a hawk might see it\u2014to soar on the warm breezes and hurtle toward the ground to make a kill\", she said. To develop the characters for Animorphs, Applegate would go through teenage magazines such as YM and Seventeen (both of which are referenced in the books when describing Rachel), cutting out pictures and piecing them together to get an idea of what sort of children the Animorphs would look like. Applegate stated in an interview online that many of the names for her alien creatures, races, and locations are actually scrambled names of local street signs or companies that she happens to notice. For instance, the word nothlit was derived from the hotel name Hilton. In another interview, Applegate stated that she originally wanted the alien Andalite to have more standard and familiar forms, but was told by Scholastic to be more creative with the designs, which led to her giving them such distinctive look. According to the Anibase, Applegate did not make up the titles for the Animorphs books: it was up to the Scholastic editors to create the titles for the books based on the outlines provided by the author, having to select a word that not only fit the\n\nquestion: Who is the author of the Animorphs series?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Katherine Applegate and her husband Michael Grant", "usage": 1126}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

One of the author's favorite books, The Lord of the Rings, lent several words and images to Animorphs: the Sindarin plural word for Orc, \"yrch\", became Yeerk; the flaming red Eye of Sauron inspired the Crayak, and Ax's middle name, \"Esgarrouth\", is based on a town in the books called Esgaroth. The human name of Ax's brother, Elfangor, is Alan Fangor and his last name is in reference to the Fangor region or Fangorn Forest. Also there was a minor reference to Gondor, in the form of a fictional company named \"Gondor Industries\" in the 14th book. Applegate's writing was inspired by her family. All books after The Unknown were dedicated to Applegate's first daughter, Clara, under her former name, as well as Applegate's husband and co-writer, Michael. Her daughter was born premature in 1997, and Applegate worked on the Animorphs series at night, in the lobby of the hospital where she was in Neonatal Intensive Care (NIC). Each book in the series revolved around a given event during the war waged between the Animorphs and the invading Yeerks. Within a year and a half after the first book was published, the series had close to ten million copies in print, with Scholastic claiming a \"stronger initial sell-in\" than any of its other series up to that time. The series debut was preceded by a large marketing campaign which included posters on buildings, giveaway items in bookstores, and ads on Nickelodeon TV. In the United States, the books were most popular as A5-sized paperback volumes, and were usually between 150 and 200 pages long, divided into just under thirty chapters. The front covers featured images of the narrating Animorph undergoing the various stages of one of the morphs from the story, with a few exceptions (noted in each book's article). Behind the morphing character were images of clouds and skies, which became more colorful and elaborate as the series progressed. All the covers of the regular series books had a small cutout over part of the full morph's anatomy, revealing a computer-generated illustration on the first page, which was printed on glossy paper. The illustration shared the image of the full morph with the front cover, but placed within an environment from the story. The book spines repeated the narrating character's face from the front cover, and the spine color changed with every new episode, resulting in a very colorful collection when viewed from any angle. A small excerpt from one of the book's chapters was printed on the inside of every front cover. As of the eighth book, The Alien, the Animorphs logo, the author's name, and the book's title were printed in glossy, metallic-look ink, rather than the flat colors that had been used for the first seven books. In addition, the author's name and book title were surrounded by solid black rectangles. The majority of the books in the series were printed only in \"metallic-ink editions\". All further reprintings of the first seven books had this treatment applied to them as well. The books in the series' final arc, beginning with the 45th book, The Revelation had yet another treatment applied to the cover, a variation on the new metallic style; the change affected only the main 'Animorphs' logo: instead of consisting of white letters superimposed on a metallic, colored background, the last ten books featured a logo with colored letters over a dark grey background, in contrast with the white logo background from the series' \"opening arc\". The final book, #54 The Beginning had a unique cover style, with the logo consisting of a glowing outline. Every book featured an introduction to the series on the back cover, in the voice of Jake, one of the Animorphs. We can't tell you who we are. Or where we live. It's too risky, and we've got to be careful. Really careful. So we don't trust anyone. Because if they find us... well, we just won't let them find us. The thing you should know is that everyone is in really big trouble. Yeah. Even you. As of book 51, The Absolute, the introduction read as follows: Here's the deal these days: They know exactly who we are. They know exactly where we live. We've got a few secrets left, and we're gonna use them. But just know that the end is coming. And we don't know how much longer we can do this. How much longer can we fight. What about you? Where will you be when it ends? Think about it. Think hard. Because the countdown has already begun... In addition to this text, each book also carried an introduction, or teaser, to its own storyline. Another feature of the books was a flipbook composed of\n\nquestion: Who is the author of the Animorphs series?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Katherine Alice Applegate", "usage": 1122}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A step of the cover morph was printed on each page, less than an inch tall, in black-and-white. When the pages were flipped from front to back, the narrating Animorph could be seen morphing into the animal. The Animorphs series was printed in over twenty-five languages and other English-language markets, and the books in those countries sometimes had different designs, layouts, cover quotes, and even different cover morphs, as is the case for the fifth book, The Predator, whose UK edition showed Marco morphing into a lobster, in contrast to the American edition's gorilla morph. Japanese-language covers were hand-drawn; The Invasion showed Jake morphing into his dog Homer, a morph that was featured on the cover of The Threat in the American editions. Gallimard Jeunesse is the French publisher and Tammi is the Finnish publisher. The German publisher, Ravensburger, has also published some of the volumes as audio plays. In 2010, Scholastic announced plans to re-release the series with new lenticular covers and updated pop culture references. The re-release lasted from May 2011 to September 2012, ending after #8: The Alien due to tepid sales. The series consists of 54 books and includes ten companion books, eight of which fit into the series' continuity (the Animorphs Chronicles and Megamorphs books) and two that are gamebooks not fitting into the continuity (the Alternamorphs books). Many of the novels from the #25-#52 range were written by ghostwriters. Typically, K. A. Applegate would write a detailed outline for each book, and a ghostwriter, usually one of Applegate's former editors or writing prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, would spend a month or two writing the actual novel. After this, Applegate, and later her series editor, Tonya Alicia Martin, would edit the book to make it fit in with the series' tight continuity. Ghostwriters are credited for their help in the book's dedication page: \"The author would like to thank  for his/her help in preparing this manuscript\". The only books in this range fully written by Applegate herself after #26: The Attack are #32: The Separation, #53: The Answer, #54: The Beginning and all of the Megamorphs and Chronicles books. The following books in the series were ghostwritten: Applegate originally intended to write every Animorphs book herself. However, due to many contributing factors\u2014such as the birth of her child and the difficulties involved in writing Everworld (which was originally intended to be mostly ghostwritten, like Applegate's third Scholastic series Remnants), she ended up having a large number of the books ghostwritten. The Animorphs toy line was introduced in 1999 by Hasbro. They were marketed as part of the Transformers series, despite there being no in-universe connection between the two franchises. However, the Animorphs toys were commercially unsuccessful and the toy line was soon cancelled. After the cancellation, several toys planned to be part of the Animorphs line were slightly remodeled and released as part of the Beast Wars Mutants line. A television series of the same name ran from September 1998 to March 2000 in the United States and Canada. Animorphs comprised 26 episodes over two seasons, which aired on YTV (first season) and Global (second season) in Canada and Nickelodeon in the United States. In September 2015, several film websites began reporting rumors that Universal Pictures had plans to adapt the book series into a film, based on a report by the film website The Tracking Board. The site also claimed that Universal would be working with Silvertongue Films, a production house launched to develop Scholastic books into feature films, and that Deborah Forte would be producing. In June 2020, it was formally announced that an Animorphs film would be produced by Scholastic Entertainment, and Picturestart, the latter run by Erik Feig and Lucy Kitada. Script development will be overseen by Caitlin Friedman and Royce Reeves Darby. Animorphs authors Katherine Applegate and Michael Grant initially agreed to collaborate on the project, but in October 2020 Grant announced via Twitter that he and Applegate would not be a part of the film's production, citing \"creative differences\". Grant later clarified his remark, wishing the producers the best and noting he and Applegate simply weren't being involved enough in the production process.

In 2020 Scholastic Audio began releasing an uncut audio version of the series on Audible. Books 1 and 2 were released on January 7, 2020, with subsequent releases on the first or second Tuesday of each month for 5 months. There was a brief hiatus, then books 11 and 12 were released on January 26, 2021, following the same pattern. After another hiatus 21 and 22 were released on November 8, 2021, following the same way. Since June 2022, Books 31 and on have been released on the first Tuesday of every month. Six narrators are used, one for each of the main characters. MacLeod Andrews narrates Jake (and Elfangor, for The Andalite Chronicles), Emily Ellet for Rachel, Michael Crouch for Tobias, Sisi Aisha Johnson for Cassie, Ram\u00f3n de Ocampo for Marco, and Adam Verner for Ax. Mark Bramhall narrates as Jake's Civil War ancestor Isaiah Fitzhenry for parts of book #47, The Resistance. Scholastic announced plans to launch a graphic novel adaptation of Animorphs via its Scholastic Graphix imprint. The first release, adapting The Invasion, was released on October 6, 2020, with art by Eisner-Award nominee Chris Grine. The second novel, adapting The Visitor, was released on October 5, 2021. The third novel, adapting The Encounter, was released on October 4, 2022. The fourth novel, adapting The Message, according to Amazon, will be released on December 5, 2023.\n\nquestion: Who is the author of the Animorphs series?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "K.A.

These novels tell more subtle stories, where the line between human and other blurs Say the words \u201calien invasion\u201d and the stories most people think of are those told in movies like Roland Emmerich\u2019s Independence Day (1996), in which the battle lines between good and evil are cleanly divided. HG Wells dreamed up this template in 1897, with Martian invaders laying waste the home counties in The War of the Worlds. Half a century later, John Wyndham\u2019s The Kraken Wakes (1953) envisaged the melting of the ice caps not as the by-product of human negligence but as the result of a hostile intervention by alien forces. In writing my novel Conquest, I was determined to subvert these violent stereotypes. What I find most compelling about earlier alien invasion narratives is the way they highlight how vulnerable we are, not to aliens so much as our own irrational behaviour in the face of the unknown. I wanted to reveal the theme of alien invasion as infinitely flexible, adapting itself to subtle, ambiguous stories in which the divide between human and alien is not always clear cut. My protagonist Frank Landau stands in permanent danger of losing his sanity to his obsessions. And yet Frank has a brilliant mind; in many ways, he is the most sensitive and compassionate individual in the novel. The tension between these two truths is the engine that drives Conquest, and it is this irreconcilable contradiction between delusion and epiphany I find most fascinating in other alien invasion stories. Here are 10 of my favourites: 1. Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeerVandermeer\u2019s Southern Reach trilogy charts the exploration of alien incursions in a remote, segregated area of wilderness that keeps expanding. The scientists who venture into Area X find it impossible to communicate the reality of their experiences there, a failure of language that makes the encounter all the more traumatic. 2. How High We Go in the Dark by Sequoia NagamatsuThe alien presence in this book was on Earth all the time: a prehistoric virus, released from melting permafrost as the result of climate change. Nagamatsu\u2019s subtle, heartfelt novel is constructed as a series of linked stories, beginning with the discovery of the virus and moving forward through time to reveal a world irrevocably altered by the resulting pandemic, and not always for the worse. 3. The Book of Strange New Things by Michel FaberIn Faber\u2019s novel, we are the invading aliens, and the book\u2019s protagonist, Peter Leigh, travels to the planet Oasis as a Christian missionary. His wife, Bea, is left behind on an Earth that is becoming increasingly divided through social upheavals resulting from climate change. Faber\u2019s vision is bleak, alienating, even frightening, but there is redemption here too. This novel\u2019s strange, hypnotic power poses questions that linger long after reading. 4. Agents of Dreamland by Caitl\u00edn R KiernanThe first in a trilogy of taut novellas that combine the bitter essence of noir with the cosmic terror of Lovecraft, Agents of Dreamland recounts the secret history of shadowy operatives who wrestle, like angels and demons, for the soul and continuing existence of the human race. The battle takes place in a world grown stale and grubby from government corruption, where consensus reality is steadily becoming eroded. Kiernan\u2019s language and manner of telling manages to be both lyrical and sharp as thorns. 5. Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris StrugatskyAt some point in the recent past, aliens visited Earth. They left no trace, other than the curiously altered \u201czones\u201d littered with mysterious relics, some wondrous, some deadly. These objects have no apparent purpose, but exert a powerful influence on all who encounter them. Red Schuhart is a \u201cstalker\u201d, earning a perilous living guiding fortune-hunters and thrill-seekers through the zone. This book \u2013 translated from the Russian by Antonina W Bouis \u2013 is harsh, tender, magical and, like all Soviet science fiction, full of double meanings. 6. XX by Rian HughesA radio telescope at Jodrell Bank has picked up a signal believed to be of extra-terrestrial origin. Jack Fenwick, an expert in the developing science of artificial intelligence, is tasked with interpreting the signal and locating its source. The plotline of XX could be straight out of Fred Hoyle or Arthur C Clarke. But there the similarity ends, for Hughes, a comic book artist and designer of typefaces, knows science fiction well enough to push its boundaries. Hughes\u2019s central interest lies with text itself, and how it might be manipulated to alter the reader\u2019s perception of reality. To read XX is to glimpse the alien first-hand, if only from the corner of your eye. 7.

Their reality becomes gradually destabilised as each comes to suspect that they are witnessing the dawn of a new world order. Being characters in a Harrison narrative, their reaction to the catastrophe is somewhat muted. If you are not already a Harrison reader, this novel \u2013 as acute a portrait as any of the way we live now \u2013 is the place to start. 8. The Employees by Olga RavnThis unfolds as a series of individual reports filed by crew members, both human and AI, working aboard an interdimensional spacecraft. The crew has been entrusted with the care of a number of alien artefacts, strange objects that might almost have come from the zone in Roadside Picnic. As their mysterious journey continues, the employees begin to experience altered states, hallucinations and separation anxiety, seemingly as a direct result of their contact with the alien. This exquisitely strange short novel, translated from the Danish by Martin Aitken, began life as the textual accompaniment to an art installation by Danish artist Lea Guldditte Hestelund. Its mission: to investigate the nature of being human. 9. Lagoon by Nnedi OkoraforWith its jump cuts and tessellations, Okorafor\u2019s playful, almost filmic account of an alien expedition to the city of Lagos feels unlike any alien invasion story you might have read before. Science fiction cohabits with fantasy to produce a vigorous, gorgeous mutation teeming with deft postmodernist touches: chapters told from non-human points of view, snapshots of reportage, moments when Okorafor breaks the fourth wall to ask how readers might have reacted had they been there. A joyously experimental text, Lagoon shimmers with the delirium and chaos that might be expected from an alien visit. 10. Story of Your Life by Ted ChiangChiang\u2019s 1999 novella is one of the most subtle and life-affirming explorations of language, time and perception to be found in all of science fiction. Linguist Louise Banks is attempting to unravel the seemingly insoluble mystery of how to communicate with the alien \u201cheptapods\u201d that have landed on Earth. At the same time, she is trying to come to terms with the death of her daughter. As with all Chiang\u2019s fiction, the story unfolds through pursuing a deeper understanding of a stated reality, in this instance an entirely alien language that seems to have no human equivalent. Denis Villeneuve\u2019s 2016 film adaptation Arrival is a fine piece of work, but Chiang\u2019s original story is even better, engaging the emotions and the intellect with equal force.

The story revolves around five humans: Jake, Marco, Cassie, Rachel and Tobias, and one alien, Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill (nicknamed Ax), who obtain the ability to transform into any animal they touch. Naming themselves \"Animorphs\" (a portmanteau of \"animal morphers\"), they use their ability to battle a secret alien infiltration of Earth by a parasitic race of aliens resembling large slugs called Yeerks, that can take any living creatures as a host by entering and merging with their brain through the ear canal. The Animorphs fight as a guerilla force against the Yeerks who are led by Visser Three. Throughout the series, the Animorphs carefully protect their identities; the Yeerks assume that the Animorphs are a strike force sent by the Andalites, the alien race to which Ax belongs that created the transformation technology, to prevent them from conquering Earth.

A benefit to morphing is that it allows the team to heal any superficial, non-genetic injury, sustained as a human or in a morph.

To develop the characters for Animorphs, Applegate would go through teenage magazines such as YM and Seventeen (both of which are referenced in the books when describing Rachel), cutting out pictures and piecing them together to get an idea of what sort of children the Animorphs would look like. Applegate stated in an interview online that many of the names for her alien creatures, races, and locations are actually scrambled names of local street signs or companies that she happens to notice. For instance, the word nothlit was derived from the hotel name Hilton. In another interview, Applegate stated that she originally wanted the alien Andalite to have more standard and familiar forms, but was told by Scholastic to be more creative with the designs, which led to her giving them such distinctive look. According to the Anibase, Applegate did not make up the titles for the Animorphs books: it was up to the Scholastic editors to create the titles for the books based on the outlines provided by the author, having to select a word that not only fit the\n\nquestion: What is the premise of the series?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The premise of the series is that a group of five humans and one alien obtain the ability to transform into any animal they touch.

One of the author's favorite books, The Lord of the Rings, lent several words and images to Animorphs: the Sindarin plural word for Orc, \"yrch\", became Yeerk; the flaming red Eye of Sauron inspired the Crayak, and Ax's middle name, \"Esgarrouth\", is based on a town in the books called Esgaroth. The human name of Ax's brother, Elfangor, is Alan Fangor and his last name is in reference to the Fangor region or Fangorn Forest. Also there was a minor reference to Gondor, in the form of a fictional company named \"Gondor Industries\" in the 14th book. Applegate's writing was inspired by her family. All books after The Unknown were dedicated to Applegate's first daughter, Clara, under her former name, as well as Applegate's husband and co-writer, Michael. Her daughter was born premature in 1997, and Applegate worked on the Animorphs series at night, in the lobby of the hospital where she was in Neonatal Intensive Care (NIC). Each book in the series revolved around a given event during the war waged between the Animorphs and the invading Yeerks. Within a year and a half after the first book was published, the series had close to ten million copies in print, with Scholastic claiming a \"stronger initial sell-in\" than any of its other series up to that time. The series debut was preceded by a large marketing campaign which included posters on buildings, giveaway items in bookstores, and ads on Nickelodeon TV. In the United States, the books were most popular as A5-sized paperback volumes, and were usually between 150 and 200 pages long, divided into just under thirty chapters. The front covers featured images of the narrating Animorph undergoing the various stages of one of the morphs from the story, with a few exceptions (noted in each book's article). Behind the morphing character were images of clouds and skies, which became more colorful and elaborate as the series progressed. All the covers of the regular series books had a small cutout over part of the full morph's anatomy, revealing a computer-generated illustration on the first page, which was printed on glossy paper. The illustration shared the image of the full morph with the front cover, but placed within an environment from the story. The book spines repeated the narrating character's face from the front cover, and the spine color changed with every new episode, resulting in a very colorful collection when viewed from any angle. A small excerpt from one of the book's chapters was printed on the inside of every front cover. As of the eighth book, The Alien, the Animorphs logo, the author's name, and the book's title were printed in glossy, metallic-look ink, rather than the flat colors that had been used for the first seven books. In addition, the author's name and book title were surrounded by solid black rectangles. The majority of the books in the series were printed only in \"metallic-ink editions\". All further reprintings of the first seven books had this treatment applied to them as well. The books in the series' final arc, beginning with the 45th book, The Revelation had yet another treatment applied to the cover, a variation on the new metallic style; the change affected only the main 'Animorphs' logo: instead of consisting of white letters superimposed on a metallic, colored background, the last ten books featured a logo with colored letters over a dark grey background, in contrast with the white logo background from the series' \"opening arc\". The final book, #54 The Beginning had a unique cover style, with the logo consisting of a glowing outline. Every book featured an introduction to the series on the back cover, in the voice of Jake, one of the Animorphs. We can't tell you who we are. Or where we live. It's too risky, and we've got to be careful. Really careful. So we don't trust anyone. Because if they find us... well, we just won't let them find us. The thing you should know is that everyone is in really big trouble. Yeah. Even you. As of book 51, The Absolute, the introduction read as follows: Here's the deal these days: They know exactly who we are. They know exactly where we live. We've got a few secrets left, and we're gonna use them. But just know that the end is coming. And we don't know how much longer we can do this. How much longer can we fight. What about you? Where will you be when it ends? Think about it. Think hard. Because the countdown has already begun... In addition to this text, each book also carried an introduction, or teaser, to its own storyline.

A step of the cover morph was printed on each page, less than an inch tall, in black-and-white. When the pages were flipped from front to back, the narrating Animorph could be seen morphing into the animal. The Animorphs series was printed in over twenty-five languages and other English-language markets, and the books in those countries sometimes had different designs, layouts, cover quotes, and even different cover morphs, as is the case for the fifth book, The Predator, whose UK edition showed Marco morphing into a lobster, in contrast to the American edition's gorilla morph. Japanese-language covers were hand-drawn; The Invasion showed Jake morphing into his dog Homer, a morph that was featured on the cover of The Threat in the American editions. Gallimard Jeunesse is the French publisher and Tammi is the Finnish publisher. The German publisher, Ravensburger, has also published some of the volumes as audio plays. In 2010, Scholastic announced plans to re-release the series with new lenticular covers and updated pop culture references. The re-release lasted from May 2011 to September 2012, ending after #8: The Alien due to tepid sales. The series consists of 54 books and includes ten companion books, eight of which fit into the series' continuity (the Animorphs Chronicles and Megamorphs books) and two that are gamebooks not fitting into the continuity (the Alternamorphs books). Many of the novels from the #25-#52 range were written by ghostwriters. Typically, K. A. Applegate would write a detailed outline for each book, and a ghostwriter, usually one of Applegate's former editors or writing prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, would spend a month or two writing the actual novel. After this, Applegate, and later her series editor, Tonya Alicia Martin, would edit the book to make it fit in with the series' tight continuity. Ghostwriters are credited for their help in the book's dedication page: \"The author would like to thank  for his/her help in preparing this manuscript\". The only books in this range fully written by Applegate herself after #26: The Attack are #32: The Separation, #53: The Answer, #54: The Beginning and all of the Megamorphs and Chronicles books. The following books in the series were ghostwritten: Applegate originally intended to write every Animorphs book herself. However, due to many contributing factors\u2014such as the birth of her child and the difficulties involved in writing Everworld (which was originally intended to be mostly ghostwritten, like Applegate's third Scholastic series Remnants), she ended up having a large number of the books ghostwritten. The Animorphs toy line was introduced in 1999 by Hasbro. They were marketed as part of the Transformers series, despite there being no in-universe connection between the two franchises. However, the Animorphs toys were commercially unsuccessful and the toy line was soon cancelled. After the cancellation, several toys planned to be part of the Animorphs line were slightly remodeled and released as part of the Beast Wars Mutants line. A television series of the same name ran from September 1998 to March 2000 in the United States and Canada. Animorphs comprised 26 episodes over two seasons, which aired on YTV (first season) and Global (second season) in Canada and Nickelodeon in the United States. In September 2015, several film websites began reporting rumors that Universal Pictures had plans to adapt the book series into a film, based on a report by the film website The Tracking Board. The site also claimed that Universal would be working with Silvertongue Films, a production house launched to develop Scholastic books into feature films, and that Deborah Forte would be producing. In June 2020, it was formally announced that an Animorphs film would be produced by Scholastic Entertainment, and Picturestart, the latter run by Erik Feig and Lucy Kitada. Script development will be overseen by Caitlin Friedman and Royce Reeves Darby. Animorphs authors Katherine Applegate and Michael Grant initially agreed to collaborate on the project, but in October 2020 Grant announced via Twitter that he and Applegate would not be a part of the film's production, citing \"creative differences\". Grant later clarified his remark, wishing the producers the best and noting he and Applegate simply weren't being involved enough in the production process.

Developed by Gigawatt Studios and published by Infogrames, it lets the player to switch control between four of the Animorphs (Cassie, Jake, Marco and Rachel).

In 2020 Scholastic Audio began releasing an uncut audio version of the series on Audible. Books 1 and 2 were released on January 7, 2020, with subsequent releases on the first or second Tuesday of each month for 5 months. There was a brief hiatus, then books 11 and 12 were released on January 26, 2021, following the same pattern. After another hiatus 21 and 22 were released on November 8, 2021, following the same way. Since June 2022, Books 31 and on have been released on the first Tuesday of every month. Six narrators are used, one for each of the main characters. MacLeod Andrews narrates Jake (and Elfangor, for The Andalite Chronicles), Emily Ellet for Rachel, Michael Crouch for Tobias, Sisi Aisha Johnson for Cassie, Ram\u00f3n de Ocampo for Marco, and Adam Verner for Ax. Mark Bramhall narrates as Jake's Civil War ancestor Isaiah Fitzhenry for parts of book #47, The Resistance. Scholastic announced plans to launch a graphic novel adaptation of Animorphs via its Scholastic Graphix imprint. The first release, adapting The Invasion, was released on October 6, 2020, with art by Eisner-Award nominee Chris Grine. The second novel, adapting The Visitor, was released on October 5, 2021. The third novel, adapting The Encounter, was released on October 4, 2022. The fourth novel, adapting The Message, according to Amazon, will be released on December 5, 2023.\n\nquestion: What is the premise of the series?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Animorphs series revolves around four of the Animorphs trying to find pieces of the Continuum Crystal before Visser Three does.", "usage": 521}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

These novels tell more subtle stories, where the line between human and other blurs Say the words \u201calien invasion\u201d and the stories most people think of are those told in movies like Roland Emmerich\u2019s Independence Day (1996), in which the battle lines between good and evil are cleanly divided. HG Wells dreamed up this template in 1897, with Martian invaders laying waste the home counties in The War of the Worlds. Half a century later, John Wyndham\u2019s The Kraken Wakes (1953) envisaged the melting of the ice caps not as the by-product of human negligence but as the result of a hostile intervention by alien forces. In writing my novel Conquest, I was determined to subvert these violent stereotypes. What I find most compelling about earlier alien invasion narratives is the way they highlight how vulnerable we are, not to aliens so much as our own irrational behaviour in the face of the unknown. I wanted to reveal the theme of alien invasion as infinitely flexible, adapting itself to subtle, ambiguous stories in which the divide between human and alien is not always clear cut. My protagonist Frank Landau stands in permanent danger of losing his sanity to his obsessions. And yet Frank has a brilliant mind; in many ways, he is the most sensitive and compassionate individual in the novel. The tension between these two truths is the engine that drives Conquest, and it is this irreconcilable contradiction between delusion and epiphany I find most fascinating in other alien invasion stories. Here are 10 of my favourites: 1. Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeerVandermeer\u2019s Southern Reach trilogy charts the exploration of alien incursions in a remote, segregated area of wilderness that keeps expanding. The scientists who venture into Area X find it impossible to communicate the reality of their experiences there, a failure of language that makes the encounter all the more traumatic. 2. How High We Go in the Dark by Sequoia NagamatsuThe alien presence in this book was on Earth all the time: a prehistoric virus, released from melting permafrost as the result of climate change. Nagamatsu\u2019s subtle, heartfelt novel is constructed as a series of linked stories, beginning with the discovery of the virus and moving forward through time to reveal a world irrevocably altered by the resulting pandemic, and not always for the worse. 3. The Book of Strange New Things by Michel FaberIn Faber\u2019s novel, we are the invading aliens, and the book\u2019s protagonist, Peter Leigh, travels to the planet Oasis as a Christian missionary. His wife, Bea, is left behind on an Earth that is becoming increasingly divided through social upheavals resulting from climate change. Faber\u2019s vision is bleak, alienating, even frightening, but there is redemption here too. This novel\u2019s strange, hypnotic power poses questions that linger long after reading. 4. Agents of Dreamland by Caitl\u00edn R KiernanThe first in a trilogy of taut novellas that combine the bitter essence of noir with the cosmic terror of Lovecraft, Agents of Dreamland recounts the secret history of shadowy operatives who wrestle, like angels and demons, for the soul and continuing existence of the human race. The battle takes place in a world grown stale and grubby from government corruption, where consensus reality is steadily becoming eroded. Kiernan\u2019s language and manner of telling manages to be both lyrical and sharp as thorns. 5. Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris StrugatskyAt some point in the recent past, aliens visited Earth. They left no trace, other than the curiously altered \u201czones\u201d littered with mysterious relics, some wondrous, some deadly. These objects have no apparent purpose, but exert a powerful influence on all who encounter them. Red Schuhart is a \u201cstalker\u201d, earning a perilous living guiding fortune-hunters and thrill-seekers through the zone. This book \u2013 translated from the Russian by Antonina W Bouis \u2013 is harsh, tender, magical and, like all Soviet science fiction, full of double meanings. 6. XX by Rian HughesA radio telescope at Jodrell Bank has picked up a signal believed to be of extra-terrestrial origin. Jack Fenwick, an expert in the developing science of artificial intelligence, is tasked with interpreting the signal and locating its source. The plotline of XX could be straight out of Fred Hoyle or Arthur C Clarke. But there the similarity ends, for Hughes, a comic book artist and designer of typefaces, knows science fiction well enough to push its boundaries. Hughes\u2019s central interest lies with text itself, and how it might be manipulated to alter the reader\u2019s perception of reality. To read XX is to glimpse the alien first-hand, if only from the corner of your eye. 7.

Their reality becomes gradually destabilised as each comes to suspect that they are witnessing the dawn of a new world order. Being characters in a Harrison narrative, their reaction to the catastrophe is somewhat muted. If you are not already a Harrison reader, this novel \u2013 as acute a portrait as any of the way we live now \u2013 is the place to start. 8. The Employees by Olga RavnThis unfolds as a series of individual reports filed by crew members, both human and AI, working aboard an interdimensional spacecraft. The crew has been entrusted with the care of a number of alien artefacts, strange objects that might almost have come from the zone in Roadside Picnic. As their mysterious journey continues, the employees begin to experience altered states, hallucinations and separation anxiety, seemingly as a direct result of their contact with the alien. This exquisitely strange short novel, translated from the Danish by Martin Aitken, began life as the textual accompaniment to an art installation by Danish artist Lea Guldditte Hestelund. Its mission: to investigate the nature of being human. 9. Lagoon by Nnedi OkoraforWith its jump cuts and tessellations, Okorafor\u2019s playful, almost filmic account of an alien expedition to the city of Lagos feels unlike any alien invasion story you might have read before. Science fiction cohabits with fantasy to produce a vigorous, gorgeous mutation teeming with deft postmodernist touches: chapters told from non-human points of view, snapshots of reportage, moments when Okorafor breaks the fourth wall to ask how readers might have reacted had they been there. A joyously experimental text, Lagoon shimmers with the delirium and chaos that might be expected from an alien visit. 10. Story of Your Life by Ted ChiangChiang\u2019s 1999 novella is one of the most subtle and life-affirming explorations of language, time and perception to be found in all of science fiction. Linguist Louise Banks is attempting to unravel the seemingly insoluble mystery of how to communicate with the alien \u201cheptapods\u201d that have landed on Earth. At the same time, she is trying to come to terms with the death of her daughter. As with all Chiang\u2019s fiction, the story unfolds through pursuing a deeper understanding of a stated reality, in this instance an entirely alien language that seems to have no human equivalent. Denis Villeneuve\u2019s 2016 film adaptation Arrival is a fine piece of work, but Chiang\u2019s original story is even better, engaging the emotions and the intellect with equal force.

A. Applegate, and published by Scholastic. It is told in first person, with all six main characters taking turns narrating the books through their own perspectives. Horror, war, dehumanization, sanity, morality, innocence, leadership, freedom, family, and growing up are the core themes of the series. The series was originally conceived as a three-part series called The Changelings, in which Jake was named Matt, and his little brother Joseph took the place of Cassie. Published between June 1996 and May 2001, the series consists of 54 books and includes ten companion books, eight of which fit into the series' continuity (the Animorphs Chronicles and Megamorphs books) and two that are gamebooks not fitting into the continuity (the Alternamorphs books). The books were adapted into a television series of the same name on Nickelodeon, YTV and Global Television Network, which ran from 1998 to 1999. The series has also been adapted to audiobook form as well as a series of graphic novels starting in 2020. A film adaptation was announced in September 2015. The story revolves around five humans: Jake, Marco, Cassie, Rachel and Tobias, and one alien, Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill (nicknamed Ax), who obtain the ability to transform into any animal they touch. Naming themselves \"Animorphs\" (a portmanteau of \"animal morphers\"), they use their ability to battle a secret alien infiltration of Earth by a parasitic race of aliens resembling large slugs called Yeerks, that can take any living creatures as a host by entering and merging with their brain through the ear canal. The Animorphs fight as a guerilla force against the Yeerks who are led by Visser Three. Throughout the series, the Animorphs carefully protect their identities; the Yeerks assume that the Animorphs are a strike force sent by the Andalites, the alien race to which Ax belongs that created the transformation technology, to prevent them from conquering Earth. To protect their families from Yeerk reprisals, the Animorphs maintain this fa\u00e7ade. Though the Animorphs can assume the form of any animal they touch to acquire the DNA, there are several limitations to the ability. The most vital is that they cannot stay in animal form for more than two hours, or they will be unable to return to human form and the morphs become permanent. Others include having to de-morph back to human in between morphs, only tight clothing being able to be carried over with a morph, DNA allergies that can lose some control of the morphing ability, and having to consistently maintain concentration during a morph to prevent the animal's natural instincts from overwhelming their human intellect. A benefit to morphing is that it allows the team to heal any superficial, non-genetic injury, sustained as a human or in a morph. Also, while in morph, they can telepathically communicate with anyone nearby in what they call 'thought-speak'. In an interview with Publishers Weekly, Applegate talked about the source of inspiration and realization for the Animorphs series: \"I grew up loving animals and lived with the usual suburban menagerie of dogs, cats and gerbils\", she said \"I really wanted to find a way to get kids into the heads of various species and decided that a science-fiction premise was the way to do this\". Applegate tried to accurately depict the various animals, and did research such as visiting \"a raptor center where they rehabilitate injured birds\". \"When Tobias becomes a hawk, I want the reader to see the world as a hawk might see it\u2014to soar on the warm breezes and hurtle toward the ground to make a kill\", she said.

A step of the cover morph was printed on each page, less than an inch tall, in black-and-white. When the pages were flipped from front to back, the narrating Animorph could be seen morphing into the animal. The Animorphs series was printed in over twenty-five languages and other English-language markets, and the books in those countries sometimes had different designs, layouts, cover quotes, and even different cover morphs, as is the case for the fifth book, The Predator, whose UK edition showed Marco morphing into a lobster, in contrast to the American edition's gorilla morph. Japanese-language covers were hand-drawn; The Invasion showed Jake morphing into his dog Homer, a morph that was featured on the cover of The Threat in the American editions. Gallimard Jeunesse is the French publisher and Tammi is the Finnish publisher. The German publisher, Ravensburger, has also published some of the volumes as audio plays. In 2010, Scholastic announced plans to re-release the series with new lenticular covers and updated pop culture references. The re-release lasted from May 2011 to September 2012, ending after #8: The Alien due to tepid sales. The series consists of 54 books and includes ten companion books, eight of which fit into the series' continuity (the Animorphs Chronicles and Megamorphs books) and two that are gamebooks not fitting into the continuity (the Alternamorphs books). Many of the novels from the #25-#52 range were written by ghostwriters. Typically, K. A. Applegate would write a detailed outline for each book, and a ghostwriter, usually one of Applegate's former editors or writing prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, would spend a month or two writing the actual novel. After this, Applegate, and later her series editor, Tonya Alicia Martin, would edit the book to make it fit in with the series' tight continuity. Ghostwriters are credited for their help in the book's dedication page: \"The author would like to thank  for his/her help in preparing this manuscript\". The only books in this range fully written by Applegate herself after #26: The Attack are #32: The Separation, #53: The Answer, #54: The Beginning and all of the Megamorphs and Chronicles books. The following books in the series were ghostwritten: Applegate originally intended to write every Animorphs book herself. However, due to many contributing factors\u2014such as the birth of her child and the difficulties involved in writing Everworld (which was originally intended to be mostly ghostwritten, like Applegate's third Scholastic series Remnants), she ended up having a large number of the books ghostwritten. The Animorphs toy line was introduced in 1999 by Hasbro. They were marketed as part of the Transformers series, despite there being no in-universe connection between the two franchises. However, the Animorphs toys were commercially unsuccessful and the toy line was soon cancelled. After the cancellation, several toys planned to be part of the Animorphs line were slightly remodeled and released as part of the Beast Wars Mutants line. A television series of the same name ran from September 1998 to March 2000 in the United States and Canada. Animorphs comprised 26 episodes over two seasons, which aired on YTV (first season) and Global (second season) in Canada and Nickelodeon in the United States. In September 2015, several film websites began reporting rumors that Universal Pictures had plans to adapt the book series into a film, based on a report by the film website The Tracking Board. The site also claimed that Universal would be working with Silvertongue Films, a production house launched to develop Scholastic books into feature films, and that Deborah Forte would be producing. In June 2020, it was formally announced that an Animorphs film would be produced by Scholastic Entertainment, and Picturestart, the latter run by Erik Feig and Lucy Kitada. Script development will be overseen by Caitlin Friedman and Royce Reeves Darby. Animorphs authors Katherine Applegate and Michael Grant initially agreed to collaborate on the project, but in October 2020 Grant announced via Twitter that he and Applegate would not be a part of the film's production, citing \"creative differences\". Grant later clarified his remark, wishing the producers the best and noting he and Applegate simply weren't being involved enough in the production process.

Books 1 and 2 were released on January 7, 2020, with subsequent releases on the first or second Tuesday of each month for 5 months. There was a brief hiatus, then books 11 and 12 were released on January 26, 2021, following the same pattern. After another hiatus 21 and 22 were released on November 8, 2021, following the same way. Since June 2022, Books 31 and on have been released on the first Tuesday of every month. Six narrators are used, one for each of the main characters. MacLeod Andrews narrates Jake (and Elfangor, for The Andalite Chronicles), Emily Ellet for Rachel, Michael Crouch for Tobias, Sisi Aisha Johnson for Cassie, Ram\u00f3n de Ocampo for Marco, and Adam Verner for Ax. Mark Bramhall narrates as Jake's Civil War ancestor Isaiah Fitzhenry for parts of book #47, The Resistance. Scholastic announced plans to launch a graphic novel adaptation of Animorphs via its Scholastic Graphix imprint. The first release, adapting The Invasion, was released on October 6, 2020, with art by Eisner-Award nominee Chris Grine. The second novel, adapting The Visitor, was released on October 5, 2021. The third novel, adapting The Encounter, was released on October 4, 2022. The fourth novel, adapting The Message, according to Amazon, will be released on December 5, 2023.\n\nquestion: Who do the main characters battle against with their abilities?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Visser Three.", "usage": 500}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

These novels tell more subtle stories, where the line between human and other blurs Say the words \u201calien invasion\u201d and the stories most people think of are those told in movies like Roland Emmerich\u2019s Independence Day (1996), in which the battle lines between good and evil are cleanly divided. HG Wells dreamed up this template in 1897, with Martian invaders laying waste the home counties in The War of the Worlds. Half a century later, John Wyndham\u2019s The Kraken Wakes (1953) envisaged the melting of the ice caps not as the by-product of human negligence but as the result of a hostile intervention by alien forces. In writing my novel Conquest, I was determined to subvert these violent stereotypes. What I find most compelling about earlier alien invasion narratives is the way they highlight how vulnerable we are, not to aliens so much as our own irrational behaviour in the face of the unknown. I wanted to reveal the theme of alien invasion as infinitely flexible, adapting itself to subtle, ambiguous stories in which the divide between human and alien is not always clear cut. My protagonist Frank Landau stands in permanent danger of losing his sanity to his obsessions. And yet Frank has a brilliant mind; in many ways, he is the most sensitive and compassionate individual in the novel. The tension between these two truths is the engine that drives Conquest, and it is this irreconcilable contradiction between delusion and epiphany I find most fascinating in other alien invasion stories. Here are 10 of my favourites: 1. Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeerVandermeer\u2019s Southern Reach trilogy charts the exploration of alien incursions in a remote, segregated area of wilderness that keeps expanding. The scientists who venture into Area X find it impossible to communicate the reality of their experiences there, a failure of language that makes the encounter all the more traumatic. 2. How High We Go in the Dark by Sequoia NagamatsuThe alien presence in this book was on Earth all the time: a prehistoric virus, released from melting permafrost as the result of climate change. Nagamatsu\u2019s subtle, heartfelt novel is constructed as a series of linked stories, beginning with the discovery of the virus and moving forward through time to reveal a world irrevocably altered by the resulting pandemic, and not always for the worse. 3. The Book of Strange New Things by Michel FaberIn Faber\u2019s novel, we are the invading aliens, and the book\u2019s protagonist, Peter Leigh, travels to the planet Oasis as a Christian missionary. His wife, Bea, is left behind on an Earth that is becoming increasingly divided through social upheavals resulting from climate change. Faber\u2019s vision is bleak, alienating, even frightening, but there is redemption here too. This novel\u2019s strange, hypnotic power poses questions that linger long after reading. 4. Agents of Dreamland by Caitl\u00edn R KiernanThe first in a trilogy of taut novellas that combine the bitter essence of noir with the cosmic terror of Lovecraft, Agents of Dreamland recounts the secret history of shadowy operatives who wrestle, like angels and demons, for the soul and continuing existence of the human race. The battle takes place in a world grown stale and grubby from government corruption, where consensus reality is steadily becoming eroded. Kiernan\u2019s language and manner of telling manages to be both lyrical and sharp as thorns. 5. Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris StrugatskyAt some point in the recent past, aliens visited Earth. They left no trace, other than the curiously altered \u201czones\u201d littered with mysterious relics, some wondrous, some deadly. These objects have no apparent purpose, but exert a powerful influence on all who encounter them. Red Schuhart is a \u201cstalker\u201d, earning a perilous living guiding fortune-hunters and thrill-seekers through the zone. This book \u2013 translated from the Russian by Antonina W Bouis \u2013 is harsh, tender, magical and, like all Soviet science fiction, full of double meanings. 6. XX by Rian HughesA radio telescope at Jodrell Bank has picked up a signal believed to be of extra-terrestrial origin. Jack Fenwick, an expert in the developing science of artificial intelligence, is tasked with interpreting the signal and locating its source. The plotline of XX could be straight out of Fred Hoyle or Arthur C Clarke. But there the similarity ends, for Hughes, a comic book artist and designer of typefaces, knows science fiction well enough to push its boundaries. Hughes\u2019s central interest lies with text itself, and how it might be manipulated to alter the reader\u2019s perception of reality. To read XX is to glimpse the alien first-hand, if only from the corner of your eye. 7.

Their reality becomes gradually destabilised as each comes to suspect that they are witnessing the dawn of a new world order. Being characters in a Harrison narrative, their reaction to the catastrophe is somewhat muted. If you are not already a Harrison reader, this novel \u2013 as acute a portrait as any of the way we live now \u2013 is the place to start. 8. The Employees by Olga RavnThis unfolds as a series of individual reports filed by crew members, both human and AI, working aboard an interdimensional spacecraft. The crew has been entrusted with the care of a number of alien artefacts, strange objects that might almost have come from the zone in Roadside Picnic. As their mysterious journey continues, the employees begin to experience altered states, hallucinations and separation anxiety, seemingly as a direct result of their contact with the alien. This exquisitely strange short novel, translated from the Danish by Martin Aitken, began life as the textual accompaniment to an art installation by Danish artist Lea Guldditte Hestelund. Its mission: to investigate the nature of being human. 9. Lagoon by Nnedi OkoraforWith its jump cuts and tessellations, Okorafor\u2019s playful, almost filmic account of an alien expedition to the city of Lagos feels unlike any alien invasion story you might have read before. Science fiction cohabits with fantasy to produce a vigorous, gorgeous mutation teeming with deft postmodernist touches: chapters told from non-human points of view, snapshots of reportage, moments when Okorafor breaks the fourth wall to ask how readers might have reacted had they been there. A joyously experimental text, Lagoon shimmers with the delirium and chaos that might be expected from an alien visit. 10. Story of Your Life by Ted ChiangChiang\u2019s 1999 novella is one of the most subtle and life-affirming explorations of language, time and perception to be found in all of science fiction. Linguist Louise Banks is attempting to unravel the seemingly insoluble mystery of how to communicate with the alien \u201cheptapods\u201d that have landed on Earth. At the same time, she is trying to come to terms with the death of her daughter. As with all Chiang\u2019s fiction, the story unfolds through pursuing a deeper understanding of a stated reality, in this instance an entirely alien language that seems to have no human equivalent. Denis Villeneuve\u2019s 2016 film adaptation Arrival is a fine piece of work, but Chiang\u2019s original story is even better, engaging the emotions and the intellect with equal force.

A. Applegate, and published by Scholastic. It is told in first person, with all six main characters taking turns narrating the books through their own perspectives. Horror, war, dehumanization, sanity, morality, innocence, leadership, freedom, family, and growing up are the core themes of the series. The series was originally conceived as a three-part series called The Changelings, in which Jake was named Matt, and his little brother Joseph took the place of Cassie. Published between June 1996 and May 2001, the series consists of 54 books and includes ten companion books, eight of which fit into the series' continuity (the Animorphs Chronicles and Megamorphs books) and two that are gamebooks not fitting into the continuity (the Alternamorphs books). The books were adapted into a television series of the same name on Nickelodeon, YTV and Global Television Network, which ran from 1998 to 1999. The series has also been adapted to audiobook form as well as a series of graphic novels starting in 2020. A film adaptation was announced in September 2015. The story revolves around five humans: Jake, Marco, Cassie, Rachel and Tobias, and one alien, Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill (nicknamed Ax), who obtain the ability to transform into any animal they touch. Naming themselves \"Animorphs\" (a portmanteau of \"animal morphers\"), they use their ability to battle a secret alien infiltration of Earth by a parasitic race of aliens resembling large slugs called Yeerks, that can take any living creatures as a host by entering and merging with their brain through the ear canal. The Animorphs fight as a guerilla force against the Yeerks who are led by Visser Three. Throughout the series, the Animorphs carefully protect their identities; the Yeerks assume that the Animorphs are a strike force sent by the Andalites, the alien race to which Ax belongs that created the transformation technology, to prevent them from conquering Earth. To protect their families from Yeerk reprisals, the Animorphs maintain this fa\u00e7ade. Though the Animorphs can assume the form of any animal they touch to acquire the DNA, there are several limitations to the ability. The most vital is that they cannot stay in animal form for more than two hours, or they will be unable to return to human form and the morphs become permanent. Others include having to de-morph back to human in between morphs, only tight clothing being able to be carried over with a morph, DNA allergies that can lose some control of the morphing ability, and having to consistently maintain concentration during a morph to prevent the animal's natural instincts from overwhelming their human intellect. A benefit to morphing is that it allows the team to heal any superficial, non-genetic injury, sustained as a human or in a morph. Also, while in morph, they can telepathically communicate with anyone nearby in what they call 'thought-speak'. In an interview with Publishers Weekly, Applegate talked about the source of inspiration and realization for the Animorphs series: \"I grew up loving animals and lived with the usual suburban menagerie of dogs, cats and gerbils\", she said \"I really wanted to find a way to get kids into the heads of various species and decided that a science-fiction premise was the way to do this\". Applegate tried to accurately depict the various animals, and did research such as visiting \"a raptor center where they rehabilitate injured birds\". \"When Tobias becomes a hawk, I want the reader to see the world as a hawk might see it\u2014to soar on the warm breezes and hurtle toward the ground to make a kill\", she said. To develop the characters for Animorphs, Applegate would go through teenage magazines such as YM and Seventeen (both of which are referenced in the books when describing Rachel), cutting out pictures and piecing them together to get an idea of what sort of children the Animorphs would look like. Applegate stated in an interview online that many of the names for her alien creatures, races, and locations are actually scrambled names of local street signs or companies that she happens to notice. For instance, the word nothlit was derived from the hotel name Hilton. In another interview, Applegate stated that she originally wanted the alien Andalite to have more standard and familiar forms, but was told by Scholastic to be more creative with the designs, which led to her giving them such distinctive look. According to the Anibase, Applegate did not make up the titles for the Animorphs books: it was up to the Scholastic editors to create the titles for the books based on the outlines provided by the author, having to select a word that not only fit the\n\nquestion: How many companion books are there in the series?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "ten", "usage": 1117}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

One of the author's favorite books, The Lord of the Rings, lent several words and images to Animorphs: the Sindarin plural word for Orc, \"yrch\", became Yeerk; the flaming red Eye of Sauron inspired the Crayak, and Ax's middle name, \"Esgarrouth\", is based on a town in the books called Esgaroth. The human name of Ax's brother, Elfangor, is Alan Fangor and his last name is in reference to the Fangor region or Fangorn Forest. Also there was a minor reference to Gondor, in the form of a fictional company named \"Gondor Industries\" in the 14th book. Applegate's writing was inspired by her family. All books after The Unknown were dedicated to Applegate's first daughter, Clara, under her former name, as well as Applegate's husband and co-writer, Michael. Her daughter was born premature in 1997, and Applegate worked on the Animorphs series at night, in the lobby of the hospital where she was in Neonatal Intensive Care (NIC). Each book in the series revolved around a given event during the war waged between the Animorphs and the invading Yeerks. Within a year and a half after the first book was published, the series had close to ten million copies in print, with Scholastic claiming a \"stronger initial sell-in\" than any of its other series up to that time. The series debut was preceded by a large marketing campaign which included posters on buildings, giveaway items in bookstores, and ads on Nickelodeon TV. In the United States, the books were most popular as A5-sized paperback volumes, and were usually between 150 and 200 pages long, divided into just under thirty chapters. The front covers featured images of the narrating Animorph undergoing the various stages of one of the morphs from the story, with a few exceptions (noted in each book's article). Behind the morphing character were images of clouds and skies, which became more colorful and elaborate as the series progressed. All the covers of the regular series books had a small cutout over part of the full morph's anatomy, revealing a computer-generated illustration on the first page, which was printed on glossy paper. The illustration shared the image of the full morph with the front cover, but placed within an environment from the story. The book spines repeated the narrating character's face from the front cover, and the spine color changed with every new episode, resulting in a very colorful collection when viewed from any angle. A small excerpt from one of the book's chapters was printed on the inside of every front cover. As of the eighth book, The Alien, the Animorphs logo, the author's name, and the book's title were printed in glossy, metallic-look ink, rather than the flat colors that had been used for the first seven books. In addition, the author's name and book title were surrounded by solid black rectangles. The majority of the books in the series were printed only in \"metallic-ink editions\". All further reprintings of the first seven books had this treatment applied to them as well. The books in the series' final arc, beginning with the 45th book, The Revelation had yet another treatment applied to the cover, a variation on the new metallic style; the change affected only the main 'Animorphs' logo: instead of consisting of white letters superimposed on a metallic, colored background, the last ten books featured a logo with colored letters over a dark grey background, in contrast with the white logo background from the series' \"opening arc\". The final book, #54 The Beginning had a unique cover style, with the logo consisting of a glowing outline. Every book featured an introduction to the series on the back cover, in the voice of Jake, one of the Animorphs. We can't tell you who we are. Or where we live. It's too risky, and we've got to be careful. Really careful. So we don't trust anyone. Because if they find us... well, we just won't let them find us. The thing you should know is that everyone is in really big trouble. Yeah. Even you. As of book 51, The Absolute, the introduction read as follows: Here's the deal these days: They know exactly who we are. They know exactly where we live. We've got a few secrets left, and we're gonna use them. But just know that the end is coming. And we don't know how much longer we can do this. How much longer can we fight. What about you?

These novels tell more subtle stories, where the line between human and other blurs Say the words \u201calien invasion\u201d and the stories most people think of are those told in movies like Roland Emmerich\u2019s Independence Day (1996), in which the battle lines between good and evil are cleanly divided. HG Wells dreamed up this template in 1897, with Martian invaders laying waste the home counties in The War of the Worlds. Half a century later, John Wyndham\u2019s The Kraken Wakes (1953) envisaged the melting of the ice caps not as the by-product of human negligence but as the result of a hostile intervention by alien forces. In writing my novel Conquest, I was determined to subvert these violent stereotypes. What I find most compelling about earlier alien invasion narratives is the way they highlight how vulnerable we are, not to aliens so much as our own irrational behaviour in the face of the unknown. I wanted to reveal the theme of alien invasion as infinitely flexible, adapting itself to subtle, ambiguous stories in which the divide between human and alien is not always clear cut. My protagonist Frank Landau stands in permanent danger of losing his sanity to his obsessions. And yet Frank has a brilliant mind; in many ways, he is the most sensitive and compassionate individual in the novel. The tension between these two truths is the engine that drives Conquest, and it is this irreconcilable contradiction between delusion and epiphany I find most fascinating in other alien invasion stories. Here are 10 of my favourites: 1. Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeerVandermeer\u2019s Southern Reach trilogy charts the exploration of alien incursions in a remote, segregated area of wilderness that keeps expanding. The scientists who venture into Area X find it impossible to communicate the reality of their experiences there, a failure of language that makes the encounter all the more traumatic. 2. How High We Go in the Dark by Sequoia NagamatsuThe alien presence in this book was on Earth all the time: a prehistoric virus, released from melting permafrost as the result of climate change. Nagamatsu\u2019s subtle, heartfelt novel is constructed as a series of linked stories, beginning with the discovery of the virus and moving forward through time to reveal a world irrevocably altered by the resulting pandemic, and not always for the worse. 3. The Book of Strange New Things by Michel FaberIn Faber\u2019s novel, we are the invading aliens, and the book\u2019s protagonist, Peter Leigh, travels to the planet Oasis as a Christian missionary. His wife, Bea, is left behind on an Earth that is becoming increasingly divided through social upheavals resulting from climate change. Faber\u2019s vision is bleak, alienating, even frightening, but there is redemption here too. This novel\u2019s strange, hypnotic power poses questions that linger long after reading. 4. Agents of Dreamland by Caitl\u00edn R KiernanThe first in a trilogy of taut novellas that combine the bitter essence of noir with the cosmic terror of Lovecraft, Agents of Dreamland recounts the secret history of shadowy operatives who wrestle, like angels and demons, for the soul and continuing existence of the human race. The battle takes place in a world grown stale and grubby from government corruption, where consensus reality is steadily becoming eroded. Kiernan\u2019s language and manner of telling manages to be both lyrical and sharp as thorns. 5. Roadside Picnic by Arkady and Boris StrugatskyAt some point in the recent past, aliens visited Earth. They left no trace, other than the curiously altered \u201czones\u201d littered with mysterious relics, some wondrous, some deadly. These objects have no apparent purpose, but exert a powerful influence on all who encounter them. Red Schuhart is a \u201cstalker\u201d, earning a perilous living guiding fortune-hunters and thrill-seekers through the zone. This book \u2013 translated from the Russian by Antonina W Bouis \u2013 is harsh, tender, magical and, like all Soviet science fiction, full of double meanings. 6. XX by Rian HughesA radio telescope at Jodrell Bank has picked up a signal believed to be of extra-terrestrial origin. Jack Fenwick, an expert in the developing science of artificial intelligence, is tasked with interpreting the signal and locating its source. The plotline of XX could be straight out of Fred Hoyle or Arthur C Clarke. But there the similarity ends, for Hughes, a comic book artist and designer of typefaces, knows science fiction well enough to push its boundaries. Hughes\u2019s central interest lies with text itself, and how it might be manipulated to alter the reader\u2019s perception of reality. To read XX is to glimpse the alien first-hand, if only from the corner of your eye. 7. The Sunken Land Begins to Rise Again\n\nquestion: How many companion books are there in the series?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1096}, "You are an answer-extraction expert. Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Animorphs: The Science Fantasy Young Adult Series\n\nevidence:  by M John HarrisonHarrison\u2019s Goldsmiths prize-winning novel is ostensibly the story of Shaw and Victoria, two ex-lovers each caught in the jaws of a mid-life crisis. Their reality becomes gradually destabilised as each comes to suspect that they are witnessing the dawn of a new world order. Being characters in a Harrison narrative, their reaction to the catastrophe is somewhat muted. If you are not already a Harrison reader, this novel \u2013 as acute a portrait as any of the way we live now \u2013 is the place to start. 8. The Employees by Olga RavnThis unfolds as a series of individual reports filed by crew members, both human and AI, working aboard an interdimensional spacecraft. The crew has been entrusted with the care of a number of alien artefacts, strange objects that might almost have come from the zone in Roadside Picnic. As their mysterious journey continues, the employees begin to experience altered states, hallucinations and separation anxiety, seemingly as a direct result of their contact with the alien. This exquisitely strange short novel, translated from the Danish by Martin Aitken, began life as the textual accompaniment to an art installation by Danish artist Lea Guldditte Hestelund. Its mission: to investigate the nature of being human. 9. Lagoon by Nnedi OkoraforWith its jump cuts and tessellations, Okorafor\u2019s playful, almost filmic account of an alien expedition to the city of Lagos feels unlike any alien invasion story you might have read before. Science fiction cohabits with fantasy to produce a vigorous, gorgeous mutation teeming with deft postmodernist touches: chapters told from non-human points of view, snapshots of reportage, moments when Okorafor breaks the fourth wall to ask how readers might have reacted had they been there. A joyously experimental text, Lagoon shimmers with the delirium and chaos that might be expected from an alien visit. 10. Story of Your Life by Ted ChiangChiang\u2019s 1999 novella is one of the most subtle and life-affirming explorations of language, time and perception to be found in all of science fiction. Linguist Louise Banks is attempting to unravel the seemingly insoluble mystery of how to communicate with the alien \u201cheptapods\u201d that have landed on Earth. At the same time, she is trying to come to terms with the death of her daughter. As with all Chiang\u2019s fiction, the story unfolds through pursuing a deeper understanding of a stated reality, in this instance an entirely alien language that seems to have no human equivalent. Denis Villeneuve\u2019s 2016 film adaptation Arrival is a fine piece of work, but Chiang\u2019s original story is even better, engaging the emotions and the intellect with equal force. Conquest by Nina Allan is published by riverrun. To help the Guardian and Observer, order your copy from guardianbookshop.com.
