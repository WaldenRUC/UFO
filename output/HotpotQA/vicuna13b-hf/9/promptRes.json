Hays was a local lawyer who served briefly in the United States House of Representatives, replacing Edwin H. Conger who resigned to become the United States Ambassador to Brazil.  Hays died a year after the house was completed.  The family continued to live here until 1935 when it became the Bybee & Davis Funeral Home.  The 2\u00bd-story brick structure was designed by the Des Moines architectural firm of Foster & Liebbe in a combination of the Late Victorian and Italianate styles.

The Cresco Opera House Company was organized around the same time.  The building was completed by the end of the year, and it opened in 1915.  It was designed by local engineer Joseph H. Howe, and constructed by local builder Martin Johnson.  The musical \"High Jinks\" was the first performance held in the theater.  The theater, which seats 425, was equipped to show movies and there was a community hall in the basement.

Mendocino County, California, was the first jurisdiction in the United States to ban the cultivation, production or distribution of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The ordinance, entitled Measure H, was passed by referendum on March 2, 2004.  Initiated by the group \"GMO Free Mendocino\", the campaign was a highly publicized grassroots effort by local farmers and environmental groups who contend that the potential risks of GMOs to human health and the ecosystem have not yet been fully understood.  The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry, The California Plant Health Association (now the Western Plant Health Association) and CropLife America, a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation, including Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical.

Though Percy had been expected to coast to re-election over Seith, a first-time candidate, the election quickly became competitive.  In the last few days of the campaign, a desperate Percy ran a television advertisement that featured him apologizing and acknowledging that, \"I got your message and you're right.\"  Percy's last-ditch effort appeared to have paid off, as he was able to edge out Seith to win what would end up being his third and final term in the Senate.\n\nquestion: Where was Local H formed?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 269}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In 1920, he bought a tract of land where the present-day Breezy Point Resort is located, and he began building cottages and a large log lodge.  The lodge has since burnt down.  He built the Fawcett House as a private residence within the resort property.  Fawcett hired the Minneapolis architects of Magney and Tusler and commissioned the design in the Swiss Chateau style.  The rustic log style was a bit ironic, since the local logging industry had declined before the resort was built.\n\nquestion: What is the latest album of For Against?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 302}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The 1978 United States Senate election in Illinois took place on November 7, 1978.  Incumbent Republican United States Senator Charles H. Percy ran for re-election to a third term in the United States Senate.  Percy was opposed by Democratic nominee Alex Seith, an attorney who had been appointed to several local government positions.  Though Percy had been expected to coast to re-election over Seith, a first-time candidate, the election quickly became competitive.  In the last few days of the campaign, a desperate Percy ran a television advertisement that featured him apologizing and acknowledging that, \"I got your message and you're right.\"  Percy's last-ditch effort appeared to have paid off, as he was able to edge out Seith to win what would end up being his third and final term in the Senate.\n\nquestion: What is the latest album of For Against?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 272}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.
