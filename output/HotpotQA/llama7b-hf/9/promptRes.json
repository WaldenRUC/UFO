Initiated by the group \"GMO Free Mendocino\", the campaign was a highly publicized grassroots effort by local farmers and environmental groups who contend that the potential risks of GMOs to human health and the ecosystem have not yet been fully understood.  The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry, The California Plant Health Association (now the Western Plant Health Association) and CropLife America, a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation, including Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical.

Fawcett, also known as \"Captain Billy\", started the book \"Captain Billy's Whiz Bang\" as a joke book for soldiers during World War I.  He formed Fawcett Publications in 1919 in Robbinsdale, Minnesota.  In 1920, he bought a tract of land where the present-day Breezy Point Resort is located, and he began building cottages and a large log lodge.  The lodge has since burnt down.  He built the Fawcett House as a private residence within the resort property.  Fawcett hired the Minneapolis architects of Magney and Tusler and commissioned the design in the Swiss Chateau style.  The rustic log style was a bit ironic, since the local logging industry had declined before the resort was built.\n\nquestion: What genres are Local H and For Against associated with?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 301}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.
