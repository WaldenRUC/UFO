Walter Gillings was editor for the first two issues, and was then replaced by John Carnell, the editor of \"New Worlds\", as a cost-saving measure.  Carnell edited both magazines until Nova went out of business in early 1964.  The titles were acquired by Roberts & Vinter, who hired Kyril Bonfiglioli to edit \"Science Fantasy\"; Bonfiglioli changed the title to \"Impulse\" in early 1966, but the new title led to confusion with the distributors and sales fell, though the magazine remained profitable.  The title was changed again to \"SF Impulse\" for the last few issues.  \"Science Fantasy\" ceased publication the following year, when Roberts & Vinter came under financial pressure after their printer went bankrupt.\n\nquestion: What is science fantasy?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 290}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Dozens of Square Enix companion books have been produced since 1998, when video game developer Square began to produce books that focused on artwork, developer interviews, and background information on the fictional worlds and characters in its games rather than on gameplay details.  The first series of these books was the \"Perfect Works\" series, written and published by Square subsidiary DigiCube.  They produced three books between 1998 and 1999 before the line was stopped in favor of the \"Ultimania\" (\u30a2\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30de\u30cb\u30a2, Arutimania ) series, a portmanteau of ultimate and mania.  This series of books is written by Studio BentStuff, which had previously written game guides for Square for \"Final Fantasy VII\".  They were published by DigiCube until the company was dissolved in 2003.
