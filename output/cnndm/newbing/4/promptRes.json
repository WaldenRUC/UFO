Just two weeks after her supposed death on March 31, 1945, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated -- timing that showed how close the Jewish diarist had been to surviving the Holocaust. But new research released by the Anne Frank House shows that Anne and her older sister, Margot Frank, died at least a month earlier than previously thought. Researchers re-examined archives of the Red Cross, the International Training Service and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial, along with testimonies of survivors. They concluded that Anne and Margot probably did not survive to March 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by Dutch authorities. In 1944, Anne and seven others hiding in the Amsterdam secret annex were arrested and sent to the  Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Anne Frank's final entry. That same year, Anne and Margot were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany. Days at the camp were filled with terror and dread, witnesses said. The sisters stayed in a section of the overcrowded camp with no lighting, little water and no latrine. They slept on lice-ridden straw and violent storms shredded the tents, according to the researchers. Like the other prisoners, the sisters endured long hours at roll call.

But, now, a new report is calling that into question: its authors concluded that Anne\u2019s commonly-accepted death date of late March 1945 is at least a month off. The Anne Frank House museum has announced that Frank probably died in February 1945, a good month before the death date traditionally estimated by historians. Historians estimated the new date based on a reassessment of eyewitness accounts and Red Cross documents that used to place Anne\u2019s death date in March 1945. Their report was published yesterday on what was formerly thought to be the 70th anniversary of the death of Anne and her sister Margot, who were captured, forced into slave labor at Auschwitz-Birkenau and left to die of typhus at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The new narrative challenges the assumption that if the Franks had held on just a little longer, they\u2019d have made it to the camp\u2019s liberation, Anne Frank House researcher Erika Prins told the Guardian: \u201cWhen you say they died at the end of March, it gives you a feeling that they died just before liberation. So maybe if they\u2019d lived two more weeks \u2026\u201d Prins said, her voice trailing off. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not true any more.\u201d Seventy years later, the story of the Franks still has the power to intrigue, sparking interest in everything from her relatives to her childhood to her complex legacy. A new perspective on her death places her more squarely in the ranks of more than six million Jews and other civilians who died in over 40,000 ghettos and camps under Nazi rule.

Our editors will review what you\u2019ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Anne Frank, a Jewish teenager, wrote a diary of her family\u2019s two years in hiding (1942\u201344) during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, and the book\u2014which was first published in 1947, two years after Anne\u2019s death in a concentration camp\u2014became a classic of war literature, personalizing the Holocaust. Through her diary, Anne Frank is shown to be insightful, humorous, and intelligent. Many entries involve typical adolescent issues\u2014jealousy toward her sister; annoyance with others, especially her mother; and an increasing sexual awareness. Anne also discussed her hopes for the future, which included becoming a journalist or a writer. On August 4, 1944, Anne Frank\u2019s family\u2019s hiding place was discovered by the Gestapo, and she was taken to Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland before being transferred to Bergen-Belsen in Germany. According to the Dutch government, Anne died during a typhus epidemic in March 1945. Other research suggests she might have perished in February that year. Anne Frank, (born June 12, 1929, Frankfurt am Main, Germany\u2014died February/March 1945, Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, near Hannover), Jewish girl whose diary of her family\u2019s two years in hiding during the German occupation of the Netherlands became a classic of war literature. Early in the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, Anne\u2019s father, Otto Frank (1889\u20131980), a German businessman, took his wife and two daughters to live in Amsterdam. In 1941, after German forces occupied the Netherlands, Anne was compelled to transfer from a public school to a Jewish one. On June 12, 1942, she received a red-and-white plaid diary for her 13th birthday. That day she began writing in the book: \u201cI hope I will be able to confide everything to you, as I have never been able to confide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support.\u201d When Anne\u2019s sister, Margot, was faced with deportation (supposedly to a forced-labour camp), the Franks went into hiding on July 6, 1942, in the backroom office and warehouse of Otto Frank\u2019s food-products business. With the aid of a few non-Jewish friends, among them Miep Gies, who smuggled in food and other supplies, the Frank family and four other Jews\u2014Hermann and Auguste van Pels and their son, Peter, and Fritz Pfeffer\u2014lived confined to the \u201csecret annex.\u201d During this time, Anne wrote faithfully in her diary, recounting day-to-day life in hiding, from ordinary annoyances to the fear of capture. She discussed typical adolescent issues as well as her hopes for the future, which included becoming a journalist or a writer. Anne\u2019s last diary entry was written on August 1, 1944. Three days later the annex was discovered by the Gestapo, which was acting on a tip from Dutch informers. The Frank family was transported to Westerbork, a transit camp in the Netherlands, and from there to Auschwitz, in German-occupied Poland, on September 3, 1944, on the last transport to leave Westerbork for Auschwitz. Anne and Margot were transferred to Bergen-Belsen the following month. Anne\u2019s mother died in early January, just before the evacuation of Auschwitz on January 18, 1945. It was established by the Dutch government that both Anne and Margot died in a typhus epidemic in March 1945, only weeks before the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, but scholars in 2015 revealed new research, including analysis of archival data and first-person accounts, indicating that the sisters might have perished in February 1945. Otto Frank was found hospitalized at Auschwitz when it was liberated by Soviet troops on January 27, 1945. Friends who searched the hiding place after the family\u2019s capture later gave Otto Frank the papers left behind by the Gestapo. Among them he found Anne\u2019s diary, which was published as Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl (originally in Dutch, 1947). Precocious in style and insight, it traces her emotional growth amid adversity. In it she wrote, \u201cI still believe, in spite of everything, that people are really good at heart.\u201d The Diary, which has been translated into more than 65 languages, is the most widely read diary of the Holocaust, and Anne is probably the best known of Holocaust victims. The Diary was also made into a play that premiered on Broadway in October 1955, and in 1956 it won both the Tony Award for best play and the Pulitzer Prize for best drama. A film version directed by George Stevens was produced in 1959.

Anne likely died, aged 15, at Bergen-Belsen camp in February 1945, said Erika Prins, a researcher at the Anne Frank House museum. Frank's diary about hiding from the Nazis in the occupied Netherlands during World War II was published after the war. It became an international best-seller and made her an enduring symbol of Holocaust victims. The new date of her death changes little about the tragic lives of Anne and her sister Margot, who went into hiding with their family in an Amsterdam canal house but were eventually betrayed, sent to Nazi concentration camps and died in the Holocaust along with millions of other Jews. \"It was horrible. It was terrible. And it still is,\" Prins said. But she said the new date lays to rest the idea that the sisters could have been rescued if they had lived just a little longer. \"When you say they died at the end of March, it gives you a feeling that they died just before liberation. So maybe if they'd lived two more weeks...,\" Prins said, her voice trailing off. \"Well, that's not true anymore.\" Allied forces liberated the Nazis' Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on April 15, 1945. The earlier March 31 date of Anne's death was set by Dutch authorities after the war, based on accounts suggesting she and her sister died sometime in March. At the time, Dutch officials did not have the resources to establish an exact date. The new research studied existing eyewitness accounts, documents and archives, including at least one new interview. Witness accounts said Anne and her sister already showed signs of typhus in early February. Researchers cited Dutch health authorities as saying most typhus deaths happen around 12 days after the first symptoms. \"In view of this, the date of their death is more likely to be sometime in February. The exact date is unknown,\" the researchers said. In the words of one witness, Rachel van Amerongen, who knew the Frank sisters and was cited by researchers, \"one day they simply weren't there anymore.\" First published on March 31, 2015 / 10:48 AM EDT \u00a9 2015 The Associated Press.

January 12, 2016 Yesterday, staff and volunteers of the Commission participated in an enrichment session addressing changes to the scholarship about Anne Frank. The program examined new research about the deaths of Anne and Margot Frank. January 11 Volunteer Enrichment.jpg On March 31, 2015, the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam published new research clarifying the death dates of the Frank sisters at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The exact date of the sisters' deaths has never been known for sure. After the war, the Red Cross officially concluded that they died of typhus some time between March 1 and 31, 1945. The new research states that it is unlikely they were still alive in March; their deaths must have occurred in February. The research utilized the archives of the Red Cross, the International Tracing Service in Bad Arolsen, and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial. It also included a combination of eyewitness testimonies from survivors, existing literature, and scientific statistics for the progression of the disease that killed the Frank sisters. Typhus is fatal in 40-60% of cases around 12 days after the first symptoms appear. (Source: Anne Frank House.) Anne and Margot were showing symptoms in January 1945. The disease was rampant at the camp, spreading rapidly in the unsanitary conditions. Between July and December 1944, the number of prisoners at Bergen-Belsen doubled. By February 1945, that number increased by another 50%. With this massive influx of new prisoners, which included Anne and Margot who were transported from Auschwitz, conditions at the camp worsened considerably. Witnesses who knew the Frank sisters provided testimony confirming that they girls died within days of each other. Margot perished before her younger sister. Anne and Margot were among tens of thousands of prisoners who died in the first few months of 1945 from typhus, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and dysentery. The camp was liberated by British forces on April 15, 1945. More than 13,000 former prisoners died after liberation. They were too ill to recover and the British burned down the whole camp in order to prevent any further spread of disease.

But, now, a new report is calling that into question: its authors concluded that Anne\u2019s commonly-accepted death date of late March 1945 is at least a month off. The Anne Frank House museum has announced that Frank probably died in February 1945, a good month before the death date traditionally estimated by historians. Historians estimated the new date based on a reassessment of eyewitness accounts and Red Cross documents that used to place Anne\u2019s death date in March 1945. Their report was published yesterday on what was formerly thought to be the 70th anniversary of the death of Anne and her sister Margot, who were captured, forced into slave labor at Auschwitz-Birkenau and left to die of typhus at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The new narrative challenges the assumption that if the Franks had held on just a little longer, they\u2019d have made it to the camp\u2019s liberation, Anne Frank House researcher Erika Prins told the Guardian: \u201cWhen you say they died at the end of March, it gives you a feeling that they died just before liberation. So maybe if they\u2019d lived two more weeks \u2026\u201d Prins said, her voice trailing off. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not true any more.\u201d Seventy years later, the story of the Franks still has the power to intrigue, sparking interest in everything from her relatives to her childhood to her complex legacy. A new perspective on her death places her more squarely in the ranks of more than six million Jews and other civilians who died in over 40,000 ghettos and camps under Nazi rule.

Anne Frank, a Jewish teenager, wrote a diary of her family\u2019s two years in hiding (1942\u201344) during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, and the book\u2014which was first published in 1947, two years after Anne\u2019s death in a concentration camp\u2014became a classic of war literature, personalizing the Holocaust. Through her diary, Anne Frank is shown to be insightful, humorous, and intelligent. Many entries involve typical adolescent issues\u2014jealousy toward her sister; annoyance with others, especially her mother; and an increasing sexual awareness. Anne also discussed her hopes for the future, which included becoming a journalist or a writer. On August 4, 1944, Anne Frank\u2019s family\u2019s hiding place was discovered by the Gestapo, and she was taken to Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland before being transferred to Bergen-Belsen in Germany.

The disease was rampant at the camp, spreading rapidly in the unsanitary conditions. Between July and December 1944, the number of prisoners at Bergen-Belsen doubled. By February 1945, that number increased by another 50%. With this massive influx of new prisoners, which included Anne and Margot who were transported from Auschwitz, conditions at the camp worsened considerably. Witnesses who knew the Frank sisters provided testimony confirming that they girls died within days of each other. Margot perished before her younger sister. Anne and Margot were among tens of thousands of prisoners who died in the first few months of 1945 from typhus, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and dysentery. The camp was liberated by British forces on April 15, 1945. More than 13,000 former prisoners died after liberation. They were too ill to recover and the British burned down the whole camp in order to prevent any further spread of disease.

But, now, a new report is calling that into question: its authors concluded that Anne\u2019s commonly-accepted death date of late March 1945 is at least a month off. The Anne Frank House museum has announced that Frank probably died in February 1945, a good month before the death date traditionally estimated by historians. Historians estimated the new date based on a reassessment of eyewitness accounts and Red Cross documents that used to place Anne\u2019s death date in March 1945. Their report was published yesterday on what was formerly thought to be the 70th anniversary of the death of Anne and her sister Margot, who were captured, forced into slave labor at Auschwitz-Birkenau and left to die of typhus at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The new narrative challenges the assumption that if the Franks had held on just a little longer, they\u2019d have made it to the camp\u2019s liberation, Anne Frank House researcher Erika Prins told the Guardian: \u201cWhen you say they died at the end of March, it gives you a feeling that they died just before liberation.

Our editors will review what you\u2019ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Anne Frank, a Jewish teenager, wrote a diary of her family\u2019s two years in hiding (1942\u201344) during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, and the book\u2014which was first published in 1947, two years after Anne\u2019s death in a concentration camp\u2014became a classic of war literature, personalizing the Holocaust. Through her diary, Anne Frank is shown to be insightful, humorous, and intelligent. Many entries involve typical adolescent issues\u2014jealousy toward her sister; annoyance with others, especially her mother; and an increasing sexual awareness. Anne also discussed her hopes for the future, which included becoming a journalist or a writer. On August 4, 1944, Anne Frank\u2019s family\u2019s hiding place was discovered by the Gestapo, and she was taken to Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland before being transferred to Bergen-Belsen in Germany. According to the Dutch government, Anne died during a typhus epidemic in March 1945. Other research suggests she might have perished in February that year. Anne Frank, (born June 12, 1929, Frankfurt am Main, Germany\u2014died February/March 1945, Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, near Hannover), Jewish girl whose diary of her family\u2019s two years in hiding during the German occupation of the Netherlands became a classic of war literature. Early in the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, Anne\u2019s father, Otto Frank (1889\u20131980), a German businessman, took his wife and two daughters to live in Amsterdam. In 1941, after German forces occupied the Netherlands, Anne was compelled to transfer from a public school to a Jewish one. On June 12, 1942, she received a red-and-white plaid diary for her 13th birthday. That day she began writing in the book: \u201cI hope I will be able to confide everything to you, as I have never been able to confide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support.\u201d When Anne\u2019s sister, Margot, was faced with deportation (supposedly to a forced-labour camp), the Franks went into hiding on July 6, 1942, in the backroom office and warehouse of Otto Frank\u2019s food-products business. With the aid of a few non-Jewish friends, among them Miep Gies, who smuggled in food and other supplies, the Frank family and four other Jews\u2014Hermann and Auguste van Pels and their son, Peter, and Fritz Pfeffer\u2014lived confined to the \u201csecret annex.\u201d During this time, Anne wrote faithfully in her diary, recounting day-to-day life in hiding, from ordinary annoyances to the fear of capture. She discussed typical adolescent issues as well as her hopes for the future, which included becoming a journalist or a writer. Anne\u2019s last diary entry was written on August 1, 1944. Three days later the annex was discovered by the Gestapo, which was acting on a tip from Dutch informers. The Frank family was transported to Westerbork, a transit camp in the Netherlands, and from there to Auschwitz, in German-occupied Poland, on September 3, 1944, on the last transport to leave Westerbork for Auschwitz. Anne and Margot were transferred to Bergen-Belsen the following month. Anne\u2019s mother died in early January, just before the evacuation of Auschwitz on January 18, 1945. It was established by the Dutch government that both Anne and Margot died in a typhus epidemic in March 1945, only weeks before the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, but scholars in 2015 revealed new research, including analysis of archival data and first-person accounts, indicating that the sisters might have perished in February 1945. Otto Frank was found hospitalized at Auschwitz when it was liberated by Soviet troops on January 27, 1945. Friends who searched the hiding place after the family\u2019s capture later gave Otto Frank the papers left behind by the Gestapo. Among them he found Anne\u2019s diary, which was published as Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl (originally in Dutch, 1947). Precocious in style and insight, it traces her emotional growth amid adversity. In it she wrote, \u201cI still believe, in spite of everything, that people are really good at heart.\u201d The Diary, which has been translated into more than 65 languages, is the most widely read diary of the Holocaust, and Anne is probably the best known of Holocaust victims. The Diary was also made into a play that premiered on Broadway in October 1955, and in 1956 it won both the Tony Award for best play and the Pulitzer Prize for best drama. A film version directed by George Stevens was produced in 1959.

Anne likely died, aged 15, at Bergen-Belsen camp in February 1945, said Erika Prins, a researcher at the Anne Frank House museum. Frank's diary about hiding from the Nazis in the occupied Netherlands during World War II was published after the war. It became an international best-seller and made her an enduring symbol of Holocaust victims. The new date of her death changes little about the tragic lives of Anne and her sister Margot, who went into hiding with their family in an Amsterdam canal house but were eventually betrayed, sent to Nazi concentration camps and died in the Holocaust along with millions of other Jews. \"It was horrible. It was terrible. And it still is,\" Prins said. But she said the new date lays to rest the idea that the sisters could have been rescued if they had lived just a little longer. \"When you say they died at the end of March, it gives you a feeling that they died just before liberation. So maybe if they'd lived two more weeks...,\" Prins said, her voice trailing off. \"Well, that's not true anymore.\" Allied forces liberated the Nazis' Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on April 15, 1945. The earlier March 31 date of Anne's death was set by Dutch authorities after the war, based on accounts suggesting she and her sister died sometime in March. At the time, Dutch officials did not have the resources to establish an exact date. The new research studied existing eyewitness accounts, documents and archives, including at least one new interview. Witness accounts said Anne and her sister already showed signs of typhus in early February. Researchers cited Dutch health authorities as saying most typhus deaths happen around 12 days after the first symptoms. \"In view of this, the date of their death is more likely to be sometime in February. The exact date is unknown,\" the researchers said. In the words of one witness, Rachel van Amerongen, who knew the Frank sisters and was cited by researchers, \"one day they simply weren't there anymore.\" First published on March 31, 2015 / 10:48 AM EDT \u00a9 2015 The Associated Press.

January 12, 2016 Yesterday, staff and volunteers of the Commission participated in an enrichment session addressing changes to the scholarship about Anne Frank. The program examined new research about the deaths of Anne and Margot Frank. January 11 Volunteer Enrichment.jpg On March 31, 2015, the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam published new research clarifying the death dates of the Frank sisters at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The exact date of the sisters' deaths has never been known for sure. After the war, the Red Cross officially concluded that they died of typhus some time between March 1 and 31, 1945. The new research states that it is unlikely they were still alive in March; their deaths must have occurred in February. The research utilized the archives of the Red Cross, the International Tracing Service in Bad Arolsen, and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial. It also included a combination of eyewitness testimonies from survivors, existing literature, and scientific statistics for the progression of the disease that killed the Frank sisters. Typhus is fatal in 40-60% of cases around 12 days after the first symptoms appear. (Source: Anne Frank House.) Anne and Margot were showing symptoms in January 1945.

At the time, Dutch officials did not have the resources to establish an exact date. The new research studied existing eyewitness accounts, documents and archives, including at least one new interview. Witness accounts said Anne and her sister already showed signs of typhus in early February. Researchers cited Dutch health authorities as saying most typhus deaths happen around 12 days after the first symptoms. \"In view of this, the date of their death is more likely to be sometime in February. The exact date is unknown,\" the researchers said. In the words of one witness, Rachel van Amerongen, who knew the Frank sisters and was cited by researchers, \"one day they simply weren't there anymore.\" First published on March 31, 2015 / 10:48 AM EDT \u00a9 2015 The Associated Press.

Frank probably died, aged 15, at Bergen-Belsen camp in February 1945, said Erika Prins, a researcher at the Anne Frank House museum. The new date of her death lays to rest the idea that the sisters could have been rescued if they had lived just a little longer. Allied forces liberated the Nazis\u2019 Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on 15 April 1945. \u201cWhen you say they died at the end of March, it gives you a feeling that they died just before liberation. So maybe if they\u2019d lived two more weeks \u2026\u201d Prins said, her voice trailing off. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not true any more.\u201d The earlier 31 March date of Anne\u2019s death was set by Dutch authorities after the war, based on accounts suggesting she and her sister died sometime in March. At the time, Dutch officials did not have the resources to establish an exact date. The new research studied existing eyewitness accounts, documents and archives, including at least one new interview. Witness accounts said Anne and her sister already showed signs of typhus in early February. Researchers cited Dutch health authorities as saying most typhus deaths happen around 12 days after the first symptoms. \u201cIn view of this, the date of their death is more likely to be sometime in February. The exact date is unknown,\u201d the researchers said. But the new research changes little about the tragic lives of Anne and her sister Margot, who went into hiding with their family in an Amsterdam canal house but were eventually betrayed, sent to Nazi concentration camps and died in the Holocaust along with millions of other Jews. \u201cIt was horrible. It was terrible. And it still is,\u201d Prins said. Frank\u2019s diary about hiding from the Nazis in the occupied Netherlands during the second world war was published after the war. It became an international bestseller and made her an enduring symbol of Holocaust victims. In the words of one witness, Rachel van Amerongen, who knew the Frank sisters and was cited by researchers: \u201cOne day they simply weren\u2019t there any more.\u201d\n\nquestion: What does the new narrative challenge regarding the assumption about Anne Frank's death?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The new narrative challenges the assumption that Anne Frank died close to the liberation of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.", "usage": 598}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

January 12, 2016 Yesterday, staff and volunteers of the Commission participated in an enrichment session addressing changes to the scholarship about Anne Frank. The program examined new research about the deaths of Anne and Margot Frank. January 11 Volunteer Enrichment.jpg On March 31, 2015, the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam published new research clarifying the death dates of the Frank sisters at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The exact date of the sisters' deaths has never been known for sure. After the war, the Red Cross officially concluded that they died of typhus some time between March 1 and 31, 1945. The new research states that it is unlikely they were still alive in March; their deaths must have occurred in February. The research utilized the archives of the Red Cross, the International Tracing Service in Bad Arolsen, and the Bergen-Belsen Memorial. It also included a combination of eyewitness testimonies from survivors, existing literature, and scientific statistics for the progression of the disease that killed the Frank sisters. Typhus is fatal in 40-60% of cases around 12 days after the first symptoms appear. (Source: Anne Frank House.) Anne and Margot were showing symptoms in January 1945. The disease was rampant at the camp, spreading rapidly in the unsanitary conditions. Between July and December 1944, the number of prisoners at Bergen-Belsen doubled. By February 1945, that number increased by another 50%. With this massive influx of new prisoners, which included Anne and Margot who were transported from Auschwitz, conditions at the camp worsened considerably. Witnesses who knew the Frank sisters provided testimony confirming that they girls died within days of each other. Margot perished before her younger sister. Anne and Margot were among tens of thousands of prisoners who died in the first few months of 1945 from typhus, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and dysentery. The camp was liberated by British forces on April 15, 1945. More than 13,000 former prisoners died after liberation. They were too ill to recover and the British burned down the whole camp in order to prevent any further spread of disease.
