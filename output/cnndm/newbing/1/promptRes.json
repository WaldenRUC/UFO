As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. \"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. \"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\" she said.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: ICC Granted Jurisdiction to Investigate War Crimes in Palestinian Territories\n\nevidence: The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor has opened a formal investigation into alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories. Fatou Bensouda said the probe would cover events in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip since June 2014. Last month, the Hague-based court ruled that it could exercise its criminal jurisdiction over the territories. Israel rejected Ms Bensouda's decision, while Palestinian officials praised it. The US expressed disappointment and opposition to the move. The ICC has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes on the territory of states party to the Rome Statute, its founding treaty. Israel has never ratified the Rome Statute, but the court ruled that it had jurisdiction because the United Nations secretary general accepted the Palestinians' accession to the treaty in 2015. Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians claim the territories for a future independent state. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Ms Bensouda explained that her office was obliged to act \"where a state party has referred a situation\" to it and \"it is determined that a reasonable basis exists to commence an investigation\". Ms Bensouda said she had carried out a \"painstaking preliminary examination\" that lasted close to five years and promised that the investigation would be conducted independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favour. \"We have no agenda other than to meet our statutory duties under the Rome Statute with professional integrity,\" she said, noting that she had declined to investigate the 2010 killing by Israeli troops of 10 Turkish activists on the Gaza-bound ship Mavi Marmara. \"In the current situation, however, there is a reasonable basis to proceed and there are admissible potential cases,\" she added. Ms Bensouda, who will be succeeded by British prosecutor Karim Khan in June, also stressed that the \"central concern must be for the victims of crimes, both Palestinian and Israeli, arising from the long cycle of violence and insecurity that has caused deep suffering and despair on all sides\". The prosecutor's decision came moments before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's glitzy online election campaign launch. He used the stage to give an excoriating response, saying the probe was an anti-Semitic attack on the only Jewish state. This approach will continue in public - to undermine the court itself. Behind the scenes though, concerned officials are working to offset, delay and limit its impact. They will try to show that Israel can investigate itself and that an outgoing prosecutor is tying her successor's hands. They will roll out a plan - understood to be no-expense-spared - to minimise the chance of any future arrest of officers or politicians abroad. Israel's defence minister has acknowledged that \"hundreds\", including himself, could be at risk, adding: \"We will take care of everybody.\" And they will rely on the US and other allies for backing. But the level of rhetoric suggests Israel's leadership feels increasingly worried by the progress of the case. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the ICC's decision was \"the essence of anti-Semitism and the essence of hypocrisy.\" \"It found that our brave and moral soldiers, who are fighting the most brutal terrorists on earth, are, of all people, war criminals.\" \"The court, which was established to prevent a recurrence of the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis against the Jewish people, is now turning against the state of the Jewish people,\" he asserted. US State Department spokesman Ned Price criticised the decision. \"We firmly oppose and are disappointed by the ICC prosecutor's announcement of an investigation into the Palestinian situation,\" he said, adding the US \"will continue to uphold our strong commitment to Israel and its security including by opposing actions that seek to target Israel unfairly\". Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said: \"The crimes committed by the leaders of the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian people - which are ongoing, systematic and widespread - make this investigation necessary and urgent.\" The militant Hamas movement, which controls Gaza, welcomed the decision as \"step forward on the path of achieving justice\", while also defending its actions as \"legitimate resistance\". Campaign group Human Rights Watch said \"all eyes\" would be on incoming prosecutor Karim Khan to \"pick up the baton\", and that \"ICC member countries should stand ready to fiercely protect the court's work from any political pressure\". Ms Bensouda's preliminary examination is believed to have focused on issues such as Israeli military operations in Gaza and the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank - which most of the international community consider illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. When the Palestinians asked to accede to the Rome Statute, they recognised ICC jurisdiction for the purpose of prosecuting alleged perpetrators of crimes from 13 June 2014 onwards. That is one month before a war erupted between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. In the fighting, 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, were killed while on the Israeli side 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed.

The prosecutor also concluded that there was a reasonable basis to believe that in the context of Israel's occupation of the West Bank, members of the Israeli authorities had committed war crimes.

The long-awaited inquiry, which has been fiercely resisted by Israel, follows years of deliberations over whether the ICC has jurisdiction to investigate and is expected to investigate alleged crimes committed by both Israelis and Palestinians. Announcing the investigation, the chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said the court would look into \u201ccrimes within the jurisdiction of the court that are alleged to have been committed\u201d since 13 June 2014. The Gambian lawyer added that the investigation would be conducted \u201cindependently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favor\u201d. If the investigation identifies suspects allegedly responsible for crimes, prosecutors can ask judges to issue international arrest warrants, which can remain under seal to help authorities apprehend those charged. The move, which Palestinians and human rights groups said was long overdue, was immediately condemned by the Israeli foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, as \u201cmorally and legally bankrupt\u201d. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, added: \u201cThe decision of the international court to open an investigation against Israel today for war crimes is absurd. It\u2019s undiluted antisemitism and the height of hypocrisy.\u201d In a videotaped statement, Netanyahu added: \u201cThe state of Israel is under attack this evening. \u201cThe ICC, which was established to prevent a repeat of the horrors the Nazis instigated against the Jewish people, now turns against the state of the Jewish people. Of course it doesn\u2019t say a word against Iran and Syria, and other tyrannical regimes, frequently committing real war crimes,\u201d he said. The announcement follows a 2019 decision that there was \u201creasonable basis\u201d for a war crimes probe, and a ruling on 5 February that the court\u2019s jurisdiction extends to territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 six-day war. That ruling prompted swift rejection from Jerusalem, with Netanyahu condemning the judges\u2019 decision as \u201cpure antisemitism\u201d. Joe Biden\u2019s administration said it disagreed with ICC action against Israel; however, the US is not a party to the ICC. While some Israeli officials have long feared that an ICC investigation was inevitable, the decision sets the stage for one of the court\u2019s most controversial cases. The probe is expected to cover the 2014 Gaza war, the 2018 Gaza border clashes and Israeli settlement-building in the West Bank. The inquiry will also look at whether rocket fire by Hamas and other groups from Gaza amounts to war crimes. \u201cThe decision to open an investigation followed a painstaking preliminary examination undertaken by my office that lasted close to five years,\u201d Bensouda said in a statement. \u201cIn the end, our central concern must be for the victims of crimes \u2013 both Palestinian and Israel \u2013 arising from the long cycle of violence and insecurity that has caused deep suffering and despair on all sides,\u201d she added. \u201cMy office will take the same principled, non-partisan approach that it has adopted in all situations over which its jurisdiction is seized.\u201d As an international court of last resort, the ICC is only empowered to examine cases where it is complained that local jurisdictions have not taken action. While Israel is not a party to the ICC, the Palestinian Authority was accepted after it was ruled that it fulfilled the functions of a state. The Palestinian Authority welcomed Wednesday\u2019s move. \u201cThis long-awaited step serves Palestine\u2019s vigorous effort to achieve justice and accountability as indispensable bases for peace,\u201d the Palestinian foreign ministry said. It called for concluding the investigation quickly because \u201cthe crimes committed by the occupation\u2019s leaders against the Palestinian people are lasting, systematic and far-reaching\u201d. The Palestinians joined the court in 2015 and have long pushed for an investigation. In the past, Israeli officials have accused the court of overstepping its bounds, saying the Palestinians are not an independent sovereign state. Responding to the announcement, the Israeli president, Reuven Rivlin, described it as \u201cscandalous.\u201d \u201cWe will not accept claims against the exercise of our right and our obligation to defend our citizens.

Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, condemned the ruling and said the country would \u201cprotect our citizens and soldiers in every way from legal persecution\u201d. Fatou Bensouda, the ICC chief prosecutor, has previously announced she intends to open a formal inquiry into alleged war crimes in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. However, due to Palestine\u2019s status as an occupied territory rather than a sovereign country, she had waited for judges to \u201cconfirm\u201d if the court, headquartered in The Hague, had the authority. Palestine used its UN observer state status, gained in 2012, to join the ICC and call for an investigation into Israeli actions. Bensouda, a Gambian lawyer, has said she would investigate both the Israeli military as well as Palestinian armed groups, including the Gaza-based Hamas faction, which has been accused of \u201cintentionally directing attacks against civilians\u201d, according to her office. The Palestinian Authority, an internationally recognised representative for Palestinians, still wants to pursue the case. It would see the prosecution of Israeli officials or military figures as a significant diplomatic victory. The authority is also a political rival to Hamas. The Israeli government has argued that as Palestine is not a fully fledged state, it should not be allowed to petition the court. However, in a statement released on Friday, ICC judges announced the court did in fact have jurisdiction. While making clear the court was not taking a stance on any border disputes, the judges said the court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction extended \u201cto the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem\u201d. It rejected Israel\u2019s arguments, stating that Palestine had \u201cthe right to be treated as any other state party\u201d to its statute. Hussein al-Sheikh, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s civil affairs minister, said on Twitter that the ruling was \u201ca victory for rights, justice, freedom and moral values in the world\u201d. Netanyahu attacked the decision. \u201cToday the ICC proved once again that it is a political body and not a judicial institution,\u201d he said, adding that Israel was not a member of the ICC. While Israel has not signed up to the international treaty, the ICC\u2019s mandate is to prosecute people, not countries, including those from states that are not signatories. Netanyahu has previously called for sanctions against the court and people who work for it. Donald Trump\u2019s administration used a similar tactic to block a separate abandoned ICC investigation into the conduct of US troops in Afghanistan. While Joe Biden\u2019s administration says it disagrees with ICC action against Israel, it says it is reviewing those sanctions, a move that worries Israel. However, US state department spokesman Ned Price said Washington had \u201cserious concerns\u201d over Friday\u2019s ICC ruling. It was not clear if Netanyahu also intends to block ICC officials from entering the Palestinian Territories, which could hamper its work because Israel controls access to the West Bank and Jerusalem. Bensouda has said she intends to investigate incidents that occurred during the 2014 Gaza war between Israel and Hamas. The case could also be expanded to include the alleged killings by Israeli soldiers of more than 200 Palestinians, including more than 40 children, at demonstrations along the Gaza frontier. Separately, Bensouda argued there was a \u201creasonable basis\u201d to believe that Israeli authorities had committed war crimes by moving Israeli civilians into the West Bank to live in settlements. Under the Geneva convention, signed after the second world war, the transfer of civilians into occupied land is prohibited.\n\nquestion: Who praised the decision?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Hussein al-Sheikh, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s civil affairs minister", "usage": 841}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled it has jurisdiction over the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, paving the way for the tribunal\u2019s prosecutor to open a war crimes investigation. Judges said on Friday their decision was based on jurisdictional rules in The Hague-based court\u2019s founding documents and does not imply any attempt to determine statehood or legal borders. \u201cThe Court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction in the Situation in Palestine \u2026 extends to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,\u201d they said. Israel, which is not a member of the court, has rejected its jurisdiction. The court\u2019s prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said in December 2019 there was \u201ca reasonable basis to believe that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip\u201d. Bensouda named the Israeli army and armed Palestinian groups such as Hamas as possible perpetrators. She asked judges to rule on whether the situation fell under the court\u2019s jurisdiction, before a formal investigation would be opened. In a majority ruling published on Friday, the judges said yes. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh praised the ICC for its ruling. \u201cThis decision  is a victory for justice and humanity, for the values of truth, fairness and freedom, and for the blood of the victims and their families,\u201d Shtayyeh said, according to the official Wafa news agency. Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas official, described the decision as \u201can important development that contributes in protecting the Palestinian people\u201d. \u201cWe urge the international court to launch an investigation into Israeli war crimes against the Palestinian people,\u201d said Abu Zuhri, who is currently outside Gaza. Israel and the United States reacted with furious condemnation of the court when the prosecutor made the announcement.

The administration of then-US President Donald Trump slapped sanctions on the prosecutor and another senior ICC official in September. The United States, which is not a member of the ICC, inflicted the measures on the court after earlier visa bans on Bensouda and others failed to head off the court\u2019s war crimes probe into US military personnel in Afghanistan. The Palestinians have asked the court to look into Israeli actions during its 2014 assault against Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip, as well as Israel\u2019s construction of settlements in the occupied West Bank and annexed East Jerusalem.

Fatou Bensouda said the probe would cover events in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip since June 2014. Last month, the Hague-based court ruled that it could exercise its criminal jurisdiction over the territories. Israel rejected Ms Bensouda's decision, while Palestinian officials praised it. The US expressed disappointment and opposition to the move. The ICC has the authority to prosecute those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes on the territory of states party to the Rome Statute, its founding treaty. Israel has never ratified the Rome Statute, but the court ruled that it had jurisdiction because the United Nations secretary general accepted the Palestinians' accession to the treaty in 2015. Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians claim the territories for a future independent state. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Ms Bensouda explained that her office was obliged to act \"where a state party has referred a situation\" to it and \"it is determined that a reasonable basis exists to commence an investigation\". Ms Bensouda said she had carried out a \"painstaking preliminary examination\" that lasted close to five years and promised that the investigation would be conducted independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favour. \"We have no agenda other than to meet our statutory duties under the Rome Statute with professional integrity,\" she said, noting that she had declined to investigate the 2010 killing by Israeli troops of 10 Turkish activists on the Gaza-bound ship Mavi Marmara. \"In the current situation, however, there is a reasonable basis to proceed and there are admissible potential cases,\" she added. Ms Bensouda, who will be succeeded by British prosecutor Karim Khan in June, also stressed that the \"central concern must be for the victims of crimes, both Palestinian and Israeli, arising from the long cycle of violence and insecurity that has caused deep suffering and despair on all sides\". The prosecutor's decision came moments before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's glitzy online election campaign launch. He used the stage to give an excoriating response, saying the probe was an anti-Semitic attack on the only Jewish state. This approach will continue in public - to undermine the court itself. Behind the scenes though, concerned officials are working to offset, delay and limit its impact. They will try to show that Israel can investigate itself and that an outgoing prosecutor is tying her successor's hands. They will roll out a plan - understood to be no-expense-spared - to minimise the chance of any future arrest of officers or politicians abroad. Israel's defence minister has acknowledged that \"hundreds\", including himself, could be at risk, adding: \"We will take care of everybody.\" And they will rely on the US and other allies for backing. But the level of rhetoric suggests Israel's leadership feels increasingly worried by the progress of the case. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the ICC's decision was \"the essence of anti-Semitism and the essence of hypocrisy.\" \"It found that our brave and moral soldiers, who are fighting the most brutal terrorists on earth, are, of all people, war criminals.\" \"The court, which was established to prevent a recurrence of the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis against the Jewish people, is now turning against the state of the Jewish people,\" he asserted. US State Department spokesman Ned Price criticised the decision. \"We firmly oppose and are disappointed by the ICC prosecutor's announcement of an investigation into the Palestinian situation,\" he said, adding the US \"will continue to uphold our strong commitment to Israel and its security including by opposing actions that seek to target Israel unfairly\". Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said: \"The crimes committed by the leaders of the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian people - which are ongoing, systematic and widespread - make this investigation necessary and urgent.\" The militant Hamas movement, which controls Gaza, welcomed the decision as \"step forward on the path of achieving justice\", while also defending its actions as \"legitimate resistance\". Campaign group Human Rights Watch said \"all eyes\" would be on incoming prosecutor Karim Khan to \"pick up the baton\", and that \"ICC member countries should stand ready to fiercely protect the court's work from any political pressure\". Ms Bensouda's preliminary examination is believed to have focused on issues such as Israeli military operations in Gaza and the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank - which most of the international community consider illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. When the Palestinians asked to accede to the Rome Statute, they recognised ICC jurisdiction for the purpose of prosecuting alleged perpetrators of crimes from 13 June 2014 onwards. That is one month before a war erupted between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. In the fighting, 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, were killed while on the Israeli side 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed.

The long-awaited inquiry, which has been fiercely resisted by Israel, follows years of deliberations over whether the ICC has jurisdiction to investigate and is expected to investigate alleged crimes committed by both Israelis and Palestinians. Announcing the investigation, the chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said the court would look into \u201ccrimes within the jurisdiction of the court that are alleged to have been committed\u201d since 13 June 2014. The Gambian lawyer added that the investigation would be conducted \u201cindependently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favor\u201d. If the investigation identifies suspects allegedly responsible for crimes, prosecutors can ask judges to issue international arrest warrants, which can remain under seal to help authorities apprehend those charged. The move, which Palestinians and human rights groups said was long overdue, was immediately condemned by the Israeli foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, as \u201cmorally and legally bankrupt\u201d. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, added: \u201cThe decision of the international court to open an investigation against Israel today for war crimes is absurd. It\u2019s undiluted antisemitism and the height of hypocrisy.\u201d In a videotaped statement, Netanyahu added: \u201cThe state of Israel is under attack this evening. \u201cThe ICC, which was established to prevent a repeat of the horrors the Nazis instigated against the Jewish people, now turns against the state of the Jewish people. Of course it doesn\u2019t say a word against Iran and Syria, and other tyrannical regimes, frequently committing real war crimes,\u201d he said. The announcement follows a 2019 decision that there was \u201creasonable basis\u201d for a war crimes probe, and a ruling on 5 February that the court\u2019s jurisdiction extends to territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 six-day war. That ruling prompted swift rejection from Jerusalem, with Netanyahu condemning the judges\u2019 decision as \u201cpure antisemitism\u201d. Joe Biden\u2019s administration said it disagreed with ICC action against Israel; however, the US is not a party to the ICC. While some Israeli officials have long feared that an ICC investigation was inevitable, the decision sets the stage for one of the court\u2019s most controversial cases. The probe is expected to cover the 2014 Gaza war, the 2018 Gaza border clashes and Israeli settlement-building in the West Bank. The inquiry will also look at whether rocket fire by Hamas and other groups from Gaza amounts to war crimes. \u201cThe decision to open an investigation followed a painstaking preliminary examination undertaken by my office that lasted close to five years,\u201d Bensouda said in a statement. \u201cIn the end, our central concern must be for the victims of crimes \u2013 both Palestinian and Israel \u2013 arising from the long cycle of violence and insecurity that has caused deep suffering and despair on all sides,\u201d she added. \u201cMy office will take the same principled, non-partisan approach that it has adopted in all situations over which its jurisdiction is seized.\u201d As an international court of last resort, the ICC is only empowered to examine cases where it is complained that local jurisdictions have not taken action. While Israel is not a party to the ICC, the Palestinian Authority was accepted after it was ruled that it fulfilled the functions of a state. The Palestinian Authority welcomed Wednesday\u2019s move. \u201cThis long-awaited step serves Palestine\u2019s vigorous effort to achieve justice and accountability as indispensable bases for peace,\u201d the Palestinian foreign ministry said. It called for concluding the investigation quickly because \u201cthe crimes committed by the occupation\u2019s leaders against the Palestinian people are lasting, systematic and far-reaching\u201d. The Palestinians joined the court in 2015 and have long pushed for an investigation. In the past, Israeli officials have accused the court of overstepping its bounds, saying the Palestinians are not an independent sovereign state. Responding to the announcement, the Israeli president, Reuven Rivlin, described it as \u201cscandalous.\u201d \u201cWe will not accept claims against the exercise of our right and our obligation to defend our citizens. The state of Israel is a strong, Jewish and democratic state which knows how to defend itself and to investigate itself when necessary. \u201cWe are proud of our soldiers, our sons and daughters, the essence of our people, who stand guard for their country generation after generation, a defensive wall against all those who seek our harm.\u201d The investigation will probably also look into alleged crimes by Palestinian militants.

Israel has never ratified the Rome Statute, but the court ruled that it had jurisdiction because the United Nations secretary general accepted the Palestinians' accession to the treaty in 2015. Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians claim the territories for a future independent state. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Ms Bensouda explained that her office was obliged to act \"where a state party has referred a situation\" to it and \"it is determined that a reasonable basis exists to commence an investigation\". Ms Bensouda said she had carried out a \"painstaking preliminary examination\" that lasted close to five years and promised that the investigation would be conducted independently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favour. \"We have no agenda other than to meet our statutory duties under the Rome Statute with professional integrity,\" she said, noting that she had declined to investigate the 2010 killing by Israeli troops of 10 Turkish activists on the Gaza-bound ship Mavi Marmara. \"In the current situation, however, there is a reasonable basis to proceed and there are admissible potential cases,\" she added. Ms Bensouda, who will be succeeded by British prosecutor Karim Khan in June, also stressed that the \"central concern must be for the victims of crimes, both Palestinian and Israeli, arising from the long cycle of violence and insecurity that has caused deep suffering and despair on all sides\". The prosecutor's decision came moments before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's glitzy online election campaign launch. He used the stage to give an excoriating response, saying the probe was an anti-Semitic attack on the only Jewish state. This approach will continue in public - to undermine the court itself. Behind the scenes though, concerned officials are working to offset, delay and limit its impact. They will try to show that Israel can investigate itself and that an outgoing prosecutor is tying her successor's hands. They will roll out a plan - understood to be no-expense-spared - to minimise the chance of any future arrest of officers or politicians abroad. Israel's defence minister has acknowledged that \"hundreds\", including himself, could be at risk, adding: \"We will take care of everybody.\" And they will rely on the US and other allies for backing. But the level of rhetoric suggests Israel's leadership feels increasingly worried by the progress of the case. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the ICC's decision was \"the essence of anti-Semitism and the essence of hypocrisy.\" \"It found that our brave and moral soldiers, who are fighting the most brutal terrorists on earth, are, of all people, war criminals.\" \"The court, which was established to prevent a recurrence of the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis against the Jewish people, is now turning against the state of the Jewish people,\" he asserted. US State Department spokesman Ned Price criticised the decision. \"We firmly oppose and are disappointed by the ICC prosecutor's announcement of an investigation into the Palestinian situation,\" he said, adding the US \"will continue to uphold our strong commitment to Israel and its security including by opposing actions that seek to target Israel unfairly\". Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said: \"The crimes committed by the leaders of the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian people - which are ongoing, systematic and widespread - make this investigation necessary and urgent.\" The militant Hamas movement, which controls Gaza, welcomed the decision as \"step forward on the path of achieving justice\", while also defending its actions as \"legitimate resistance\". Campaign group Human Rights Watch said \"all eyes\" would be on incoming prosecutor Karim Khan to \"pick up the baton\", and that \"ICC member countries should stand ready to fiercely protect the court's work from any political pressure\". Ms Bensouda's preliminary examination is believed to have focused on issues such as Israeli military operations in Gaza and the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank - which most of the international community consider illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. When the Palestinians asked to accede to the Rome Statute, they recognised ICC jurisdiction for the purpose of prosecuting alleged perpetrators of crimes from 13 June 2014 onwards. That is one month before a war erupted between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza. In the fighting, 2,251 Palestinians, including 1,462 civilians, were killed while on the Israeli side 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed.

The long-awaited inquiry, which has been fiercely resisted by Israel, follows years of deliberations over whether the ICC has jurisdiction to investigate and is expected to investigate alleged crimes committed by both Israelis and Palestinians. Announcing the investigation, the chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said the court would look into \u201ccrimes within the jurisdiction of the court that are alleged to have been committed\u201d since 13 June 2014. The Gambian lawyer added that the investigation would be conducted \u201cindependently, impartially and objectively, without fear or favor\u201d. If the investigation identifies suspects allegedly responsible for crimes, prosecutors can ask judges to issue international arrest warrants, which can remain under seal to help authorities apprehend those charged. The move, which Palestinians and human rights groups said was long overdue, was immediately condemned by the Israeli foreign minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, as \u201cmorally and legally bankrupt\u201d. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, added: \u201cThe decision of the international court to open an investigation against Israel today for war crimes is absurd. It\u2019s undiluted antisemitism and the height of hypocrisy.\u201d In a videotaped statement, Netanyahu added: \u201cThe state of Israel is under attack this evening. \u201cThe ICC, which was established to prevent a repeat of the horrors the Nazis instigated against the Jewish people, now turns against the state of the Jewish people. Of course it doesn\u2019t say a word against Iran and Syria, and other tyrannical regimes, frequently committing real war crimes,\u201d he said. The announcement follows a 2019 decision that there was \u201creasonable basis\u201d for a war crimes probe, and a ruling on 5 February that the court\u2019s jurisdiction extends to territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 six-day war. That ruling prompted swift rejection from Jerusalem, with Netanyahu condemning the judges\u2019 decision as \u201cpure antisemitism\u201d. Joe Biden\u2019s administration said it disagreed with ICC action against Israel; however, the US is not a party to the ICC. While some Israeli officials have long feared that an ICC investigation was inevitable, the decision sets the stage for one of the court\u2019s most controversial cases. The probe is expected to cover the 2014 Gaza war, the 2018 Gaza border clashes and Israeli settlement-building in the West Bank. The inquiry will also look at whether rocket fire by Hamas and other groups from Gaza amounts to war crimes. \u201cThe decision to open an investigation followed a painstaking preliminary examination undertaken by my office that lasted close to five years,\u201d Bensouda said in a statement. \u201cIn the end, our central concern must be for the victims of crimes \u2013 both Palestinian and Israel \u2013 arising from the long cycle of violence and insecurity that has caused deep suffering and despair on all sides,\u201d she added. \u201cMy office will take the same principled, non-partisan approach that it has adopted in all situations over which its jurisdiction is seized.\u201d As an international court of last resort, the ICC is only empowered to examine cases where it is complained that local jurisdictions have not taken action. While Israel is not a party to the ICC, the Palestinian Authority was accepted after it was ruled that it fulfilled the functions of a state. The Palestinian Authority welcomed Wednesday\u2019s move. \u201cThis long-awaited step serves Palestine\u2019s vigorous effort to achieve justice and accountability as indispensable bases for peace,\u201d the Palestinian foreign ministry said. It called for concluding the investigation quickly because \u201cthe crimes committed by the occupation\u2019s leaders against the Palestinian people are lasting, systematic and far-reaching\u201d. The Palestinians joined the court in 2015 and have long pushed for an investigation. In the past, Israeli officials have accused the court of overstepping its bounds, saying the Palestinians are not an independent sovereign state. Responding to the announcement, the Israeli president, Reuven Rivlin, described it as \u201cscandalous.\u201d \u201cWe will not accept claims against the exercise of our right and our obligation to defend our citizens. The state of Israel is a strong, Jewish and democratic state which knows how to defend itself and to investigate itself when necessary. \u201cWe are proud of our soldiers, our sons and daughters, the essence of our people, who stand guard for their country generation after generation, a defensive wall against all those who seek our harm.\u201d The investigation will probably also look into alleged crimes by Palestinian militants. Bensouda has said her probe would examine the actions of Hamas, which fired rockets into Israel during the 2014 war. Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza, told Reuters: \u201cWe welcome the\n\nquestion: What territories will the investigation cover?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "the 2014 Gaza war, the 2018 Gaza border clashes and Israeli settlement-building in the West Bank.", "usage": 1085}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, condemned the ruling and said the country would \u201cprotect our citizens and soldiers in every way from legal persecution\u201d. Fatou Bensouda, the ICC chief prosecutor, has previously announced she intends to open a formal inquiry into alleged war crimes in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. However, due to Palestine\u2019s status as an occupied territory rather than a sovereign country, she had waited for judges to \u201cconfirm\u201d if the court, headquartered in The Hague, had the authority. Palestine used its UN observer state status, gained in 2012, to join the ICC and call for an investigation into Israeli actions. Bensouda, a Gambian lawyer, has said she would investigate both the Israeli military as well as Palestinian armed groups, including the Gaza-based Hamas faction, which has been accused of \u201cintentionally directing attacks against civilians\u201d, according to her office. The Palestinian Authority, an internationally recognised representative for Palestinians, still wants to pursue the case. It would see the prosecution of Israeli officials or military figures as a significant diplomatic victory. The authority is also a political rival to Hamas. The Israeli government has argued that as Palestine is not a fully fledged state, it should not be allowed to petition the court. However, in a statement released on Friday, ICC judges announced the court did in fact have jurisdiction. While making clear the court was not taking a stance on any border disputes, the judges said the court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction extended \u201cto the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem\u201d. It rejected Israel\u2019s arguments, stating that Palestine had \u201cthe right to be treated as any other state party\u201d to its statute. Hussein al-Sheikh, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s civil affairs minister, said on Twitter that the ruling was \u201ca victory for rights, justice, freedom and moral values in the world\u201d. Netanyahu attacked the decision. \u201cToday the ICC proved once again that it is a political body and not a judicial institution,\u201d he said, adding that Israel was not a member of the ICC. While Israel has not signed up to the international treaty, the ICC\u2019s mandate is to prosecute people, not countries, including those from states that are not signatories. Netanyahu has previously called for sanctions against the court and people who work for it. Donald Trump\u2019s administration used a similar tactic to block a separate abandoned ICC investigation into the conduct of US troops in Afghanistan. While Joe Biden\u2019s administration says it disagrees with ICC action against Israel, it says it is reviewing those sanctions, a move that worries Israel. However, US state department spokesman Ned Price said Washington had \u201cserious concerns\u201d over Friday\u2019s ICC ruling. It was not clear if Netanyahu also intends to block ICC officials from entering the Palestinian Territories, which could hamper its work because Israel controls access to the West Bank and Jerusalem. Bensouda has said she intends to investigate incidents that occurred during the 2014 Gaza war between Israel and Hamas. The case could also be expanded to include the alleged killings by Israeli soldiers of more than 200 Palestinians, including more than 40 children, at demonstrations along the Gaza frontier. Separately, Bensouda argued there was a \u201creasonable basis\u201d to believe that Israeli authorities had committed war crimes by moving Israeli civilians into the West Bank to live in settlements. Under the Geneva convention, signed after the second world war, the transfer of civilians into occupied land is prohibited.\n\nquestion: What territories will the investigation cover?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.", "usage": 839}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled it has jurisdiction over the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, paving the way for the tribunal\u2019s prosecutor to open a war crimes investigation. Judges said on Friday their decision was based on jurisdictional rules in The Hague-based court\u2019s founding documents and does not imply any attempt to determine statehood or legal borders. \u201cThe Court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction in the Situation in Palestine \u2026 extends to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,\u201d they said. Israel, which is not a member of the court, has rejected its jurisdiction. The court\u2019s prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said in December 2019 there was \u201ca reasonable basis to believe that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip\u201d. Bensouda named the Israeli army and armed Palestinian groups such as Hamas as possible perpetrators. She asked judges to rule on whether the situation fell under the court\u2019s jurisdiction, before a formal investigation would be opened. In a majority ruling published on Friday, the judges said yes. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh praised the ICC for its ruling. \u201cThis decision  is a victory for justice and humanity, for the values of truth, fairness and freedom, and for the blood of the victims and their families,\u201d Shtayyeh said, according to the official Wafa news agency. Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas official, described the decision as \u201can important development that contributes in protecting the Palestinian people\u201d. \u201cWe urge the international court to launch an investigation into Israeli war crimes against the Palestinian people,\u201d said Abu Zuhri, who is currently outside Gaza. Israel and the United States reacted with furious condemnation of the court when the prosecutor made the announcement. Israel accused the International Criminal Court of \u201cpure anti-Semitism\u201d after it announced its jurisdiction extends to territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. \u201cWhen the ICC investigates Israel for fake war crimes, this is pure anti-Semitism,\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded statement. \u201cThe court established to prevent atrocities like the Nazi Holocaust against the Jewish people is now targeting the one state of the Jewish people.\u201d He also accused the court of having a double standard. \u201cThe ICC refuses to investigate brutal dictatorships like Iran and Syria, who commit horrific atrocities almost daily,\u201d he said. \u201cI assure you we will fight this perversion of justice with all our might.\u201d The US said it has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the ICC\u2019s effort to assert jurisdiction over Israeli personnel in the Palestinian territories, state department spokesman Ned Price said, adding the US government was reviewing the ruling. The administration of then-US President Donald Trump slapped sanctions on the prosecutor and another senior ICC official in September. The United States, which is not a member of the ICC, inflicted the measures on the court after earlier visa bans on Bensouda and others failed to head off the court\u2019s war crimes probe into US military personnel in Afghanistan. The Palestinians have asked the court to look into Israeli actions during its 2014 assault against Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip, as well as Israel\u2019s construction of settlements in the occupied West Bank and annexed East Jerusalem. The international community widely considers the settlements to be illegal under international law.
