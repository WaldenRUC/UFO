Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that \"so far no videos were used in the crash investigation.\" He added, \"A person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators.\" Robin's comments follow claims by two magazines, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board Germanwings Flight 9525 as it crashed into the French Alps. All 150 on board were killed. Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site. The two publications described the supposed video, but did not post it on their websites. The publications said that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. \"One can hear cries of 'My God' in several languages,\" Paris Match reported. \"Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object.  Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing.\" \"It is a very disturbing scene,\" said Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online. An official with France's accident investigation agency, the BEA, said the agency is not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the reports were \"completely wrong\" and \"unwarranted.\" Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but that they \"hadn't been exploited yet.\" Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny sous-Bois, near Paris, in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute, Menichini said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media, Menichini answered with a categorical \"no.\" Reichelt told \"Erin Burnett: Outfront\" that he had watched the video and stood by the report, saying Bild and Paris Match are \"very confident\" that the clip is real. He noted that investigators only revealed they'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports. \"That is something we did not know before.... Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren't revealed by the investigation at the beginning,\" he said. What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot? German airline Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525, which he's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the French Alps. Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a \"previous episode of severe depression,\" the airline said Tuesday. Email correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation, Lufthansa said, included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training. The announcement indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz's battle with depression, allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit. Lufthansa, whose CEO Carsten Spohr previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a \"swift and seamless clarification\" and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors. Spohr traveled to the crash site Wednesday, where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside. He saw the crisis center set up in Seyne-les-Alpes, laid a wreath in the village of Le Vernet, closer to the crash site, where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial. Menichini told CNN late Tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching. French President Francois Hollande, speaking Tuesday, said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week, sooner than authorities had previously suggested. In the meantime, the recovery of the victims' personal belongings will start Wednesday, Menichini said. Among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board. Check out the latest from our correspondents. The details about Lubitz's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz's possible motive for downing the jet.

Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash. Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license, a European government official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Tuesday. While flying was \"a big part of his life,\" the source said, it's only one theory being considered. Another source, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, also told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems. Lubitz's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist, both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues, the European government official said. But no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles, there's more to the story, said Brian Russell, a forensic psychologist. \"Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they weren't going to keep doing their job and they're upset about that and so they're suicidal,\" he said. \"But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person's problems.\" Germanwings crash compensation: What we know.

Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren't revealed by the investigation at the beginning,\" he said. What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot? German airline Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525, which he's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the French Alps. Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a \"previous episode of severe depression,\" the airline said Tuesday. Email correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation, Lufthansa said, included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training. The announcement indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz's battle with depression, allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit. Lufthansa, whose CEO Carsten Spohr previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a \"swift and seamless clarification\" and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors. Spohr traveled to the crash site Wednesday, where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside. He saw the crisis center set up in Seyne-les-Alpes, laid a wreath in the village of Le Vernet, closer to the crash site, where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial. Menichini told CNN late Tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching. French President Francois Hollande, speaking Tuesday, said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week, sooner than authorities had previously suggested. In the meantime, the recovery of the victims' personal belongings will start Wednesday, Menichini said. Among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board. Check out the latest from our correspondents. The details about Lubitz's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz's possible motive for downing the jet.

Another source, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, also told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems. Lubitz's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist, both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues, the European government official said.

Meanwhile, French investigative newspaper Le Canard Enchaine reported Wednesday that the Gendarmerie Nationale, or National Police, had questioned Remy Jouty, the head of the BEA, regarding leaks in the investigation \u2013 specifically a report in The New York Times about the contents of the cockpit voice recorder. BEA spokeswoman Martine Del Bono confirmed to CNN that the Gendarmerie Nationale questioned Jouty regarding the Germanwings investigation but refused to elaborate. She said he was questioned on the evening of March 25. That same day, The New York Times reported that the Germanwings pilot was locked out of the cockpit just before the crash. \u201cAn investigator said evidence from a cockpit voice recorder indicated one pilot left the cockpit before the plane\u2019s descent and was unable to get back in,\u201d reporter Nicola Clark wrote. Wednesday\u2019s article in Le Canard Enchain\u00e9, citing a government source, said: \u201cThey (the Gendarmerie) reproached him (Jouty) for not informing the Prosecutor first regarding the content of the cockpit voice recorder. \u201cThe Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, in charge of the investigation and the Gendarmerie found out about the cockpit voice recorder content in \u2026 the press!\u201d said Le Canard Enchain\u00e9. Separately, the French National Union of Airline Pilots confirmed that it had filed a complaint against a person it identified merely as \u201cX\u201d last week for breach of confidentiality after \u201ca source close to the investigation\u201d leaked information to The New York Times. \u201cThe article states that the source is a high official part of the team of investigators and that he had access to audio recordings from the recorder,\u201d the union\u2019s statement said.

He first took to the skies as a member of a gliding club in his hometown of Montabaur in west Germany before fulfilling his ambition of becoming a professional pilot. Friends and neighbours described him as a \"quiet\" but \"fun\" character, who enjoyed his job. A picture from his now defunct Facebook page shows him smiling happily in front of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In the aftermath of the disaster, investigators have established a very different side to his character. Police found torn-up sick notes in his homes, including one covering the day of the crash. Despite assertions from friends that he was in good spirits, the final report on the crash by French investigators found he had suffered from a psychiatric condition and had been taking medication before the crash. Fearing he was losing his vision, he had hidden the evidence from his employer. The Bild newspaper also reported that he may have been going through a \"personal life crisis\" at the time of the crash. Lsubitz lived at his parents' home in Montabaur, a town near Frankfurt of about 12,500 people. His father Guenther worked in banking and his mother was a church organist. He was about 14 when he joined the LSC Westerwald glider club in Montabaur, where he learned to fly in a sleek white ASK-21 two-seater and went on to obtain his full licence, according to club chairman Klaus Radke. He was also a keen runner, competing in several races. In 2007, he graduated from high school and was accepted as a Lufthansa trainee the following year, enrolling at the company's training school in Bremen. Lubitz had a break in training about six years ago, lasting several months, according to Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr. Mr Spohr refused to disclose the reason for this gap but said his suitability had been reassessed and Lubitz had resumed his studies. But the final report of the investigation into the crash finds the interruption was caused by medical problems. He suffered a serious depressive episode during his treatment and went on to receive treatment for a year and a half. During that time, he considered suicide but was eventually declared healthy. It was recommended by a doctor that he needed special regular medical inspection and his medical certificates were valid for only one year at a time. A relevant note was added to his aviation authority file as well as to his pilot's licence. In 2013 he joined Lufthansa's low budget airline, Germanwings. He initially worked as a flight attendant before starting his role as co-pilot. His duties would have included monitoring instruments, communicating with air traffic controllers and sharing control of the aircraft with the captain. He would have also been expected to steer the plane during the pilot's breaks, or if he or she became ill. Lufthansa said Lubitz had flown a total of 630 hours before the fatal crash. He underwent a regular security check on 27 January and nothing untoward was found. Previous security checks in 2008 and 2010 also showed no issues. \"He was 100% fit to fly without any restrictions or conditions,\" Mr Spohr said. Yet the crash investigation found differently. He had battled with vision problems and insomnia for several months, it said, caused by a psychiatric disorder rather than anything physical. He was taking medication for both psychiatric issues and insomnia, and had been given doctor's notes excusing him from work. But he never showed them to the airline. \"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode and was taking psychotropic medication,\" the report found. \"This made him unfit to fly.\" But the report found he had hidden the evidence, and neither the airline nor his colleagues could have known about his circumstances. Those who knew Lubitz have described him as an affable young man, who gave no indications he was harbouring any harmful intent. This video can not be played Members of the flight club where Andreas Lubitz was a member have been talking about his personality Klaus Radke told the Associated Press that he had seen him when he returned to the club to renew his glider licence in the autumn of 2014. \"He seemed very enthusiastic about his career,\" he said. \"I can't remember anything where something wasn't right.\" Peter Ruecker, a long-time member of club, also insisted Lubitz had seemed \"very happy\" during their last meeting. \"I'm just speechless,\" he said. \"I don't have any explanation for this. Knowing Andreas, this is just inconceivable for me.\" A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet.

The discovery of the bodies came about 24 hours after the blast brought down the four-storey building in the Mediterranean port city in southern France. Emergency workers had continued rescue operations through Sunday night into the early hours of Monday with the help of a crane and lights, but a persistent fire underneath the rubble hampered their work, making it difficult for firefighters to deploy sniffer dogs. \u201cGiven the particular difficulties of intervention, the extraction  will take time,\u201d the fire department said in a statement announcing the bodies had been found. \u201cThe judicial authority will then proceed to identify\u201d the victims, it added. Earlier on Sunday, before the discovery of the bodies, local prosecutor Dominique Laurens said eight people \u201cwere not responding to phone calls\u201d. Five people from neighbouring buildings sustained minor injuries in the blast and collapse, which occurred abot 1.40am on Sunday local time. \u201cTonight, the pain and sorrow are great,\u201d Marseille\u2019s mayor, Benoit Payan, said in a statement. \u201cAll services of the city, as well as the state, are still at this very moment fully committed to continue the search.\u201d The cause of the explosion is still to be determined, but investigators are looking at the possibility it was the result of a gas leak. More than 100 firefighters were battling the blaze in the ruins of the building, which was believed to have one apartment on each floor. \u201cWe have nothing, not even an ID card. We have lost everything,\u201d said a man who gave his name as Roland in an interview with local newspaper La Provence. He managed to get out of the building on 15 Rue de Tivoli with his wife and two children before it collapsed, together with a neighbouring building, after the explosion around 12.40am local time. A third building partly collapsed. Five people were taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. The interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, who visited the site, said 30 buildings in the area were evacuated. Saveria Mosnier, who lives in a street near the site in the La Plaine neighbourhood, said: \u201cI was sleeping and there was this huge blast that really shook the room. I was shocked awake as if I had been dreaming. \u201cWe very quickly smelled a strong gas odour that hung around. We could still smell it this morning.\u201d It was unclear how many people were inside the collapsed buildings. \u201cNot all the people who were supposedly inside \u2026 have been seen. Families are worried,\u201d the French housing minister, Olivier Klein, told the broadcaster Franceinfo. Christophe Mirmand, the prefect of the southern Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne region, said: \u201cWe have to be very cautious about what the cause was at this stage.\u201d Gas was \u201cone possible option\u201d. Gilles, who lives on a sidestreet near the building, told AFP the sound of the crash \u201cwas huge\u201d. \u201cIt sounded like an explosion,\u201d he said, declining to provide his last name. Almost 200 residents were evacuated and 50 requested to be urgently rehoused. An aid centre for people looking for missing family members or loved ones has been opened in a neighbouring district. Eight were killed in Marseille in 2018 when two dilapidated buildings in the working-class district of Noailles caved in. It cast a harsh light on the city\u2019s housing standards, with aid groups saying 40,000 people live in shoddy structures. But authorities appeared to rule out structural issues in the latest collapse, in a neighbourhood known for its bars and nightlife. \u201cThere was no danger notice for this building, and it is not in a neighbourhood identified as having substandard housing,\u201d said Mirmand. Further back in Marseille\u2019s history, eight people were killed in a building collapse in 1981, five in an explosion in 1985, and four in a 1996 gas blast that demolished a seven-storey building.

A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet. The final accident report by the French authorities answered many questions - but some are still a mystery. Investigators ruled out terrorism early on and their position did not change when it was revealed that they believed Lubitz had deliberately crashed the aircraft. That was upheld in the final report, which found that he had been suffering from psychiatric issues he had hidden from his colleagues. The co-pilot did not behave in a peculiar or extreme manner and people who knew him expressed shock over the event. \"He's not the type of guy who would try and kill other people - absolutely not,\" a neighbour said. \"He was really just a very normal, not very remarkable, nice young man,\" said Klaus Radke, the president of the club near Montabaur in Germany where Lubitz had learned to fly. Lubitz had battled depression before, suspending his training for medical reasons in 2008. The final crash investigation report detailed his medical history and showed he had started to suffer from a \"severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms\". During that period, he considered suicide and \"made several 'no suicide pacts' with his treating psychiatrist and was hospitalised\", the report says. In April 2009, his medical certificate was not revalidated \"due to depression and the taking of medication to treat it\". In July that year, he was declared \"entirely healthy\" and given a one-year medical certificate, with a note that it must be renewed each year. It was renewed annually without incident until December 2014. It was then that Lubitz consulted doctors about \"vision problems and sleep disorders\" but eye specialists could not find a physical cause. Instead, investigators say, he was diagnosed with a \"psychosomatic disorder\" - a physical illness caused by a mental factor. In February 2015, he was given a sick certificate for eight days, which he did not forward to the airline. Over the next month, he would be issued several more medical certificates, none of which his employer saw; was prescribed insomnia and antidepressant medication; and was referred \"for psychiatric hospital treatment due to a possible psychosis\". Traces of the medications were found in his remains during a post-mortem toxicology exam. \"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode, and was taking psychotropic medication,\" the report found. \"This made him unfit to fly.\" Prosecutors in Duesseldorf at the time of the crash found torn-up sick notes, including for the day of the crash. In April 2015, German prosecutors said Lubitz had researched \"ways to commit suicide\" on his tablet at home in the week before the crash. Another of his internet searches was for \"cockpit doors and their security provisions\". The German tabloid paper Bild said (in German) it had seen documents that said he was suffering from a \"personal life crisis\", having recently broken up with a girlfriend. But even when we have a fuller picture of Lubitz's state of mind before the crash, some of his actions may remain a mystery forever. For example, after he had decided to kill himself and everyone else on board the plane, why did he set the aircraft on a controlled, rather than a sudden, descent? Depression is a serious illness, and it affects everyone differently. People experiencing depression can reach such a state of alienation that they risk taking their lives - but the vast majority of people with depression would never harm anyone other than themselves. Writing in the Times, Jennifer Wild, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, has said that the irrational thinking evident from Lubitz's actions in the cockpit may have been triggered by depression, possibly caused by a recent traumatic episode. \"Perhaps in his state he did not consider the consequences of his actions, or perhaps he did not care because he was consumed with ending his life,\" she wrote, adding that drug-taking or a bout of extreme anger might also explain his actions. The black box recording of Lubitz's calm breathing as he pressed the controls to send the aeroplane hurtling to the ground may lead some to believe he was a psychopath but Dr Wild notes that psychopaths generally avoid harming themselves. Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that millions of people in Britain suffered from depression, which is a treatable illness. He told the BBC that this included pilots who \"resume flying, perfectly safely, for maybe tens of years afterwards\". The fact that Lubitz appears to have been signed off as sick raises the question of whether there was - or should have been - contact between his doctors and the airline. Medical practitioners take an oath to maintain patient confidentiality but some US states have expanded doctors' duty of care to the community at large.

In Germany, trainee pilots are subjected to medical examinations which include oral psychological assessments. There is some debate as to whether such assessments are thorough enough. One question an examiner might ask a pilot is, \"Do you have a butterfly collection at home?\", the Suddeitsche Zeitung reported (in German). At the time of the crash, Lufthansa said that after they hired pilots they did not subject them to regular psychological examinations. This is obligatory in other countries, such as the US and UK. Airline staff are encouraged to report strange behaviour on the part of their colleagues but a former pilot told the BBC that peer pressure could act as a brake on this process. And Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa's chief, admitted: \"All the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case.\" But Mr Spohr also said: \"No matter your safety regulations, no matter how high you set the bar, and we have incredibly high standards, there is no way to rule out such an event. This is an awful one-off event.\" Aircraft-assisted pilot suicides are rare. A 2014 study by the Federal Aviation Authority identified eight such instances in the US between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 0.29% of all fatal aviation aircraft accidents. All the pilots involved had been medically screened and none had demonstrated mental disorder, depression or suicidal thoughts. Some people are asking why there is no system for wresting control of a plane from a control tower. In fact, such a system does exist, reports the Daily Mail, but it is not being used. In 2006, Boeing was awarded a patent for an \"uninterrupted autopilot system\" with its own power supply that could be activated by those on board a plane or on the ground. However, safety concerns - including the possibility that such a system could be hacked - have prevented its roll-out. The crash also raises questions about the cockpit door mechanism which Lubitz used to keep the pilot out. The system, which allows a pilot to override the coded entry mechanism on the outside of the door, was designed in the event of a terrorist emergency. Airlines are going to have to balance those concerns against the possibility that individuals like Lubitz might decide to do harm, said the BBC's transport correspondent Richard Westcott. Lubitz was able to fly the plane into the ground without interruption since he seized the opportunity to lock the cockpit doors while the plane's pilot was going to the toilet. Some airlines enforce a \"rule of two\" - that there should never be fewer than two people left in the cockpit. For these airlines, a member of the cabin crew enters the cockpit when appropriate to ensure this rule is followed. After the Germanwings crash, several airlines, including Lufthansa, announced they were adopting this rule. The European Aviation Safety Agency has recommended that at least two people be present in the cockpit at all times. China's aviation authority has also introduced the rule and the UK's Civil Aviation Authority has contacted all UK airlines \"to require them to review all relevant procedures\". What relatives of plane crash victims need most are answers, experts say. But the more we learn about Lubitz, the more heartbreaking the Germanwings crash seems. Evidence from research suggests that trauma inflicted by other humans on purpose is more difficult to come to terms with than natural disasters, clinical psychologist Roderick Orner told the BBC. Acts of violence are also harder to process than accidents due to negligence or mechanical failure. \"Violence is often experienced as an attack on human integrity,\" says psychiatrist Lars Weiseth. \"This aspect causes increasing anger, loss of trust in companies and people, and sharply increases the risk to mental health.\" The fact that Lubitz seemingly had no agenda for his actions does not necessarily make things easier, since the deaths could seem meaningless. If he had been a terrorist, Prof Weiseth says, relatives might be able to see their family members as \"involuntary participants in an important struggle for democratic values\".

The statement is potentially damaging for the airline and its CEO Carsten Spohr, who told reporters last week that the carrier knew of no reason why 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz might deliberately crash a plane. The fact that Lufthansa officials were aware that Lubitz suffered from depression raises questions about its screening process for pilots as it faces the threat of legal action from relatives of the victims. Lufthansa said Lubitz broke off his pilot training for a period of several months but then passed medical checks confirming his fitness to fly. When Lubitz resumed training in 2009, he provided the flight school with medical documents showing that he had gone through a \u201cprevious episode of severe depression,\u201d Lufthansa said, citing emailed correspondence between Lubitz and the flight school. Duesseldorf state prosecutors said on Monday Lubitz had been treated for suicidal tendencies before getting his pilot\u2019s licence. They last week found torn-up sick notes showing that Lubitz was suffering from an illness that should have grounded him. Related Coverage See more stories Germanwings said it had not received a sick note from Lubitz for the day of the crash. Lubitz had a valid medical certificate at the time of the crash of the Airbus A320 operated by its budget unit, Lufthansa added. Lufthansa said it had passed the email correspondence and additional documents to the Duesseldorf prosecutors after internal investigations. Lufthansa was already facing unlimited liability for damages in the crash, lawyers have said, and has told its insurers to set aside $300 million to deal with claims, recovery costs and the loss of the aircraft. For Germanwings to limit its liability, it would have to establish that it and its employees and agents were not in any way at fault or that the accident had been caused solely by the fault of a third party. Lubitz\u2019s statement about severe depression raises more questions about what the flight school and Lufthansa did, or did not do, to make sure he was fit to fly, said New York lawyer Justin Green, who represents families in aviation disasters. \u201cBased on the facts as they are now known, I find it hard to accept that the airline did not have the opportunity to discover that he was a danger,\u201d Green wrote in an email. \u201cI do not expect the airline will try to have a liability fight under the circumstances.\u201d European pilots pass psychiatric screening ahead of starting training but annual medical checks do not include a specific in-depth psychiatric test. Pilots are expected to inform medical examiners at their annual checks of any health issues that could affect their flying ability. Psychiatrists and pilots have said there is no fail-safe test to spot suicidal pilots, but lawyers representing some of the families of victims of the Germanwings crash called on Tuesday for more regular psychiatric testing of pilots. French air accident investigators also said on Tuesday that their probe into the crash would look at psychological screening procedures for pilots and cockpit access, indicating the two areas where they are most likely to make safety recommendations that could affect the whole aviation industry. \u201cIn these cases, when you\u2019re acting for families, they\u2019re keen to see that lessons are learned, that pressure is put on airline authorities to improve flight safety,\u201d Jim Morris, a partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell, told Reuters.

Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin, in charge of the criminal inquiry into the crash, told CNN that \u201cso far no videos were used in the crash investigation.\u201d He added, \u201cA person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators.\u201d Robin\u2019s comments follow claims by two publications, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board the flight as it crashed into the French Alps on March 24. Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is accused of deliberately bringing down the plane, killing all 150 on board. Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site. The two publications described the supposed video but did not post it on their websites. They said that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. Germanwings plane crashes in France \u201cOne can hear cries of \u2018My God\u2019 in several languages,\u201d Paris Match reported. \u201cMetallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object. Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing.\u201d \u201cIt is a very disturbing scene,\u201d said Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online. An official with France\u2019s air accident investigation agency, the BEA, said the agency was not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the reports were \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d and \u201cunwarranted.\u201d Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but added that they \u201chadn\u2019t been exploited yet.\u201d Opinion: What if my patient is a pilot? Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny-sous-Bois, near Paris, to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand in hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far has been sent to the institute, Menichini said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media, Menichini answered with a categorical \u201cno.\u201d Reichelt told CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett: Outfront\u201d that he had watched the video and stood by the report, saying Bild and Paris Match are \u201cvery confident\u201d that the clip is real.

Lufthansa CEO visits crash site, avoids questions Speaking as he visited the crash site in the French Alps, he said, \u201cThere is not a single hour where we don\u2019t think about this terrible accident, the victims and the relatives and friends of these victims. \u201cWe are learning more every day about the cause of the accident, but I think it will take a long, long time for everybody, all of us, to understand how this could happen.\u201d Spohr also thanked all those involved in the investigation and recovery efforts as well as local residents for their response to the devastating crash. He added a wreath to the pile of flowers left by grieving families at a simple stone memorial set up in the village of Le Vernet, the closest accessible point to the crash site. A memorial service was also to take place Wednesday in the town of Haltern, Germany, which lost 16 students and two teachers in the crash. Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525.

Prosecutors: Co-pilot suicidal at one time Check out the latest from our correspondents Who was the captain of Germanwings Flight 9525? Meanwhile, French investigative newspaper Le Canard Enchaine reported Wednesday that the Gendarmerie Nationale, or National Police, had questioned Remy Jouty, the head of the BEA, regarding leaks in the investigation \u2013 specifically a report in The New York Times about the contents of the cockpit voice recorder. BEA spokeswoman Martine Del Bono confirmed to CNN that the Gendarmerie Nationale questioned Jouty regarding the Germanwings investigation but refused to elaborate. She said he was questioned on the evening of March 25. That same day, The New York Times reported that the Germanwings pilot was locked out of the cockpit just before the crash. \u201cAn investigator said evidence from a cockpit voice recorder indicated one pilot left the cockpit before the plane\u2019s descent and was unable to get back in,\u201d reporter Nicola Clark wrote. Wednesday\u2019s article in Le Canard Enchain\u00e9, citing a government source, said: \u201cThey (the Gendarmerie) reproached him (Jouty) for not informing the Prosecutor first regarding the content of the cockpit voice recorder. \u201cThe Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, in charge of the investigation and the Gendarmerie found out about the cockpit voice recorder content in \u2026 the press!\u201d said Le Canard Enchain\u00e9. Separately, the French National Union of Airline Pilots confirmed that it had filed a complaint against a person it identified merely as \u201cX\u201d last week for breach of confidentiality after \u201ca source close to the investigation\u201d leaked information to The New York Times. \u201cThe article states that the source is a high official part of the team of investigators and that he had access to audio recordings from the recorder,\u201d the union\u2019s statement said. The union said information taken from the recording was \u201ccommunicated to the press before it was given to the judicial inquiry and especially families.\u201d It claimed European rules had been violated by those who had access to the recordings.

He first took to the skies as a member of a gliding club in his hometown of Montabaur in west Germany before fulfilling his ambition of becoming a professional pilot. Friends and neighbours described him as a \"quiet\" but \"fun\" character, who enjoyed his job. A picture from his now defunct Facebook page shows him smiling happily in front of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In the aftermath of the disaster, investigators have established a very different side to his character. Police found torn-up sick notes in his homes, including one covering the day of the crash. Despite assertions from friends that he was in good spirits, the final report on the crash by French investigators found he had suffered from a psychiatric condition and had been taking medication before the crash. Fearing he was losing his vision, he had hidden the evidence from his employer. The Bild newspaper also reported that he may have been going through a \"personal life crisis\" at the time of the crash. Lsubitz lived at his parents' home in Montabaur, a town near Frankfurt of about 12,500 people. His father Guenther worked in banking and his mother was a church organist. He was about 14 when he joined the LSC Westerwald glider club in Montabaur, where he learned to fly in a sleek white ASK-21 two-seater and went on to obtain his full licence, according to club chairman Klaus Radke. He was also a keen runner, competing in several races. In 2007, he graduated from high school and was accepted as a Lufthansa trainee the following year, enrolling at the company's training school in Bremen. Lubitz had a break in training about six years ago, lasting several months, according to Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr. Mr Spohr refused to disclose the reason for this gap but said his suitability had been reassessed and Lubitz had resumed his studies. But the final report of the investigation into the crash finds the interruption was caused by medical problems. He suffered a serious depressive episode during his treatment and went on to receive treatment for a year and a half. During that time, he considered suicide but was eventually declared healthy. It was recommended by a doctor that he needed special regular medical inspection and his medical certificates were valid for only one year at a time. A relevant note was added to his aviation authority file as well as to his pilot's licence. In 2013 he joined Lufthansa's low budget airline, Germanwings. He initially worked as a flight attendant before starting his role as co-pilot. His duties would have included monitoring instruments, communicating with air traffic controllers and sharing control of the aircraft with the captain. He would have also been expected to steer the plane during the pilot's breaks, or if he or she became ill. Lufthansa said Lubitz had flown a total of 630 hours before the fatal crash. He underwent a regular security check on 27 January and nothing untoward was found. Previous security checks in 2008 and 2010 also showed no issues. \"He was 100% fit to fly without any restrictions or conditions,\" Mr Spohr said. Yet the crash investigation found differently. He had battled with vision problems and insomnia for several months, it said, caused by a psychiatric disorder rather than anything physical. He was taking medication for both psychiatric issues and insomnia, and had been given doctor's notes excusing him from work. But he never showed them to the airline. \"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode and was taking psychotropic medication,\" the report found. \"This made him unfit to fly.\" But the report found he had hidden the evidence, and neither the airline nor his colleagues could have known about his circumstances. Those who knew Lubitz have described him as an affable young man, who gave no indications he was harbouring any harmful intent. This video can not be played Members of the flight club where Andreas Lubitz was a member have been talking about his personality Klaus Radke told the Associated Press that he had seen him when he returned to the club to renew his glider licence in the autumn of 2014. \"He seemed very enthusiastic about his career,\" he said. \"I can't remember anything where something wasn't right.\" Peter Ruecker, a long-time member of club, also insisted Lubitz had seemed \"very happy\" during their last meeting. \"I'm just speechless,\" he said. \"I don't have any explanation for this. Knowing Andreas, this is just inconceivable for me.\" A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet.

The discovery of the bodies came about 24 hours after the blast brought down the four-storey building in the Mediterranean port city in southern France. Emergency workers had continued rescue operations through Sunday night into the early hours of Monday with the help of a crane and lights, but a persistent fire underneath the rubble hampered their work, making it difficult for firefighters to deploy sniffer dogs. \u201cGiven the particular difficulties of intervention, the extraction  will take time,\u201d the fire department said in a statement announcing the bodies had been found. \u201cThe judicial authority will then proceed to identify\u201d the victims, it added. Earlier on Sunday, before the discovery of the bodies, local prosecutor Dominique Laurens said eight people \u201cwere not responding to phone calls\u201d. Five people from neighbouring buildings sustained minor injuries in the blast and collapse, which occurred abot 1.40am on Sunday local time. \u201cTonight, the pain and sorrow are great,\u201d Marseille\u2019s mayor, Benoit Payan, said in a statement. \u201cAll services of the city, as well as the state, are still at this very moment fully committed to continue the search.\u201d The cause of the explosion is still to be determined, but investigators are looking at the possibility it was the result of a gas leak. More than 100 firefighters were battling the blaze in the ruins of the building, which was believed to have one apartment on each floor. \u201cWe have nothing, not even an ID card. We have lost everything,\u201d said a man who gave his name as Roland in an interview with local newspaper La Provence. He managed to get out of the building on 15 Rue de Tivoli with his wife and two children before it collapsed, together with a neighbouring building, after the explosion around 12.40am local time. A third building partly collapsed. Five people were taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. The interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, who visited the site, said 30 buildings in the area were evacuated. Saveria Mosnier, who lives in a street near the site in the La Plaine neighbourhood, said: \u201cI was sleeping and there was this huge blast that really shook the room. I was shocked awake as if I had been dreaming. \u201cWe very quickly smelled a strong gas odour that hung around. We could still smell it this morning.\u201d It was unclear how many people were inside the collapsed buildings. \u201cNot all the people who were supposedly inside \u2026 have been seen. Families are worried,\u201d the French housing minister, Olivier Klein, told the broadcaster Franceinfo. Christophe Mirmand, the prefect of the southern Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne region, said: \u201cWe have to be very cautious about what the cause was at this stage.\u201d Gas was \u201cone possible option\u201d. Gilles, who lives on a sidestreet near the building, told AFP the sound of the crash \u201cwas huge\u201d. \u201cIt sounded like an explosion,\u201d he said, declining to provide his last name. Almost 200 residents were evacuated and 50 requested to be urgently rehoused. An aid centre for people looking for missing family members or loved ones has been opened in a neighbouring district. Eight were killed in Marseille in 2018 when two dilapidated buildings in the working-class district of Noailles caved in. It cast a harsh light on the city\u2019s housing standards, with aid groups saying 40,000 people live in shoddy structures. But authorities appeared to rule out structural issues in the latest collapse, in a neighbourhood known for its bars and nightlife. \u201cThere was no danger notice for this building, and it is not in a neighbourhood identified as having substandard housing,\u201d said Mirmand. Further back in Marseille\u2019s history, eight people were killed in a building collapse in 1981, five in an explosion in 1985, and four in a 1996 gas blast that demolished a seven-storey building.

A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet. The final accident report by the French authorities answered many questions - but some are still a mystery. Investigators ruled out terrorism early on and their position did not change when it was revealed that they believed Lubitz had deliberately crashed the aircraft. That was upheld in the final report, which found that he had been suffering from psychiatric issues he had hidden from his colleagues. The co-pilot did not behave in a peculiar or extreme manner and people who knew him expressed shock over the event. \"He's not the type of guy who would try and kill other people - absolutely not,\" a neighbour said. \"He was really just a very normal, not very remarkable, nice young man,\" said Klaus Radke, the president of the club near Montabaur in Germany where Lubitz had learned to fly. Lubitz had battled depression before, suspending his training for medical reasons in 2008. The final crash investigation report detailed his medical history and showed he had started to suffer from a \"severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms\". During that period, he considered suicide and \"made several 'no suicide pacts' with his treating psychiatrist and was hospitalised\", the report says. In April 2009, his medical certificate was not revalidated \"due to depression and the taking of medication to treat it\". In July that year, he was declared \"entirely healthy\" and given a one-year medical certificate, with a note that it must be renewed each year. It was renewed annually without incident until December 2014. It was then that Lubitz consulted doctors about \"vision problems and sleep disorders\" but eye specialists could not find a physical cause. Instead, investigators say, he was diagnosed with a \"psychosomatic disorder\" - a physical illness caused by a mental factor. In February 2015, he was given a sick certificate for eight days, which he did not forward to the airline. Over the next month, he would be issued several more medical certificates, none of which his employer saw; was prescribed insomnia and antidepressant medication; and was referred \"for psychiatric hospital treatment due to a possible psychosis\". Traces of the medications were found in his remains during a post-mortem toxicology exam. \"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode, and was taking psychotropic medication,\" the report found. \"This made him unfit to fly.\" Prosecutors in Duesseldorf at the time of the crash found torn-up sick notes, including for the day of the crash. In April 2015, German prosecutors said Lubitz had researched \"ways to commit suicide\" on his tablet at home in the week before the crash. Another of his internet searches was for \"cockpit doors and their security provisions\". The German tabloid paper Bild said (in German) it had seen documents that said he was suffering from a \"personal life crisis\", having recently broken up with a girlfriend. But even when we have a fuller picture of Lubitz's state of mind before the crash, some of his actions may remain a mystery forever. For example, after he had decided to kill himself and everyone else on board the plane, why did he set the aircraft on a controlled, rather than a sudden, descent? Depression is a serious illness, and it affects everyone differently. People experiencing depression can reach such a state of alienation that they risk taking their lives - but the vast majority of people with depression would never harm anyone other than themselves. Writing in the Times, Jennifer Wild, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, has said that the irrational thinking evident from Lubitz's actions in the cockpit may have been triggered by depression, possibly caused by a recent traumatic episode. \"Perhaps in his state he did not consider the consequences of his actions, or perhaps he did not care because he was consumed with ending his life,\" she wrote, adding that drug-taking or a bout of extreme anger might also explain his actions. The black box recording of Lubitz's calm breathing as he pressed the controls to send the aeroplane hurtling to the ground may lead some to believe he was a psychopath but Dr Wild notes that psychopaths generally avoid harming themselves. Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that millions of people in Britain suffered from depression, which is a treatable illness. He told the BBC that this included pilots who \"resume flying, perfectly safely, for maybe tens of years afterwards\". The fact that Lubitz appears to have been signed off as sick raises the question of whether there was - or should have been - contact between his doctors and the airline. Medical practitioners take an oath to maintain patient confidentiality but some US states have expanded doctors' duty of care to the community at large. This allows them to warn third\n\nquestion: What did journalists at Bild and Paris Match believe about the video clip?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1135}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In Germany, trainee pilots are subjected to medical examinations which include oral psychological assessments. There is some debate as to whether such assessments are thorough enough. One question an examiner might ask a pilot is, \"Do you have a butterfly collection at home?\", the Suddeitsche Zeitung reported (in German). At the time of the crash, Lufthansa said that after they hired pilots they did not subject them to regular psychological examinations. This is obligatory in other countries, such as the US and UK. Airline staff are encouraged to report strange behaviour on the part of their colleagues but a former pilot told the BBC that peer pressure could act as a brake on this process. And Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa's chief, admitted: \"All the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case.\" But Mr Spohr also said: \"No matter your safety regulations, no matter how high you set the bar, and we have incredibly high standards, there is no way to rule out such an event. This is an awful one-off event.\" Aircraft-assisted pilot suicides are rare. A 2014 study by the Federal Aviation Authority identified eight such instances in the US between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 0.29% of all fatal aviation aircraft accidents. All the pilots involved had been medically screened and none had demonstrated mental disorder, depression or suicidal thoughts. Some people are asking why there is no system for wresting control of a plane from a control tower. In fact, such a system does exist, reports the Daily Mail, but it is not being used. In 2006, Boeing was awarded a patent for an \"uninterrupted autopilot system\" with its own power supply that could be activated by those on board a plane or on the ground. However, safety concerns - including the possibility that such a system could be hacked - have prevented its roll-out. The crash also raises questions about the cockpit door mechanism which Lubitz used to keep the pilot out. The system, which allows a pilot to override the coded entry mechanism on the outside of the door, was designed in the event of a terrorist emergency. Airlines are going to have to balance those concerns against the possibility that individuals like Lubitz might decide to do harm, said the BBC's transport correspondent Richard Westcott. Lubitz was able to fly the plane into the ground without interruption since he seized the opportunity to lock the cockpit doors while the plane's pilot was going to the toilet. Some airlines enforce a \"rule of two\" - that there should never be fewer than two people left in the cockpit. For these airlines, a member of the cabin crew enters the cockpit when appropriate to ensure this rule is followed. After the Germanwings crash, several airlines, including Lufthansa, announced they were adopting this rule. The European Aviation Safety Agency has recommended that at least two people be present in the cockpit at all times. China's aviation authority has also introduced the rule and the UK's Civil Aviation Authority has contacted all UK airlines \"to require them to review all relevant procedures\". What relatives of plane crash victims need most are answers, experts say. But the more we learn about Lubitz, the more heartbreaking the Germanwings crash seems. Evidence from research suggests that trauma inflicted by other humans on purpose is more difficult to come to terms with than natural disasters, clinical psychologist Roderick Orner told the BBC. Acts of violence are also harder to process than accidents due to negligence or mechanical failure. \"Violence is often experienced as an attack on human integrity,\" says psychiatrist Lars Weiseth. \"This aspect causes increasing anger, loss of trust in companies and people, and sharply increases the risk to mental health.\" The fact that Lubitz seemingly had no agenda for his actions does not necessarily make things easier, since the deaths could seem meaningless. If he had been a terrorist, Prof Weiseth says, relatives might be able to see their family members as \"involuntary participants in an important struggle for democratic values\".

The statement is potentially damaging for the airline and its CEO Carsten Spohr, who told reporters last week that the carrier knew of no reason why 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz might deliberately crash a plane. The fact that Lufthansa officials were aware that Lubitz suffered from depression raises questions about its screening process for pilots as it faces the threat of legal action from relatives of the victims. Lufthansa said Lubitz broke off his pilot training for a period of several months but then passed medical checks confirming his fitness to fly. When Lubitz resumed training in 2009, he provided the flight school with medical documents showing that he had gone through a \u201cprevious episode of severe depression,\u201d Lufthansa said, citing emailed correspondence between Lubitz and the flight school. Duesseldorf state prosecutors said on Monday Lubitz had been treated for suicidal tendencies before getting his pilot\u2019s licence. They last week found torn-up sick notes showing that Lubitz was suffering from an illness that should have grounded him. Related Coverage See more stories Germanwings said it had not received a sick note from Lubitz for the day of the crash. Lubitz had a valid medical certificate at the time of the crash of the Airbus A320 operated by its budget unit, Lufthansa added. Lufthansa said it had passed the email correspondence and additional documents to the Duesseldorf prosecutors after internal investigations. Lufthansa was already facing unlimited liability for damages in the crash, lawyers have said, and has told its insurers to set aside $300 million to deal with claims, recovery costs and the loss of the aircraft. For Germanwings to limit its liability, it would have to establish that it and its employees and agents were not in any way at fault or that the accident had been caused solely by the fault of a third party. Lubitz\u2019s statement about severe depression raises more questions about what the flight school and Lufthansa did, or did not do, to make sure he was fit to fly, said New York lawyer Justin Green, who represents families in aviation disasters. \u201cBased on the facts as they are now known, I find it hard to accept that the airline did not have the opportunity to discover that he was a danger,\u201d Green wrote in an email. \u201cI do not expect the airline will try to have a liability fight under the circumstances.\u201d European pilots pass psychiatric screening ahead of starting training but annual medical checks do not include a specific in-depth psychiatric test. Pilots are expected to inform medical examiners at their annual checks of any health issues that could affect their flying ability. Psychiatrists and pilots have said there is no fail-safe test to spot suicidal pilots, but lawyers representing some of the families of victims of the Germanwings crash called on Tuesday for more regular psychiatric testing of pilots. French air accident investigators also said on Tuesday that their probe into the crash would look at psychological screening procedures for pilots and cockpit access, indicating the two areas where they are most likely to make safety recommendations that could affect the whole aviation industry. \u201cIn these cases, when you\u2019re acting for families, they\u2019re keen to see that lessons are learned, that pressure is put on airline authorities to improve flight safety,\u201d Jim Morris, a partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell, told Reuters.

Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin, in charge of the criminal inquiry into the crash, told CNN that \u201cso far no videos were used in the crash investigation.\u201d He added, \u201cA person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators.\u201d Robin\u2019s comments follow claims by two publications, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board the flight as it crashed into the French Alps on March 24. Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is accused of deliberately bringing down the plane, killing all 150 on board. Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site. The two publications described the supposed video but did not post it on their websites. They said that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. Germanwings plane crashes in France \u201cOne can hear cries of \u2018My God\u2019 in several languages,\u201d Paris Match reported. \u201cMetallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object.

An official with France\u2019s air accident investigation agency, the BEA, said the agency was not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the reports were \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d and \u201cunwarranted.\u201d Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but added that they \u201chadn\u2019t been exploited yet.\u201d Opinion: What if my patient is a pilot? Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny-sous-Bois, near Paris, to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand in hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far has been sent to the institute, Menichini said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media, Menichini answered with a categorical \u201cno.\u201d Reichelt told CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett: Outfront\u201d that he had watched the video and stood by the report, saying Bild and Paris Match are \u201cvery confident\u201d that the clip is real. He noted that investigators only revealed they\u2019d recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports. \u201cThat is something we did not know before. \u2026 Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren\u2019t revealed by the investigation at the beginning,\u201d he said. What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot? Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr expressed his \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d Wednesday over the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 and promised to help the victims\u2019 families for as long as they need. Lufthansa CEO visits crash site, avoids questions Speaking as he visited the crash site in the French Alps, he said, \u201cThere is not a single hour where we don\u2019t think about this terrible accident, the victims and the relatives and friends of these victims. \u201cWe are learning more every day about the cause of the accident, but I think it will take a long, long time for everybody, all of us, to understand how this could happen.\u201d Spohr also thanked all those involved in the investigation and recovery efforts as well as local residents for their response to the devastating crash. He added a wreath to the pile of flowers left by grieving families at a simple stone memorial set up in the village of Le Vernet, the closest accessible point to the crash site. A memorial service was also to take place Wednesday in the town of Haltern, Germany, which lost 16 students and two teachers in the crash. Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525.

Prosecutors: Co-pilot suicidal at one time Check out the latest from our correspondents Who was the captain of Germanwings Flight 9525? Meanwhile, French investigative newspaper Le Canard Enchaine reported Wednesday that the Gendarmerie Nationale, or National Police, had questioned Remy Jouty, the head of the BEA, regarding leaks in the investigation \u2013 specifically a report in The New York Times about the contents of the cockpit voice recorder. BEA spokeswoman Martine Del Bono confirmed to CNN that the Gendarmerie Nationale questioned Jouty regarding the Germanwings investigation but refused to elaborate. She said he was questioned on the evening of March 25. That same day, The New York Times reported that the Germanwings pilot was locked out of the cockpit just before the crash. \u201cAn investigator said evidence from a cockpit voice recorder indicated one pilot left the cockpit before the plane\u2019s descent and was unable to get back in,\u201d reporter Nicola Clark wrote. Wednesday\u2019s article in Le Canard Enchain\u00e9, citing a government source, said: \u201cThey (the Gendarmerie) reproached him (Jouty) for not informing the Prosecutor first regarding the content of the cockpit voice recorder. \u201cThe Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, in charge of the investigation and the Gendarmerie found out about the cockpit voice recorder content in \u2026 the press!\u201d said Le Canard Enchain\u00e9. Separately, the French National Union of Airline Pilots confirmed that it had filed a complaint against a person it identified merely as \u201cX\u201d last week for breach of confidentiality after \u201ca source close to the investigation\u201d leaked information to The New York Times. \u201cThe article states that the source is a high official part of the team of investigators and that he had access to audio recordings from the recorder,\u201d the union\u2019s statement said. The union said information taken from the recording was \u201ccommunicated to the press before it was given to the judicial inquiry and especially families.\u201d It claimed European rules had been violated by those who had access to the recordings.

He first took to the skies as a member of a gliding club in his hometown of Montabaur in west Germany before fulfilling his ambition of becoming a professional pilot. Friends and neighbours described him as a \"quiet\" but \"fun\" character, who enjoyed his job. A picture from his now defunct Facebook page shows him smiling happily in front of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In the aftermath of the disaster, investigators have established a very different side to his character. Police found torn-up sick notes in his homes, including one covering the day of the crash. Despite assertions from friends that he was in good spirits, the final report on the crash by French investigators found he had suffered from a psychiatric condition and had been taking medication before the crash. Fearing he was losing his vision, he had hidden the evidence from his employer. The Bild newspaper also reported that he may have been going through a \"personal life crisis\" at the time of the crash. Lsubitz lived at his parents' home in Montabaur, a town near Frankfurt of about 12,500 people. His father Guenther worked in banking and his mother was a church organist. He was about 14 when he joined the LSC Westerwald glider club in Montabaur, where he learned to fly in a sleek white ASK-21 two-seater and went on to obtain his full licence, according to club chairman Klaus Radke. He was also a keen runner, competing in several races. In 2007, he graduated from high school and was accepted as a Lufthansa trainee the following year, enrolling at the company's training school in Bremen. Lubitz had a break in training about six years ago, lasting several months, according to Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr. Mr Spohr refused to disclose the reason for this gap but said his suitability had been reassessed and Lubitz had resumed his studies. But the final report of the investigation into the crash finds the interruption was caused by medical problems. He suffered a serious depressive episode during his treatment and went on to receive treatment for a year and a half. During that time, he considered suicide but was eventually declared healthy. It was recommended by a doctor that he needed special regular medical inspection and his medical certificates were valid for only one year at a time. A relevant note was added to his aviation authority file as well as to his pilot's licence. In 2013 he joined Lufthansa's low budget airline, Germanwings. He initially worked as a flight attendant before starting his role as co-pilot. His duties would have included monitoring instruments, communicating with air traffic controllers and sharing control of the aircraft with the captain. He would have also been expected to steer the plane during the pilot's breaks, or if he or she became ill. Lufthansa said Lubitz had flown a total of 630 hours before the fatal crash. He underwent a regular security check on 27 January and nothing untoward was found. Previous security checks in 2008 and 2010 also showed no issues. \"He was 100% fit to fly without any restrictions or conditions,\" Mr Spohr said. Yet the crash investigation found differently. He had battled with vision problems and insomnia for several months, it said, caused by a psychiatric disorder rather than anything physical. He was taking medication for both psychiatric issues and insomnia, and had been given doctor's notes excusing him from work. But he never showed them to the airline. \"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode and was taking psychotropic medication,\" the report found. \"This made him unfit to fly.\" But the report found he had hidden the evidence, and neither the airline nor his colleagues could have known about his circumstances. Those who knew Lubitz have described him as an affable young man, who gave no indications he was harbouring any harmful intent. This video can not be played Members of the flight club where Andreas Lubitz was a member have been talking about his personality Klaus Radke told the Associated Press that he had seen him when he returned to the club to renew his glider licence in the autumn of 2014. \"He seemed very enthusiastic about his career,\" he said. \"I can't remember anything where something wasn't right.\" Peter Ruecker, a long-time member of club, also insisted Lubitz had seemed \"very happy\" during their last meeting. \"I'm just speechless,\" he said. \"I don't have any explanation for this. Knowing Andreas, this is just inconceivable for me.\" A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet.

The discovery of the bodies came about 24 hours after the blast brought down the four-storey building in the Mediterranean port city in southern France. Emergency workers had continued rescue operations through Sunday night into the early hours of Monday with the help of a crane and lights, but a persistent fire underneath the rubble hampered their work, making it difficult for firefighters to deploy sniffer dogs. \u201cGiven the particular difficulties of intervention, the extraction  will take time,\u201d the fire department said in a statement announcing the bodies had been found. \u201cThe judicial authority will then proceed to identify\u201d the victims, it added. Earlier on Sunday, before the discovery of the bodies, local prosecutor Dominique Laurens said eight people \u201cwere not responding to phone calls\u201d. Five people from neighbouring buildings sustained minor injuries in the blast and collapse, which occurred abot 1.40am on Sunday local time. \u201cTonight, the pain and sorrow are great,\u201d Marseille\u2019s mayor, Benoit Payan, said in a statement. \u201cAll services of the city, as well as the state, are still at this very moment fully committed to continue the search.\u201d The cause of the explosion is still to be determined, but investigators are looking at the possibility it was the result of a gas leak. More than 100 firefighters were battling the blaze in the ruins of the building, which was believed to have one apartment on each floor. \u201cWe have nothing, not even an ID card. We have lost everything,\u201d said a man who gave his name as Roland in an interview with local newspaper La Provence. He managed to get out of the building on 15 Rue de Tivoli with his wife and two children before it collapsed, together with a neighbouring building, after the explosion around 12.40am local time. A third building partly collapsed. Five people were taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. The interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, who visited the site, said 30 buildings in the area were evacuated. Saveria Mosnier, who lives in a street near the site in the La Plaine neighbourhood, said: \u201cI was sleeping and there was this huge blast that really shook the room. I was shocked awake as if I had been dreaming. \u201cWe very quickly smelled a strong gas odour that hung around. We could still smell it this morning.\u201d It was unclear how many people were inside the collapsed buildings. \u201cNot all the people who were supposedly inside \u2026 have been seen. Families are worried,\u201d the French housing minister, Olivier Klein, told the broadcaster Franceinfo. Christophe Mirmand, the prefect of the southern Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne region, said: \u201cWe have to be very cautious about what the cause was at this stage.\u201d Gas was \u201cone possible option\u201d. Gilles, who lives on a sidestreet near the building, told AFP the sound of the crash \u201cwas huge\u201d. \u201cIt sounded like an explosion,\u201d he said, declining to provide his last name. Almost 200 residents were evacuated and 50 requested to be urgently rehoused. An aid centre for people looking for missing family members or loved ones has been opened in a neighbouring district. Eight were killed in Marseille in 2018 when two dilapidated buildings in the working-class district of Noailles caved in. It cast a harsh light on the city\u2019s housing standards, with aid groups saying 40,000 people live in shoddy structures. But authorities appeared to rule out structural issues in the latest collapse, in a neighbourhood known for its bars and nightlife. \u201cThere was no danger notice for this building, and it is not in a neighbourhood identified as having substandard housing,\u201d said Mirmand. Further back in Marseille\u2019s history, eight people were killed in a building collapse in 1981, five in an explosion in 1985, and four in a 1996 gas blast that demolished a seven-storey building.

A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet. The final accident report by the French authorities answered many questions - but some are still a mystery. Investigators ruled out terrorism early on and their position did not change when it was revealed that they believed Lubitz had deliberately crashed the aircraft. That was upheld in the final report, which found that he had been suffering from psychiatric issues he had hidden from his colleagues. The co-pilot did not behave in a peculiar or extreme manner and people who knew him expressed shock over the event. \"He's not the type of guy who would try and kill other people - absolutely not,\" a neighbour said. \"He was really just a very normal, not very remarkable, nice young man,\" said Klaus Radke, the president of the club near Montabaur in Germany where Lubitz had learned to fly. Lubitz had battled depression before, suspending his training for medical reasons in 2008. The final crash investigation report detailed his medical history and showed he had started to suffer from a \"severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms\". During that period, he considered suicide and \"made several 'no suicide pacts' with his treating psychiatrist and was hospitalised\", the report says. In April 2009, his medical certificate was not revalidated \"due to depression and the taking of medication to treat it\". In July that year, he was declared \"entirely healthy\" and given a one-year medical certificate, with a note that it must be renewed each year. It was renewed annually without incident until December 2014. It was then that Lubitz consulted doctors about \"vision problems and sleep disorders\" but eye specialists could not find a physical cause. Instead, investigators say, he was diagnosed with a \"psychosomatic disorder\" - a physical illness caused by a mental factor. In February 2015, he was given a sick certificate for eight days, which he did not forward to the airline. Over the next month, he would be issued several more medical certificates, none of which his employer saw; was prescribed insomnia and antidepressant medication; and was referred \"for psychiatric hospital treatment due to a possible psychosis\". Traces of the medications were found in his remains during a post-mortem toxicology exam. \"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode, and was taking psychotropic medication,\" the report found. \"This made him unfit to fly.\" Prosecutors in Duesseldorf at the time of the crash found torn-up sick notes, including for the day of the crash. In April 2015, German prosecutors said Lubitz had researched \"ways to commit suicide\" on his tablet at home in the week before the crash. Another of his internet searches was for \"cockpit doors and their security provisions\". The German tabloid paper Bild said (in German) it had seen documents that said he was suffering from a \"personal life crisis\", having recently broken up with a girlfriend. But even when we have a fuller picture of Lubitz's state of mind before the crash, some of his actions may remain a mystery forever. For example, after he had decided to kill himself and everyone else on board the plane, why did he set the aircraft on a controlled, rather than a sudden, descent? Depression is a serious illness, and it affects everyone differently. People experiencing depression can reach such a state of alienation that they risk taking their lives - but the vast majority of people with depression would never harm anyone other than themselves. Writing in the Times, Jennifer Wild, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, has said that the irrational thinking evident from Lubitz's actions in the cockpit may have been triggered by depression, possibly caused by a recent traumatic episode. \"Perhaps in his state he did not consider the consequences of his actions, or perhaps he did not care because he was consumed with ending his life,\" she wrote, adding that drug-taking or a bout of extreme anger might also explain his actions. The black box recording of Lubitz's calm breathing as he pressed the controls to send the aeroplane hurtling to the ground may lead some to believe he was a psychopath but Dr Wild notes that psychopaths generally avoid harming themselves. Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that millions of people in Britain suffered from depression, which is a treatable illness. He told the BBC that this included pilots who \"resume flying, perfectly safely, for maybe tens of years afterwards\". The fact that Lubitz appears to have been signed off as sick raises the question of whether there was - or should have been - contact between his doctors and the airline. Medical practitioners take an oath to maintain patient confidentiality but some US states have expanded doctors' duty of care to the community at large.

In Germany, trainee pilots are subjected to medical examinations which include oral psychological assessments. There is some debate as to whether such assessments are thorough enough. One question an examiner might ask a pilot is, \"Do you have a butterfly collection at home?\", the Suddeitsche Zeitung reported (in German). At the time of the crash, Lufthansa said that after they hired pilots they did not subject them to regular psychological examinations. This is obligatory in other countries, such as the US and UK. Airline staff are encouraged to report strange behaviour on the part of their colleagues but a former pilot told the BBC that peer pressure could act as a brake on this process. And Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa's chief, admitted: \"All the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case.\" But Mr Spohr also said: \"No matter your safety regulations, no matter how high you set the bar, and we have incredibly high standards, there is no way to rule out such an event. This is an awful one-off event.\" Aircraft-assisted pilot suicides are rare. A 2014 study by the Federal Aviation Authority identified eight such instances in the US between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 0.29% of all fatal aviation aircraft accidents. All the pilots involved had been medically screened and none had demonstrated mental disorder, depression or suicidal thoughts. Some people are asking why there is no system for wresting control of a plane from a control tower. In fact, such a system does exist, reports the Daily Mail, but it is not being used. In 2006, Boeing was awarded a patent for an \"uninterrupted autopilot system\" with its own power supply that could be activated by those on board a plane or on the ground. However, safety concerns - including the possibility that such a system could be hacked - have prevented its roll-out. The crash also raises questions about the cockpit door mechanism which Lubitz used to keep the pilot out. The system, which allows a pilot to override the coded entry mechanism on the outside of the door, was designed in the event of a terrorist emergency. Airlines are going to have to balance those concerns against the possibility that individuals like Lubitz might decide to do harm, said the BBC's transport correspondent Richard Westcott. Lubitz was able to fly the plane into the ground without interruption since he seized the opportunity to lock the cockpit doors while the plane's pilot was going to the toilet. Some airlines enforce a \"rule of two\" - that there should never be fewer than two people left in the cockpit. For these airlines, a member of the cabin crew enters the cockpit when appropriate to ensure this rule is followed. After the Germanwings crash, several airlines, including Lufthansa, announced they were adopting this rule. The European Aviation Safety Agency has recommended that at least two people be present in the cockpit at all times. China's aviation authority has also introduced the rule and the UK's Civil Aviation Authority has contacted all UK airlines \"to require them to review all relevant procedures\". What relatives of plane crash victims need most are answers, experts say. But the more we learn about Lubitz, the more heartbreaking the Germanwings crash seems. Evidence from research suggests that trauma inflicted by other humans on purpose is more difficult to come to terms with than natural disasters, clinical psychologist Roderick Orner told the BBC. Acts of violence are also harder to process than accidents due to negligence or mechanical failure. \"Violence is often experienced as an attack on human integrity,\" says psychiatrist Lars Weiseth. \"This aspect causes increasing anger, loss of trust in companies and people, and sharply increases the risk to mental health.\" The fact that Lubitz seemingly had no agenda for his actions does not necessarily make things easier, since the deaths could seem meaningless. If he had been a terrorist, Prof Weiseth says, relatives might be able to see their family members as \"involuntary participants in an important struggle for democratic values\".

The statement is potentially damaging for the airline and its CEO Carsten Spohr, who told reporters last week that the carrier knew of no reason why 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz might deliberately crash a plane. The fact that Lufthansa officials were aware that Lubitz suffered from depression raises questions about its screening process for pilots as it faces the threat of legal action from relatives of the victims. Lufthansa said Lubitz broke off his pilot training for a period of several months but then passed medical checks confirming his fitness to fly. When Lubitz resumed training in 2009, he provided the flight school with medical documents showing that he had gone through a \u201cprevious episode of severe depression,\u201d Lufthansa said, citing emailed correspondence between Lubitz and the flight school. Duesseldorf state prosecutors said on Monday Lubitz had been treated for suicidal tendencies before getting his pilot\u2019s licence. They last week found torn-up sick notes showing that Lubitz was suffering from an illness that should have grounded him. Related Coverage See more stories Germanwings said it had not received a sick note from Lubitz for the day of the crash. Lubitz had a valid medical certificate at the time of the crash of the Airbus A320 operated by its budget unit, Lufthansa added. Lufthansa said it had passed the email correspondence and additional documents to the Duesseldorf prosecutors after internal investigations. Lufthansa was already facing unlimited liability for damages in the crash, lawyers have said, and has told its insurers to set aside $300 million to deal with claims, recovery costs and the loss of the aircraft. For Germanwings to limit its liability, it would have to establish that it and its employees and agents were not in any way at fault or that the accident had been caused solely by the fault of a third party. Lubitz\u2019s statement about severe depression raises more questions about what the flight school and Lufthansa did, or did not do, to make sure he was fit to fly, said New York lawyer Justin Green, who represents families in aviation disasters. \u201cBased on the facts as they are now known, I find it hard to accept that the airline did not have the opportunity to discover that he was a danger,\u201d Green wrote in an email. \u201cI do not expect the airline will try to have a liability fight under the circumstances.\u201d European pilots pass psychiatric screening ahead of starting training but annual medical checks do not include a specific in-depth psychiatric test. Pilots are expected to inform medical examiners at their annual checks of any health issues that could affect their flying ability. Psychiatrists and pilots have said there is no fail-safe test to spot suicidal pilots, but lawyers representing some of the families of victims of the Germanwings crash called on Tuesday for more regular psychiatric testing of pilots. French air accident investigators also said on Tuesday that their probe into the crash would look at psychological screening procedures for pilots and cockpit access, indicating the two areas where they are most likely to make safety recommendations that could affect the whole aviation industry. \u201cIn these cases, when you\u2019re acting for families, they\u2019re keen to see that lessons are learned, that pressure is put on airline authorities to improve flight safety,\u201d Jim Morris, a partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell, told Reuters.

Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin, in charge of the criminal inquiry into the crash, told CNN that \u201cso far no videos were used in the crash investigation.\u201d He added, \u201cA person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators.\u201d Robin\u2019s comments follow claims by two publications, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board the flight as it crashed into the French Alps on March 24. Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is accused of deliberately bringing down the plane, killing all 150 on board. Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site. The two publications described the supposed video but did not post it on their websites. They said that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. Germanwings plane crashes in France \u201cOne can hear cries of \u2018My God\u2019 in several languages,\u201d Paris Match reported. \u201cMetallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object. Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing.\u201d \u201cIt is a very disturbing scene,\u201d said Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online. An official with France\u2019s air accident investigation agency, the BEA, said the agency was not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the reports were \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d and \u201cunwarranted.\u201d Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but added that they \u201chadn\u2019t been exploited yet.\u201d Opinion: What if my patient is a pilot? Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny-sous-Bois, near Paris, to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand in hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far has been sent to the institute, Menichini said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media, Menichini answered with a categorical \u201cno.\u201d Reichelt told CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett: Outfront\u201d that he had watched the video and stood by the report, saying Bild and Paris Match are \u201cvery confident\u201d that the clip is real. He noted that investigators only revealed they\u2019d recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports. \u201cThat is something we did not know before. \u2026 Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren\u2019t revealed by the investigation at the beginning,\u201d he said. What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot? Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr expressed his \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d Wednesday over the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 and promised to help the victims\u2019 families for as long as they need. Lufthansa CEO visits crash site, avoids questions Speaking as he visited the crash site in the French Alps, he said, \u201cThere is not a single hour where we don\u2019t think about this terrible accident, the victims and the relatives and friends of these victims. \u201cWe are learning more every day about the cause of the accident, but I think it will take a long, long time for everybody, all of us, to understand how this could happen.\u201d Spohr also thanked all those involved in the investigation and recovery efforts as well as local residents for their response to the devastating crash. He added a wreath to the pile of flowers left by grieving families at a simple stone memorial set up in the village of Le Vernet, the closest accessible point to the crash site. A memorial service was also to take place Wednesday in the town of Haltern, Germany, which lost 16 students and two teachers in the crash. Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525. Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a \u201cprevious episode of severe depression,\u201d the German airline said Tuesday.\n\nquestion: When did Lubitz inform Lufthansa about his previous episode of severe depression?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "2009", "usage": 1066}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The announcement indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz\u2019s battle with depression, allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit. Germanwings crash compensation: What we know Lufthansa, whose CEO Spohr had previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a \u201cswift and seamless clarification\u201d and said it was sharing the information and documents \u2013 including training and medical records \u2013 with public prosecutors. Recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside. Menichini told CNN late Tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching. French President Francois Hollande, speaking Tuesday, said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week, sooner than authorities had previously suggested. In the meantime, the recovery of the victims\u2019 personal belongings will start Wednesday, Menichini said. Prosecutors: Co-pilot suicidal at one time Check out the latest from our correspondents Who was the captain of Germanwings Flight 9525? Meanwhile, French investigative newspaper Le Canard Enchaine reported Wednesday that the Gendarmerie Nationale, or National Police, had questioned Remy Jouty, the head of the BEA, regarding leaks in the investigation \u2013 specifically a report in The New York Times about the contents of the cockpit voice recorder. BEA spokeswoman Martine Del Bono confirmed to CNN that the Gendarmerie Nationale questioned Jouty regarding the Germanwings investigation but refused to elaborate. She said he was questioned on the evening of March 25. That same day, The New York Times reported that the Germanwings pilot was locked out of the cockpit just before the crash. \u201cAn investigator said evidence from a cockpit voice recorder indicated one pilot left the cockpit before the plane\u2019s descent and was unable to get back in,\u201d reporter Nicola Clark wrote. Wednesday\u2019s article in Le Canard Enchain\u00e9, citing a government source, said: \u201cThey (the Gendarmerie) reproached him (Jouty) for not informing the Prosecutor first regarding the content of the cockpit voice recorder. \u201cThe Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, in charge of the investigation and the Gendarmerie found out about the cockpit voice recorder content in \u2026 the press!\u201d said Le Canard Enchain\u00e9. Separately, the French National Union of Airline Pilots confirmed that it had filed a complaint against a person it identified merely as \u201cX\u201d last week for breach of confidentiality after \u201ca source close to the investigation\u201d leaked information to The New York Times. \u201cThe article states that the source is a high official part of the team of investigators and that he had access to audio recordings from the recorder,\u201d the union\u2019s statement said. The union said information taken from the recording was \u201ccommunicated to the press before it was given to the judicial inquiry and especially families.\u201d It claimed European rules had been violated by those who had access to the recordings.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Investigation into Germanwings Flight 9525 Crash and Co-Pilot's History of Depression\n\nevidence: Andreas Lubitz, the young co-pilot who deliberately crashed a Germanwings airliner into the French Alps on 24 March 2015, killing himself and 149 other people, started flying as a teenager. He first took to the skies as a member of a gliding club in his hometown of Montabaur in west Germany before fulfilling his ambition of becoming a professional pilot. Friends and neighbours described him as a \"quiet\" but \"fun\" character, who enjoyed his job. A picture from his now defunct Facebook page shows him smiling happily in front of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In the aftermath of the disaster, investigators have established a very different side to his character. Police found torn-up sick notes in his homes, including one covering the day of the crash. Despite assertions from friends that he was in good spirits, the final report on the crash by French investigators found he had suffered from a psychiatric condition and had been taking medication before the crash. Fearing he was losing his vision, he had hidden the evidence from his employer. The Bild newspaper also reported that he may have been going through a \"personal life crisis\" at the time of the crash. Lsubitz lived at his parents' home in Montabaur, a town near Frankfurt of about 12,500 people. His father Guenther worked in banking and his mother was a church organist. He was about 14 when he joined the LSC Westerwald glider club in Montabaur, where he learned to fly in a sleek white ASK-21 two-seater and went on to obtain his full licence, according to club chairman Klaus Radke. He was also a keen runner, competing in several races. In 2007, he graduated from high school and was accepted as a Lufthansa trainee the following year, enrolling at the company's training school in Bremen. Lubitz had a break in training about six years ago, lasting several months, according to Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr. Mr Spohr refused to disclose the reason for this gap but said his suitability had been reassessed and Lubitz had resumed his studies. But the final report of the investigation into the crash finds the interruption was caused by medical problems. He suffered a serious depressive episode during his treatment and went on to receive treatment for a year and a half. During that time, he considered suicide but was eventually declared healthy. It was recommended by a doctor that he needed special regular medical inspection and his medical certificates were valid for only one year at a time. A relevant note was added to his aviation authority file as well as to his pilot's licence. In 2013 he joined Lufthansa's low budget airline, Germanwings. He initially worked as a flight attendant before starting his role as co-pilot. His duties would have included monitoring instruments, communicating with air traffic controllers and sharing control of the aircraft with the captain. He would have also been expected to steer the plane during the pilot's breaks, or if he or she became ill. Lufthansa said Lubitz had flown a total of 630 hours before the fatal crash. He underwent a regular security check on 27 January and nothing untoward was found. Previous security checks in 2008 and 2010 also showed no issues. \"He was 100% fit to fly without any restrictions or conditions,\" Mr Spohr said. Yet the crash investigation found differently. He had battled with vision problems and insomnia for several months, it said, caused by a psychiatric disorder rather than anything physical. He was taking medication for both psychiatric issues and insomnia, and had been given doctor's notes excusing him from work. But he never showed them to the airline. \"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode and was taking psychotropic medication,\" the report found. \"This made him unfit to fly.\" But the report found he had hidden the evidence, and neither the airline nor his colleagues could have known about his circumstances. Those who knew Lubitz have described him as an affable young man, who gave no indications he was harbouring any harmful intent. This video can not be played Members of the flight club where Andreas Lubitz was a member have been talking about his personality Klaus Radke told the Associated Press that he had seen him when he returned to the club to renew his glider licence in the autumn of 2014. \"He seemed very enthusiastic about his career,\" he said. \"I can't remember anything where something wasn't right.\" Peter Ruecker, a long-time member of club, also insisted Lubitz had seemed \"very happy\" during their last meeting. \"I'm just speechless,\" he said. \"I don't have any explanation for this. Knowing Andreas, this is just inconceivable for me.\" A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet.

The discovery of the bodies came about 24 hours after the blast brought down the four-storey building in the Mediterranean port city in southern France. Emergency workers had continued rescue operations through Sunday night into the early hours of Monday with the help of a crane and lights, but a persistent fire underneath the rubble hampered their work, making it difficult for firefighters to deploy sniffer dogs. \u201cGiven the particular difficulties of intervention, the extraction  will take time,\u201d the fire department said in a statement announcing the bodies had been found. \u201cThe judicial authority will then proceed to identify\u201d the victims, it added. Earlier on Sunday, before the discovery of the bodies, local prosecutor Dominique Laurens said eight people \u201cwere not responding to phone calls\u201d. Five people from neighbouring buildings sustained minor injuries in the blast and collapse, which occurred abot 1.40am on Sunday local time. \u201cTonight, the pain and sorrow are great,\u201d Marseille\u2019s mayor, Benoit Payan, said in a statement. \u201cAll services of the city, as well as the state, are still at this very moment fully committed to continue the search.\u201d The cause of the explosion is still to be determined, but investigators are looking at the possibility it was the result of a gas leak. More than 100 firefighters were battling the blaze in the ruins of the building, which was believed to have one apartment on each floor. \u201cWe have nothing, not even an ID card. We have lost everything,\u201d said a man who gave his name as Roland in an interview with local newspaper La Provence. He managed to get out of the building on 15 Rue de Tivoli with his wife and two children before it collapsed, together with a neighbouring building, after the explosion around 12.40am local time. A third building partly collapsed. Five people were taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. The interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, who visited the site, said 30 buildings in the area were evacuated. Saveria Mosnier, who lives in a street near the site in the La Plaine neighbourhood, said: \u201cI was sleeping and there was this huge blast that really shook the room. I was shocked awake as if I had been dreaming. \u201cWe very quickly smelled a strong gas odour that hung around. We could still smell it this morning.\u201d It was unclear how many people were inside the collapsed buildings. \u201cNot all the people who were supposedly inside \u2026 have been seen. Families are worried,\u201d the French housing minister, Olivier Klein, told the broadcaster Franceinfo. Christophe Mirmand, the prefect of the southern Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne region, said: \u201cWe have to be very cautious about what the cause was at this stage.\u201d Gas was \u201cone possible option\u201d. Gilles, who lives on a sidestreet near the building, told AFP the sound of the crash \u201cwas huge\u201d. \u201cIt sounded like an explosion,\u201d he said, declining to provide his last name. Almost 200 residents were evacuated and 50 requested to be urgently rehoused. An aid centre for people looking for missing family members or loved ones has been opened in a neighbouring district. Eight were killed in Marseille in 2018 when two dilapidated buildings in the working-class district of Noailles caved in. It cast a harsh light on the city\u2019s housing standards, with aid groups saying 40,000 people live in shoddy structures. But authorities appeared to rule out structural issues in the latest collapse, in a neighbourhood known for its bars and nightlife. \u201cThere was no danger notice for this building, and it is not in a neighbourhood identified as having substandard housing,\u201d said Mirmand. Further back in Marseille\u2019s history, eight people were killed in a building collapse in 1981, five in an explosion in 1985, and four in a 1996 gas blast that demolished a seven-storey building.

A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet. The final accident report by the French authorities answered many questions - but some are still a mystery. Investigators ruled out terrorism early on and their position did not change when it was revealed that they believed Lubitz had deliberately crashed the aircraft. That was upheld in the final report, which found that he had been suffering from psychiatric issues he had hidden from his colleagues. The co-pilot did not behave in a peculiar or extreme manner and people who knew him expressed shock over the event. \"He's not the type of guy who would try and kill other people - absolutely not,\" a neighbour said. \"He was really just a very normal, not very remarkable, nice young man,\" said Klaus Radke, the president of the club near Montabaur in Germany where Lubitz had learned to fly. Lubitz had battled depression before, suspending his training for medical reasons in 2008. The final crash investigation report detailed his medical history and showed he had started to suffer from a \"severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms\". During that period, he considered suicide and \"made several 'no suicide pacts' with his treating psychiatrist and was hospitalised\", the report says. In April 2009, his medical certificate was not revalidated \"due to depression and the taking of medication to treat it\". In July that year, he was declared \"entirely healthy\" and given a one-year medical certificate, with a note that it must be renewed each year. It was renewed annually without incident until December 2014. It was then that Lubitz consulted doctors about \"vision problems and sleep disorders\" but eye specialists could not find a physical cause. Instead, investigators say, he was diagnosed with a \"psychosomatic disorder\" - a physical illness caused by a mental factor. In February 2015, he was given a sick certificate for eight days, which he did not forward to the airline. Over the next month, he would be issued several more medical certificates, none of which his employer saw; was prescribed insomnia and antidepressant medication; and was referred \"for psychiatric hospital treatment due to a possible psychosis\". Traces of the medications were found in his remains during a post-mortem toxicology exam. \"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode, and was taking psychotropic medication,\" the report found. \"This made him unfit to fly.\" Prosecutors in Duesseldorf at the time of the crash found torn-up sick notes, including for the day of the crash. In April 2015, German prosecutors said Lubitz had researched \"ways to commit suicide\" on his tablet at home in the week before the crash. Another of his internet searches was for \"cockpit doors and their security provisions\". The German tabloid paper Bild said (in German) it had seen documents that said he was suffering from a \"personal life crisis\", having recently broken up with a girlfriend. But even when we have a fuller picture of Lubitz's state of mind before the crash, some of his actions may remain a mystery forever. For example, after he had decided to kill himself and everyone else on board the plane, why did he set the aircraft on a controlled, rather than a sudden, descent? Depression is a serious illness, and it affects everyone differently. People experiencing depression can reach such a state of alienation that they risk taking their lives - but the vast majority of people with depression would never harm anyone other than themselves. Writing in the Times, Jennifer Wild, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, has said that the irrational thinking evident from Lubitz's actions in the cockpit may have been triggered by depression, possibly caused by a recent traumatic episode. \"Perhaps in his state he did not consider the consequences of his actions, or perhaps he did not care because he was consumed with ending his life,\" she wrote, adding that drug-taking or a bout of extreme anger might also explain his actions. The black box recording of Lubitz's calm breathing as he pressed the controls to send the aeroplane hurtling to the ground may lead some to believe he was a psychopath but Dr Wild notes that psychopaths generally avoid harming themselves. Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that millions of people in Britain suffered from depression, which is a treatable illness. He told the BBC that this included pilots who \"resume flying, perfectly safely, for maybe tens of years afterwards\". The fact that Lubitz appears to have been signed off as sick raises the question of whether there was - or should have been - contact between his doctors and the airline. Medical practitioners take an oath to maintain patient confidentiality but some US states have expanded doctors' duty of care to the community at large. This allows them to warn third\n\nquestion: When did Lubitz inform Lufthansa about his previous episode of severe depression?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "December 2014.", "usage": 1141}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In Germany, trainee pilots are subjected to medical examinations which include oral psychological assessments. There is some debate as to whether such assessments are thorough enough. One question an examiner might ask a pilot is, \"Do you have a butterfly collection at home?\", the Suddeitsche Zeitung reported (in German). At the time of the crash, Lufthansa said that after they hired pilots they did not subject them to regular psychological examinations. This is obligatory in other countries, such as the US and UK. Airline staff are encouraged to report strange behaviour on the part of their colleagues but a former pilot told the BBC that peer pressure could act as a brake on this process. And Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa's chief, admitted: \"All the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case.\" But Mr Spohr also said: \"No matter your safety regulations, no matter how high you set the bar, and we have incredibly high standards, there is no way to rule out such an event. This is an awful one-off event.\" Aircraft-assisted pilot suicides are rare. A 2014 study by the Federal Aviation Authority identified eight such instances in the US between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 0.29% of all fatal aviation aircraft accidents. All the pilots involved had been medically screened and none had demonstrated mental disorder, depression or suicidal thoughts. Some people are asking why there is no system for wresting control of a plane from a control tower. In fact, such a system does exist, reports the Daily Mail, but it is not being used. In 2006, Boeing was awarded a patent for an \"uninterrupted autopilot system\" with its own power supply that could be activated by those on board a plane or on the ground. However, safety concerns - including the possibility that such a system could be hacked - have prevented its roll-out. The crash also raises questions about the cockpit door mechanism which Lubitz used to keep the pilot out. The system, which allows a pilot to override the coded entry mechanism on the outside of the door, was designed in the event of a terrorist emergency. Airlines are going to have to balance those concerns against the possibility that individuals like Lubitz might decide to do harm, said the BBC's transport correspondent Richard Westcott. Lubitz was able to fly the plane into the ground without interruption since he seized the opportunity to lock the cockpit doors while the plane's pilot was going to the toilet. Some airlines enforce a \"rule of two\" - that there should never be fewer than two people left in the cockpit. For these airlines, a member of the cabin crew enters the cockpit when appropriate to ensure this rule is followed. After the Germanwings crash, several airlines, including Lufthansa, announced they were adopting this rule. The European Aviation Safety Agency has recommended that at least two people be present in the cockpit at all times. China's aviation authority has also introduced the rule and the UK's Civil Aviation Authority has contacted all UK airlines \"to require them to review all relevant procedures\". What relatives of plane crash victims need most are answers, experts say. But the more we learn about Lubitz, the more heartbreaking the Germanwings crash seems. Evidence from research suggests that trauma inflicted by other humans on purpose is more difficult to come to terms with than natural disasters, clinical psychologist Roderick Orner told the BBC. Acts of violence are also harder to process than accidents due to negligence or mechanical failure. \"Violence is often experienced as an attack on human integrity,\" says psychiatrist Lars Weiseth. \"This aspect causes increasing anger, loss of trust in companies and people, and sharply increases the risk to mental health.\" The fact that Lubitz seemingly had no agenda for his actions does not necessarily make things easier, since the deaths could seem meaningless. If he had been a terrorist, Prof Weiseth says, relatives might be able to see their family members as \"involuntary participants in an important struggle for democratic values\".

The statement is potentially damaging for the airline and its CEO Carsten Spohr, who told reporters last week that the carrier knew of no reason why 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz might deliberately crash a plane. The fact that Lufthansa officials were aware that Lubitz suffered from depression raises questions about its screening process for pilots as it faces the threat of legal action from relatives of the victims. Lufthansa said Lubitz broke off his pilot training for a period of several months but then passed medical checks confirming his fitness to fly. When Lubitz resumed training in 2009, he provided the flight school with medical documents showing that he had gone through a \u201cprevious episode of severe depression,\u201d Lufthansa said, citing emailed correspondence between Lubitz and the flight school. Duesseldorf state prosecutors said on Monday Lubitz had been treated for suicidal tendencies before getting his pilot\u2019s licence. They last week found torn-up sick notes showing that Lubitz was suffering from an illness that should have grounded him. Related Coverage See more stories Germanwings said it had not received a sick note from Lubitz for the day of the crash. Lubitz had a valid medical certificate at the time of the crash of the Airbus A320 operated by its budget unit, Lufthansa added. Lufthansa said it had passed the email correspondence and additional documents to the Duesseldorf prosecutors after internal investigations. Lufthansa was already facing unlimited liability for damages in the crash, lawyers have said, and has told its insurers to set aside $300 million to deal with claims, recovery costs and the loss of the aircraft. For Germanwings to limit its liability, it would have to establish that it and its employees and agents were not in any way at fault or that the accident had been caused solely by the fault of a third party. Lubitz\u2019s statement about severe depression raises more questions about what the flight school and Lufthansa did, or did not do, to make sure he was fit to fly, said New York lawyer Justin Green, who represents families in aviation disasters. \u201cBased on the facts as they are now known, I find it hard to accept that the airline did not have the opportunity to discover that he was a danger,\u201d Green wrote in an email. \u201cI do not expect the airline will try to have a liability fight under the circumstances.\u201d European pilots pass psychiatric screening ahead of starting training but annual medical checks do not include a specific in-depth psychiatric test. Pilots are expected to inform medical examiners at their annual checks of any health issues that could affect their flying ability. Psychiatrists and pilots have said there is no fail-safe test to spot suicidal pilots, but lawyers representing some of the families of victims of the Germanwings crash called on Tuesday for more regular psychiatric testing of pilots. French air accident investigators also said on Tuesday that their probe into the crash would look at psychological screening procedures for pilots and cockpit access, indicating the two areas where they are most likely to make safety recommendations that could affect the whole aviation industry. \u201cIn these cases, when you\u2019re acting for families, they\u2019re keen to see that lessons are learned, that pressure is put on airline authorities to improve flight safety,\u201d Jim Morris, a partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell, told Reuters.

Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin, in charge of the criminal inquiry into the crash, told CNN that \u201cso far no videos were used in the crash investigation.\u201d He added, \u201cA person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators.\u201d Robin\u2019s comments follow claims by two publications, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board the flight as it crashed into the French Alps on March 24. Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz is accused of deliberately bringing down the plane, killing all 150 on board. Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site. The two publications described the supposed video but did not post it on their websites. They said that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. Germanwings plane crashes in France \u201cOne can hear cries of \u2018My God\u2019 in several languages,\u201d Paris Match reported. \u201cMetallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object. Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing.\u201d \u201cIt is a very disturbing scene,\u201d said Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online. An official with France\u2019s air accident investigation agency, the BEA, said the agency was not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the reports were \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d and \u201cunwarranted.\u201d Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but added that they \u201chadn\u2019t been exploited yet.\u201d Opinion: What if my patient is a pilot? Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny-sous-Bois, near Paris, to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand in hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far has been sent to the institute, Menichini said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media, Menichini answered with a categorical \u201cno.\u201d Reichelt told CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett: Outfront\u201d that he had watched the video and stood by the report, saying Bild and Paris Match are \u201cvery confident\u201d that the clip is real. He noted that investigators only revealed they\u2019d recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports. \u201cThat is something we did not know before. \u2026 Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren\u2019t revealed by the investigation at the beginning,\u201d he said. What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot? Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr expressed his \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d Wednesday over the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 and promised to help the victims\u2019 families for as long as they need. Lufthansa CEO visits crash site, avoids questions Speaking as he visited the crash site in the French Alps, he said, \u201cThere is not a single hour where we don\u2019t think about this terrible accident, the victims and the relatives and friends of these victims. \u201cWe are learning more every day about the cause of the accident, but I think it will take a long, long time for everybody, all of us, to understand how this could happen.\u201d Spohr also thanked all those involved in the investigation and recovery efforts as well as local residents for their response to the devastating crash. He added a wreath to the pile of flowers left by grieving families at a simple stone memorial set up in the village of Le Vernet, the closest accessible point to the crash site. A memorial service was also to take place Wednesday in the town of Haltern, Germany, which lost 16 students and two teachers in the crash. Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525. Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a \u201cprevious episode of severe depression,\u201d the German airline said Tuesday.\n\nquestion: What does Lubitz's history of depression raise questions about?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Lubitz's history of depression raises questions about the mental state of the Germanwings co-pilot.", "usage": 1081}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The announcement indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz\u2019s battle with depression, allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit. Germanwings crash compensation: What we know Lufthansa, whose CEO Spohr had previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a \u201cswift and seamless clarification\u201d and said it was sharing the information and documents \u2013 including training and medical records \u2013 with public prosecutors. Recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside. Menichini told CNN late Tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching. French President Francois Hollande, speaking Tuesday, said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week, sooner than authorities had previously suggested. In the meantime, the recovery of the victims\u2019 personal belongings will start Wednesday, Menichini said.

Meanwhile, French investigative newspaper Le Canard Enchaine reported Wednesday that the Gendarmerie Nationale, or National Police, had questioned Remy Jouty, the head of the BEA, regarding leaks in the investigation \u2013 specifically a report in The New York Times about the contents of the cockpit voice recorder. BEA spokeswoman Martine Del Bono confirmed to CNN that the Gendarmerie Nationale questioned Jouty regarding the Germanwings investigation but refused to elaborate. She said he was questioned on the evening of March 25. That same day, The New York Times reported that the Germanwings pilot was locked out of the cockpit just before the crash. \u201cAn investigator said evidence from a cockpit voice recorder indicated one pilot left the cockpit before the plane\u2019s descent and was unable to get back in,\u201d reporter Nicola Clark wrote. Wednesday\u2019s article in Le Canard Enchain\u00e9, citing a government source, said: \u201cThey (the Gendarmerie) reproached him (Jouty) for not informing the Prosecutor first regarding the content of the cockpit voice recorder. \u201cThe Marseille prosecutor, Brice Robin, in charge of the investigation and the Gendarmerie found out about the cockpit voice recorder content in \u2026 the press!\u201d said Le Canard Enchain\u00e9. Separately, the French National Union of Airline Pilots confirmed that it had filed a complaint against a person it identified merely as \u201cX\u201d last week for breach of confidentiality after \u201ca source close to the investigation\u201d leaked information to The New York Times. \u201cThe article states that the source is a high official part of the team of investigators and that he had access to audio recordings from the recorder,\u201d the union\u2019s statement said. The union said information taken from the recording was \u201ccommunicated to the press before it was given to the judicial inquiry and especially families.\u201d It claimed European rules had been violated by those who had access to the recordings.

He first took to the skies as a member of a gliding club in his hometown of Montabaur in west Germany before fulfilling his ambition of becoming a professional pilot. Friends and neighbours described him as a \"quiet\" but \"fun\" character, who enjoyed his job. A picture from his now defunct Facebook page shows him smiling happily in front of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In the aftermath of the disaster, investigators have established a very different side to his character. Police found torn-up sick notes in his homes, including one covering the day of the crash. Despite assertions from friends that he was in good spirits, the final report on the crash by French investigators found he had suffered from a psychiatric condition and had been taking medication before the crash. Fearing he was losing his vision, he had hidden the evidence from his employer. The Bild newspaper also reported that he may have been going through a \"personal life crisis\" at the time of the crash. Lsubitz lived at his parents' home in Montabaur, a town near Frankfurt of about 12,500 people. His father Guenther worked in banking and his mother was a church organist. He was about 14 when he joined the LSC Westerwald glider club in Montabaur, where he learned to fly in a sleek white ASK-21 two-seater and went on to obtain his full licence, according to club chairman Klaus Radke. He was also a keen runner, competing in several races. In 2007, he graduated from high school and was accepted as a Lufthansa trainee the following year, enrolling at the company's training school in Bremen. Lubitz had a break in training about six years ago, lasting several months, according to Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr. Mr Spohr refused to disclose the reason for this gap but said his suitability had been reassessed and Lubitz had resumed his studies. But the final report of the investigation into the crash finds the interruption was caused by medical problems. He suffered a serious depressive episode during his treatment and went on to receive treatment for a year and a half. During that time, he considered suicide but was eventually declared healthy. It was recommended by a doctor that he needed special regular medical inspection and his medical certificates were valid for only one year at a time. A relevant note was added to his aviation authority file as well as to his pilot's licence. In 2013 he joined Lufthansa's low budget airline, Germanwings. He initially worked as a flight attendant before starting his role as co-pilot. His duties would have included monitoring instruments, communicating with air traffic controllers and sharing control of the aircraft with the captain. He would have also been expected to steer the plane during the pilot's breaks, or if he or she became ill. Lufthansa said Lubitz had flown a total of 630 hours before the fatal crash. He underwent a regular security check on 27 January and nothing untoward was found. Previous security checks in 2008 and 2010 also showed no issues. \"He was 100% fit to fly without any restrictions or conditions,\" Mr Spohr said. Yet the crash investigation found differently. He had battled with vision problems and insomnia for several months, it said, caused by a psychiatric disorder rather than anything physical. He was taking medication for both psychiatric issues and insomnia, and had been given doctor's notes excusing him from work. But he never showed them to the airline. \"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode and was taking psychotropic medication,\" the report found. \"This made him unfit to fly.\" But the report found he had hidden the evidence, and neither the airline nor his colleagues could have known about his circumstances. Those who knew Lubitz have described him as an affable young man, who gave no indications he was harbouring any harmful intent. This video can not be played Members of the flight club where Andreas Lubitz was a member have been talking about his personality Klaus Radke told the Associated Press that he had seen him when he returned to the club to renew his glider licence in the autumn of 2014. \"He seemed very enthusiastic about his career,\" he said. \"I can't remember anything where something wasn't right.\" Peter Ruecker, a long-time member of club, also insisted Lubitz had seemed \"very happy\" during their last meeting. \"I'm just speechless,\" he said. \"I don't have any explanation for this. Knowing Andreas, this is just inconceivable for me.\" A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet.

The discovery of the bodies came about 24 hours after the blast brought down the four-storey building in the Mediterranean port city in southern France. Emergency workers had continued rescue operations through Sunday night into the early hours of Monday with the help of a crane and lights, but a persistent fire underneath the rubble hampered their work, making it difficult for firefighters to deploy sniffer dogs. \u201cGiven the particular difficulties of intervention, the extraction  will take time,\u201d the fire department said in a statement announcing the bodies had been found. \u201cThe judicial authority will then proceed to identify\u201d the victims, it added. Earlier on Sunday, before the discovery of the bodies, local prosecutor Dominique Laurens said eight people \u201cwere not responding to phone calls\u201d. Five people from neighbouring buildings sustained minor injuries in the blast and collapse, which occurred abot 1.40am on Sunday local time. \u201cTonight, the pain and sorrow are great,\u201d Marseille\u2019s mayor, Benoit Payan, said in a statement. \u201cAll services of the city, as well as the state, are still at this very moment fully committed to continue the search.\u201d The cause of the explosion is still to be determined, but investigators are looking at the possibility it was the result of a gas leak. More than 100 firefighters were battling the blaze in the ruins of the building, which was believed to have one apartment on each floor. \u201cWe have nothing, not even an ID card. We have lost everything,\u201d said a man who gave his name as Roland in an interview with local newspaper La Provence. He managed to get out of the building on 15 Rue de Tivoli with his wife and two children before it collapsed, together with a neighbouring building, after the explosion around 12.40am local time. A third building partly collapsed. Five people were taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. The interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, who visited the site, said 30 buildings in the area were evacuated. Saveria Mosnier, who lives in a street near the site in the La Plaine neighbourhood, said: \u201cI was sleeping and there was this huge blast that really shook the room. I was shocked awake as if I had been dreaming. \u201cWe very quickly smelled a strong gas odour that hung around. We could still smell it this morning.\u201d It was unclear how many people were inside the collapsed buildings. \u201cNot all the people who were supposedly inside \u2026 have been seen. Families are worried,\u201d the French housing minister, Olivier Klein, told the broadcaster Franceinfo. Christophe Mirmand, the prefect of the southern Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne region, said: \u201cWe have to be very cautious about what the cause was at this stage.\u201d Gas was \u201cone possible option\u201d. Gilles, who lives on a sidestreet near the building, told AFP the sound of the crash \u201cwas huge\u201d. \u201cIt sounded like an explosion,\u201d he said, declining to provide his last name. Almost 200 residents were evacuated and 50 requested to be urgently rehoused. An aid centre for people looking for missing family members or loved ones has been opened in a neighbouring district. Eight were killed in Marseille in 2018 when two dilapidated buildings in the working-class district of Noailles caved in. It cast a harsh light on the city\u2019s housing standards, with aid groups saying 40,000 people live in shoddy structures. But authorities appeared to rule out structural issues in the latest collapse, in a neighbourhood known for its bars and nightlife. \u201cThere was no danger notice for this building, and it is not in a neighbourhood identified as having substandard housing,\u201d said Mirmand. Further back in Marseille\u2019s history, eight people were killed in a building collapse in 1981, five in an explosion in 1985, and four in a 1996 gas blast that demolished a seven-storey building.

A German criminal investigation into the crash concluded in January that Lubitz bore sole responsibility for crashing the jet. The final accident report by the French authorities answered many questions - but some are still a mystery. Investigators ruled out terrorism early on and their position did not change when it was revealed that they believed Lubitz had deliberately crashed the aircraft. That was upheld in the final report, which found that he had been suffering from psychiatric issues he had hidden from his colleagues. The co-pilot did not behave in a peculiar or extreme manner and people who knew him expressed shock over the event. \"He's not the type of guy who would try and kill other people - absolutely not,\" a neighbour said. \"He was really just a very normal, not very remarkable, nice young man,\" said Klaus Radke, the president of the club near Montabaur in Germany where Lubitz had learned to fly. Lubitz had battled depression before, suspending his training for medical reasons in 2008. The final crash investigation report detailed his medical history and showed he had started to suffer from a \"severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms\". During that period, he considered suicide and \"made several 'no suicide pacts' with his treating psychiatrist and was hospitalised\", the report says. In April 2009, his medical certificate was not revalidated \"due to depression and the taking of medication to treat it\". In July that year, he was declared \"entirely healthy\" and given a one-year medical certificate, with a note that it must be renewed each year. It was renewed annually without incident until December 2014. It was then that Lubitz consulted doctors about \"vision problems and sleep disorders\" but eye specialists could not find a physical cause. Instead, investigators say, he was diagnosed with a \"psychosomatic disorder\" - a physical illness caused by a mental factor. In February 2015, he was given a sick certificate for eight days, which he did not forward to the airline. Over the next month, he would be issued several more medical certificates, none of which his employer saw; was prescribed insomnia and antidepressant medication; and was referred \"for psychiatric hospital treatment due to a possible psychosis\". Traces of the medications were found in his remains during a post-mortem toxicology exam. \"On the day of the accident, the pilot was still suffering from a psychiatric disorder, which was possibly a psychotic depressive episode, and was taking psychotropic medication,\" the report found. \"This made him unfit to fly.\" Prosecutors in Duesseldorf at the time of the crash found torn-up sick notes, including for the day of the crash. In April 2015, German prosecutors said Lubitz had researched \"ways to commit suicide\" on his tablet at home in the week before the crash. Another of his internet searches was for \"cockpit doors and their security provisions\". The German tabloid paper Bild said (in German) it had seen documents that said he was suffering from a \"personal life crisis\", having recently broken up with a girlfriend. But even when we have a fuller picture of Lubitz's state of mind before the crash, some of his actions may remain a mystery forever. For example, after he had decided to kill himself and everyone else on board the plane, why did he set the aircraft on a controlled, rather than a sudden, descent? Depression is a serious illness, and it affects everyone differently. People experiencing depression can reach such a state of alienation that they risk taking their lives - but the vast majority of people with depression would never harm anyone other than themselves. Writing in the Times, Jennifer Wild, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, has said that the irrational thinking evident from Lubitz's actions in the cockpit may have been triggered by depression, possibly caused by a recent traumatic episode. \"Perhaps in his state he did not consider the consequences of his actions, or perhaps he did not care because he was consumed with ending his life,\" she wrote, adding that drug-taking or a bout of extreme anger might also explain his actions. The black box recording of Lubitz's calm breathing as he pressed the controls to send the aeroplane hurtling to the ground may lead some to believe he was a psychopath but Dr Wild notes that psychopaths generally avoid harming themselves. Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that millions of people in Britain suffered from depression, which is a treatable illness. He told the BBC that this included pilots who \"resume flying, perfectly safely, for maybe tens of years afterwards\". The fact that Lubitz appears to have been signed off as sick raises the question of whether there was - or should have been - contact between his doctors and the airline. Medical practitioners take an oath to maintain patient confidentiality but some US states have expanded doctors' duty of care to the community at large.

In Germany, trainee pilots are subjected to medical examinations which include oral psychological assessments. There is some debate as to whether such assessments are thorough enough. One question an examiner might ask a pilot is, \"Do you have a butterfly collection at home?\", the Suddeitsche Zeitung reported (in German). At the time of the crash, Lufthansa said that after they hired pilots they did not subject them to regular psychological examinations. This is obligatory in other countries, such as the US and UK. Airline staff are encouraged to report strange behaviour on the part of their colleagues but a former pilot told the BBC that peer pressure could act as a brake on this process. And Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa's chief, admitted: \"All the safety nets we are all so proud of here have not worked in this case.\" But Mr Spohr also said: \"No matter your safety regulations, no matter how high you set the bar, and we have incredibly high standards, there is no way to rule out such an event. This is an awful one-off event.\" Aircraft-assisted pilot suicides are rare. A 2014 study by the Federal Aviation Authority identified eight such instances in the US between 2003 and 2012, accounting for 0.29% of all fatal aviation aircraft accidents. All the pilots involved had been medically screened and none had demonstrated mental disorder, depression or suicidal thoughts. Some people are asking why there is no system for wresting control of a plane from a control tower. In fact, such a system does exist, reports the Daily Mail, but it is not being used. In 2006, Boeing was awarded a patent for an \"uninterrupted autopilot system\" with its own power supply that could be activated by those on board a plane or on the ground. However, safety concerns - including the possibility that such a system could be hacked - have prevented its roll-out. The crash also raises questions about the cockpit door mechanism which Lubitz used to keep the pilot out. The system, which allows a pilot to override the coded entry mechanism on the outside of the door, was designed in the event of a terrorist emergency. Airlines are going to have to balance those concerns against the possibility that individuals like Lubitz might decide to do harm, said the BBC's transport correspondent Richard Westcott. Lubitz was able to fly the plane into the ground without interruption since he seized the opportunity to lock the cockpit doors while the plane's pilot was going to the toilet. Some airlines enforce a \"rule of two\" - that there should never be fewer than two people left in the cockpit. For these airlines, a member of the cabin crew enters the cockpit when appropriate to ensure this rule is followed. After the Germanwings crash, several airlines, including Lufthansa, announced they were adopting this rule. The European Aviation Safety Agency has recommended that at least two people be present in the cockpit at all times. China's aviation authority has also introduced the rule and the UK's Civil Aviation Authority has contacted all UK airlines \"to require them to review all relevant procedures\". What relatives of plane crash victims need most are answers, experts say. But the more we learn about Lubitz, the more heartbreaking the Germanwings crash seems. Evidence from research suggests that trauma inflicted by other humans on purpose is more difficult to come to terms with than natural disasters, clinical psychologist Roderick Orner told the BBC. Acts of violence are also harder to process than accidents due to negligence or mechanical failure. \"Violence is often experienced as an attack on human integrity,\" says psychiatrist Lars Weiseth. \"This aspect causes increasing anger, loss of trust in companies and people, and sharply increases the risk to mental health.\" The fact that Lubitz seemingly had no agenda for his actions does not necessarily make things easier, since the deaths could seem meaningless. If he had been a terrorist, Prof Weiseth says, relatives might be able to see their family members as \"involuntary participants in an important struggle for democratic values\".

The statement is potentially damaging for the airline and its CEO Carsten Spohr, who told reporters last week that the carrier knew of no reason why 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz might deliberately crash a plane. The fact that Lufthansa officials were aware that Lubitz suffered from depression raises questions about its screening process for pilots as it faces the threat of legal action from relatives of the victims. Lufthansa said Lubitz broke off his pilot training for a period of several months but then passed medical checks confirming his fitness to fly. When Lubitz resumed training in 2009, he provided the flight school with medical documents showing that he had gone through a \u201cprevious episode of severe depression,\u201d Lufthansa said, citing emailed correspondence between Lubitz and the flight school. Duesseldorf state prosecutors said on Monday Lubitz had been treated for suicidal tendencies before getting his pilot\u2019s licence. They last week found torn-up sick notes showing that Lubitz was suffering from an illness that should have grounded him. Related Coverage See more stories Germanwings said it had not received a sick note from Lubitz for the day of the crash. Lubitz had a valid medical certificate at the time of the crash of the Airbus A320 operated by its budget unit, Lufthansa added. Lufthansa said it had passed the email correspondence and additional documents to the Duesseldorf prosecutors after internal investigations. Lufthansa was already facing unlimited liability for damages in the crash, lawyers have said, and has told its insurers to set aside $300 million to deal with claims, recovery costs and the loss of the aircraft. For Germanwings to limit its liability, it would have to establish that it and its employees and agents were not in any way at fault or that the accident had been caused solely by the fault of a third party. Lubitz\u2019s statement about severe depression raises more questions about what the flight school and Lufthansa did, or did not do, to make sure he was fit to fly, said New York lawyer Justin Green, who represents families in aviation disasters. \u201cBased on the facts as they are now known, I find it hard to accept that the airline did not have the opportunity to discover that he was a danger,\u201d Green wrote in an email. \u201cI do not expect the airline will try to have a liability fight under the circumstances.\u201d European pilots pass psychiatric screening ahead of starting training but annual medical checks do not include a specific in-depth psychiatric test. Pilots are expected to inform medical examiners at their annual checks of any health issues that could affect their flying ability. Psychiatrists and pilots have said there is no fail-safe test to spot suicidal pilots, but lawyers representing some of the families of victims of the Germanwings crash called on Tuesday for more regular psychiatric testing of pilots. French air accident investigators also said on Tuesday that their probe into the crash would look at psychological screening procedures for pilots and cockpit access, indicating the two areas where they are most likely to make safety recommendations that could affect the whole aviation industry. \u201cIn these cases, when you\u2019re acting for families, they\u2019re keen to see that lessons are learned, that pressure is put on airline authorities to improve flight safety,\u201d Jim Morris, a partner at law firm Irwin Mitchell, told Reuters.
