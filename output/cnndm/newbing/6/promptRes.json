Robert H. Schuller, California televangelist and founder of the television ministry \"Hour of Power,\" died Thursday, according to his family. He was 88 years old. Schuller, also the founder of Crystal Cathedral megachurch, had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in August 2013, a release from \"Hour of Power\" said. \"My father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning. He was a great Dad and a great man of God,\" said Schuller's daughter-in-law, Donna Schuller, in a Twitter message. Schuller's life followed an almost Shakespearean arc. He was born in a Iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days. In his autobiography, \"Prayer: My Soul's Adventure with God,\" he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation. After attending a Hope College and Western Theological Seminary in Michigan, he met his wife of more than 60 years, Arvella, while preaching at her church (she was the organist). With their young family in tow, the Schullers caravanned west to California, where he rented a drive-in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar. It was beneath the dignity of Christian ministry, some local pastors huffed. The \"passion pits\" where teenagers necked was no place for the gospel. Schuller was undeterred, and he quickly outgrew the drive-in. He called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a \"miracle,\" though his many mainstream critics had other names for it. His confident, breezy version of Christianity -- too breezy, by some estimations -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed Christians who were put off by the hellfire fulminations of many post-War American preachers. Schuller sold a softer, gentler message, which borrowed heavily, he acknowledged, from the father of the feel-good gospel, Norman Vincent Peale. He preached not to convert or condemn people, but to encourage them, a sentiment he called \"possibility thinking.\" People loved it. \"Evangelicalism at its best wants to be innovative and reach people,\" said Timothy Larsen, a professor of Christian thought at Wheaton College in Illinois. \"And Schuller was a master at that.\" \"What he got right is that the gospel is good news,\" Larsen continued. \"And he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope.\" Some of Schuller's favored phrases, though, struck others as cornpone Christianity. \"Turn your hurt into a halo?\" said Randall Balmer, a professor of American religious history at Dartmouth College, citing one such phrase. \"That's pretty weak tea.\" Still, Balmer gives Schuller some credit. \"It may be bad theology, but it's brilliant marketing.\" In 1970, Schuller began broadcasting \"Hour of Power,\" believed to be one of the first, if not the very first, Sunday service to be shown regularly on television. With his genial smile, priestly robes and gray hair, he looked and talked like a guy who wanted nothing more than to see his flock succeed. The show, which ran for decades, reached millions, making Schuller a televangelist before the term became tarnished by the sins of his many successors. Schuller's crowning achievement, at least architecturally, still stands in Orange County, California, though it is now owned by the Roman Catholic Church. The Crystal Cathedral, a great gleaming edifice with 10,000 glass panels, gave worshipers a look at the  clouds that house the heavens, while Schuller preached in the pulpit below. The message was clear to many: The road to the former ran through the latter. During the 1980s and 1990s, Schuller's star continued to rise, with presidents stopping by the Crystal Cathedral -- often during campaigns, it should be said -- and future megachurch pastors like Rick Warren and Bill Hybels seeking his advice. As Schuller aged, though, his family was beset by a succession scandal straight from the pages of \"King Lear.\"  He tried to install his only son, Bobby Jr., as pastor of Crystal Cathedral. But the preaching styles of father and son were too different for the congregation -- measured at times at 10,000 strong -- to countenance. Bobby Schuller Jr. left \"Hour of Power\" and the pulpit at Crystal Cathedral after a short time. As the family searched for a new successor and tussled over finances, viewers and donations to the church and its television show dropped precipitously. Crystal Cathedral Ministries filed for bankruptcy in 2010, citing debts of more than $43 million, according to The Associated Press.

He was a great Dad and a great man of God,\" said Schuller's daughter-in-law, Donna Schuller, in a Twitter message. Schuller's life followed an almost Shakespearean arc. He was born in a Iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days. In his autobiography, \"Prayer: My Soul's Adventure with God,\" he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation. After attending a Hope College and Western Theological Seminary in Michigan, he met his wife of more than 60 years, Arvella, while preaching at her church (she was the organist). With their young family in tow, the Schullers caravanned west to California, where he rented a drive-in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar. It was beneath the dignity of Christian ministry, some local pastors huffed. The \"passion pits\" where teenagers necked was no place for the gospel. Schuller was undeterred, and he quickly outgrew the drive-in. He called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a \"miracle,\" though his many mainstream critics had other names for it. His confident, breezy version of Christianity -- too breezy, by some estimations -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed Christians who were put off by the hellfire fulminations of many post-War American preachers. Schuller sold a softer, gentler message, which borrowed heavily, he acknowledged, from the father of the feel-good gospel, Norman Vincent Peale. He preached not to convert or condemn people, but to encourage them, a sentiment he called \"possibility thinking.\" People loved it. \"Evangelicalism at its best wants to be innovative and reach people,\" said Timothy Larsen, a professor of Christian thought at Wheaton College in Illinois. \"And Schuller was a master at that.\" \"What he got right is that the gospel is good news,\" Larsen continued. \"And he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope.\" Some of Schuller's favored phrases, though, struck others as cornpone Christianity. \"Turn your hurt into a halo?\" said Randall Balmer, a professor of American religious history at Dartmouth College, citing one such phrase. \"That's pretty weak tea.\" Still, Balmer gives Schuller some credit. \"It may be bad theology, but it's brilliant marketing.\" In 1970, Schuller began broadcasting \"Hour of Power,\" believed to be one of the first, if not the very first, Sunday service to be shown regularly on television. With his genial smile, priestly robes and gray hair, he looked and talked like a guy who wanted nothing more than to see his flock succeed. The show, which ran for decades, reached millions, making Schuller a televangelist before the term became tarnished by the sins of his many successors. Schuller's crowning achievement, at least architecturally, still stands in Orange County, California, though it is now owned by the Roman Catholic Church. The Crystal Cathedral, a great gleaming edifice with 10,000 glass panels, gave worshipers a look at the  clouds that house the heavens, while Schuller preached in the pulpit below. The message was clear to many: The road to the former ran through the latter. During the 1980s and 1990s, Schuller's star continued to rise, with presidents stopping by the Crystal Cathedral -- often during campaigns, it should be said -- and future megachurch pastors like Rick Warren and Bill Hybels seeking his advice. As Schuller aged, though, his family was beset by a succession scandal straight from the pages of \"King Lear.\"  He tried to install his only son, Bobby Jr., as pastor of Crystal Cathedral. But the preaching styles of father and son were too different for the congregation -- measured at times at 10,000 strong -- to countenance. Bobby Schuller Jr. left \"Hour of Power\" and the pulpit at Crystal Cathedral after a short time. As the family searched for a new successor and tussled over finances, viewers and donations to the church and its television show dropped precipitously. Crystal Cathedral Ministries filed for bankruptcy in 2010, citing debts of more than $43 million, according to The Associated Press.

Schuller\n\nevidence: Robert Harold Schuller (September 16, 1926 \u2013 April 2, 2015) was an American Christian televangelist, pastor, motivational speaker, and author. In his five decades of television, Schuller was principally known for the weekly Hour of Power television program, which he began hosting in 1970 until his retirement in 2006. His grandson, Bobby Schuller, carries on the Hour of Power now airing for over fifty years. During his time as a minister, Schuller oversaw the construction of two churches in Garden Grove, CA. The first church built under his tenure was the Garden Grove Community Church chapel, which seated 500, and the second that he oversaw was the building of the much larger Crystal Cathedral, which has a seating capacity of 2,200. Schuller began broadcasting his Hour of Power program from the smaller Garden Grove chapel in 1969. He made the decision to begin his broadcast of Hour of Power shortly after he had received encouragement from longtime friend Billy Graham during a visit with the popular evangelist. The Hour of Power broadcast later continued in the Crystal Cathedral. Like his good friend Billy Graham, the Schuller organization never became closely associated with any major scandal. During the 90's his televised sermons were regularly viewed by an estimated audience of 20 million. Schuller's weekly telecast of his sermons which began in 1969 was one of the first instances of such weekly televised church services, and was the world's most widely watched hour-long church service ever. Robert Harold Schuller was born on September 16, 1926, near Alton, Iowa, the second son of Jennie (n\u00e9e Beltman; 1891\u20131970) and Anthony Schuller (1882\u20131964). He was the youngest of five children. All of his grandparents were Dutch immigrants, and he was raised on his parents' farm nearby in a small, close-knit community of Dutch-Americans, without running water. In 1927 on the day of his baptism at his family\u2019s Reformed Church in Newkirk, Iowa, the six month old Schuller was clothed in a certain \"baptismal-gown.\u201d Years later Schuller announced that he had kept his baptismal-gown and placed it on display in his office, referring to it as his most-prized-possession. To Schuller apparently the gown had represented the day that his life had first been dedicated to God. In his later years Schuller placed an inscription beneath the gown reading: \"This is the reason my life has been a success. As a child I was dedicated to our Lord.\" In 1931, just weeks before his fifth birthday a visiting uncle who was a minister had predicted that the young boy was destined to spread the word of God to many when he grew up. Schuller called the moment that he had first heard his uncle's prediction the \"single most defining moment of my early life.\" After graduating from Newkirk High School in Newkirk, Iowa, in 1944, Schuller continued his education at Hope College, located in Holland, Michigan. In 1950, now studying at Western Theological Seminary, Schuller received his Master of Divinity degree. The seminary teaches in the theological tradition and practice of John Calvin. He was soon ordained as a minister in the Reformed Church in America. After his ordination, he first worked at Ivanhoe Reformed Church in Riverdale, Illinois, before moving to Garden Grove, California. In Garden Grove, California in 1955 Schuller opened what would be his first church in the area, which he called the \u201cGarden Grove Community Church.\u201d At the time, Schuller was trying out a relatively new concept in \u201cchurch service presentation\u201d known as the \u201cDrive-in Church Model.\u201c His new church was located in the old Orange Drive-in Movie Theater where churchgoers could enjoy their church services from the comfort of their own cars. For the benefit of those who preferred more traditional church services, he later also rented a 300-seat former Baptist church, about four miles (6 km) down the road from his new drive-in theater church. On Sunday mornings Schuller would first preside at a 9:30 service in the Baptist chapel and then he would deliver his organ to the roof of the concession stand at the old drive-in theater where he would then preside over his second Sunday service. As the size of the congregations grew, Schuller purchased 10 acres (4.0 ha) of land at 12141 Lewis Street in Garden Grove for a \"walk-in, drive-in\" church, serving both congregations. Ground was broken September 10, 1958 for construction of Schuller's second church-home in the area, which was designed by international architect Richard Neutra. This second church was completed in 1961, at a cost of $3 million (equivalent to $29 million in 2022). The dedication service was held November 5, 1961. The design\n\nquestion: When did Reverend Robert H. Schuller pass away?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "April 2, 2015", "usage": 1147}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Schuller\n\nevidence:  of the new church building enabled Schuller to preach his sermons to worshipers in 500 cars, as well as to members of the congregation inside the church. Schuller's second area church was built on what was to later become a part of the campus of his future (and much larger) \"Crystal Cathedral Church.\" Seven years later in 1968 a \"Tower of Hope\" steeple structure was added onto the north side of the property. The Tower of Hope structure rose 13 stories (approximately 130 to 150 feet (40 to 46 m) into the air and was the tallest structure in Orange County at that time. The steeple structure was then topped by an illuminated cross which added another 90 feet (27 m) to the structure's overall height. Also in 1968, Schuller purchased a 10-acre (4.0 ha) walnut grove that had bordered on the north boundary of the then current Garden Grove Community Church property. This new purchase of land was to enable the construction of a future much larger Crystal Cathedral on the newly expanded property. The architectural firm of Philip Johnson/John Burgee was soon retained to draw up plans for a primarily glass church that would be able to accommodate over 2,000 church goers, which was to be built on a spot on the newly expanded church campus adjacent to the original church structure. In order to meet the needs of the church's ever expanding congregation, the architectural firm designed a reflective glass building that could seat 2,248 people. At the time that it was built, the church was touted as \"the largest glass building in the world.\" The church was dedicated on September 14, 1980. Once the newer, larger, and more noticeable \"Crystal Cathedral\" structure was completed, Schuller renamed his organization as the \"Crystal Cathedral Ministries.\" Schuller's Crystal Cathedral Church soon became the iconic backdrop from which he preached his popular Hour of Power broadcasts every Sunday morning for the next 25 years. These broadcasts regularly reached a world wide audience of 20 million. Schuller emphasized what he believed are the positive aspects of the Christian faith. He deliberately avoided condemning people for sin, believing that Jesus \"met needs before touting creeds\". Once in a relationship with God, Schuller emphasized, someone who is sowing positive faith in his heart and actions will discover that the by-product is a reduction of sin. He was known to say, \"Sin is a condition before it is an action.\" Schuller encouraged Christians and non-Christians to achieve great things through God and to believe in their dreams. He wrote, \"If you can dream it, you can do it!\" As the Crystal Cathedral's founding pastor, Schuller was seen and heard internationally on Sundays on the world's most widely watched hour-long church service, the Hour of Power, 1,500 of which were recorded. On June 15, 1950, Schuller married Arvella De Haan (1929\u20132014), a church organist, who became instrumental in developing the music department at the Crystal Cathedral and was the creator and producer of the Hour of Power for over 40 years. The Schullers had five children: Sheila, Tim, Robert, Jeanne, Carol, and Gretchen. On January 22, 2006, Schuller's son, Robert A. Schuller, assumed the role of senior pastor of the Crystal Cathedral. On October 25, 2008, however, he resigned. His father cited \"a lack of shared vision\" as the cause. Schuller stated that \"different ideas as to the direction and the vision for this ministry\" with his son \"made it necessary... to part ways in the Hour of Power television ministry\". Schuller also said \"I love my son and am proud of my son\" and that the long-term survival of his ministry was dependent on expanding its imprint beyond the Schuller name. \"The real minister's name that we honor is Jesus, not Schuller\", he said. The ministry then opened the pulpit to a variety of notable Christian speakers. On June 11, 2009, Schuller announced that the church's leadership would pass to his eldest daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman. On July 11, 2010, he announced that he was retiring as principal pastor of the Crystal Cathedral and would become chairman of the church's board of directors. After a year as interim senior pastor, Sheila Schuller Coleman was elevated to senior pastor in July 2010. In the wake of Robert Schuller's retirement and after much sorting out, in 2013 Robert H. Schuller's grandson, Bobby V. Schuller moved the remaining congregation from the Crystal Cathedral building and eventually into the somewhat smaller Shepherd's Grove church building in nearby Irvine, CA. Along the way, from 2013 through 2018 the congregation also temporarily leased what had formerly been the St. Callistus Catholic church of Garden Grove for their Sunday services. During these years Schuller's grandson took over the leadership of the remaining congregation and also resumed the broadcast of his grandfather's Hour\n\nquestion: When did Reverend Robert H.

Subsequently, the Diocese of Orange renamed the building as the Christ Cathedral. On October 18, 2010, Coleman announced that the Crystal Cathedral was seeking bankruptcy protection, in the midst of what became known as the Great Recession. In May 2011, the senior Schullers, along with their daughter Carol and her husband Tim, were dismissed from the ministry at the Crystal Cathedral. They filed for bankruptcy. The court would eventually allow them approximately 20 percent of what they were owed. The creditors would be paid in full plus interest. In July 2011, it was reported in the Orange County Register that Schuller had been ousted from the Crystal Cathedral board. In July 2011, Coleman attempted to reverse the decision that had been made in her absence, saying, \"Dad will continue to provide leadership for this ministry through me for as long as possible\" and, \"I have and will continue to defer to his wisdom and honor him for his unprecedented accomplishments.\" On March 11, 2012, after months of attempting to change the attitude of the ministry's board, Coleman told the Crystal Cathedral congregation that she was leaving to start a new church because of \"a hostile work environment\". The International Business Times reported that this came following \"a bitter fallout between the ministry and its founding family\". According to the Religion News Service, the founders were left with little to no assets; their home was fully mortgaged. On January 24, 2013, the Crystal Cathedral's board of directors voted to make Bobby Schuller, Schuller's grandson (son of Robert Anthony Schuller), the new pastor for the Hour of Power television program as well as a non-voting member of the board. In late August 2013, Robert H. Schuller was diagnosed with esophageal cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes. A follow-up examination in September 2013 presented Schuller with the possibility of undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy that could extend his life. Schuller then agreed to receive the cancer treatments, which may have been responsible for extending his life by nearly two more years as had been predicted by his physicians. Arvella Schuller died on February 11, 2014, aged 84. The Schullers had been married for 63 years. Schuller died peacefully, early on the morning of April 2, 2015 at a nursing facility in Artesia, California, aged 88. His funeral was held at Christ Cathedral, the former campus of the Crystal Cathedral. He is interred next to his wife at the Christ Cathedral Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Garden Grove, California. Schuller authored over 30 hardcover books, 6 of which made The New York Times and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists, including:\n\nquestion: When did Reverend Robert H.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Crystal Cathedral founder and former televangelist the Rev. Robert H. Schuller has been diagnosed with cancer, his daughter said Thursday. Carol Schuller Milner told The Associated Press that Schuller, 86, has a fist-sized tumor in his esophagus that has spread to his lymph nodes. Schuller's oncologists said the tumor was either at or near stage 4 \u2014 the most serious cancer classification \u2014 but it has yet to reach his vital organs and he has been strong enough for treatment. Milner said her father \"doesn't have a lot of energy\" but has been \"very reflective, very peaceful and truly beautiful.\" \"He's closer to heaven than he is to this tangible world,\" Milner said. Another daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman, first revealed news that Schuller was undergoing treatment in an Aug. 25 sermon at her new church, the Hope Center of Christ. The elder Schuller decided to pursue the treatment after praying with his wife, Arvella, and other family members, Schuller Coleman said. Doctors said the televangelist had three months to live, but then said he could live for two years with radiation and chemotherapy. Schuller began preaching in 1955 from the top of a drive-in movie theater concession stand in Orange County and by 1970 had launched a TV ministry with the \"Hour of Power.\" He built the landmark cathedral in 1980. At its peak, the broadcast attracted 20 million viewers around the world but in recent years, Schuller's ministry was hamstrung by a disastrous leadership transition and a decline in viewership and donations. The once-popular televangelist resigned from the church's board in 2012, two years after the ministry filed for bankruptcy.

Schuller\n\nevidence: Televangelist Robert H. Schuller, who attempted to integrate the teachings of John Calvin with the positive thinking of Norman Vincent Peale, and lost his famed Crystal Cathedral to bankruptcy, died Thursday at age 88, according to the Hour of Power ministry he started. He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the summer of 2013. After becoming one of the nation's best-known pastors, Schuller watched his megachurch empire \u2014 that started in a drive-in theater \u2014 crumble amid huge debt and family squabbles over leadership. In 2011, a bankruptcy proceeding reached a $57.5 million deal to permit the Catholic Diocese of Orange to purchase the iconic glass sanctuary in Garden Grove, Calif. The remaining Protestant congregation, Shepherd's Grove, moved to a Roman Catholic church building with half the seating capacity of its former home, led by Schuller's grandson, Bobby Schuller. \"I have the incredible honor of carrying on my grandfather's legacy by teaching people that they are not what they do, not what they have, and not what people say about them. They are the beloved of God,\" Bobby Schuller said in a statement. In 2012, Robert H. and Arvella Schuller resigned from the ministry they began more than 50 years before, citing differences with its board. Their only son Robert A. Schuller, onetime heir apparent, served as senior pastor for two years, resigning in 2008 after disputes about the ministry's direction. Sheila Schuller Coleman, their oldest daughter, took on the pastoral role but left in 2012 and started a church nearby. Despite the \"tragedy\" of family dissension that marked the end of Schuller's career, evangelical scholar Richard Mouw said he was \"one of the great church leaders in the 20th century. \"The very idea of the original congregation in Anaheim, of a drive-in church, was very innovative,\" said Mouw, the former president of Fuller Theological Seminary. \"It was, I think, motivated in great part by a desire to reach people who ordinarily would not come to a church.\" But as other large church leaders took megachurch ministries and religious broadcasting in new directions, Schuller had a devotion to the Protestant tradition and maintained the \"dignity of worship,\" Mouw said, wearing a clerical robe on international television and having a renowned choir and \"one of the finest organs in the world.\" The author of more than 30 books, including five New York Times best-sellers, Robert Schuller was best known for his four decades of televised Sunday services, Hour of Power. From his soaring Crystal Cathedral, Schuller's program was broadcast in five languages and 50 nations, with a worldwide audience of 20 million per week. Along the way, his popularity in America surpassed the likes of Oral Roberts and Pat Robertson. It was a distinction that Schuller wore well. Earlier in his career, he had emerged largely unscathed from the \"earthquake,\" as he called it \u2014 the Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart scandals of the late 1980s that had rocked the world of televangelism. Schuller was also one of the most touted leaders of the Reformed Church in America, which sometimes identified itself as \"the denomination of Norman Vincent Peale and Robert Schuller.\" But like Peale, Schuller had his share of critics. Some Christians were scornful of his celebration of \"possibility thinking,\" and attacked his \"theology of self-esteem,\" saying that it muted biblical warnings of sin and evil through a blend of gospel and psychology. That combination, they said, treated morality as merely a relative code of values. Schuller dismissed the charges. \"I don't think anything has been done in the name of Christ and under the banner of Christianity that has proven more destructive to human personality and, hence, counterproductive to the evangelism enterprise than the often crude, uncouth, and un-Christian strategy of attempting to make people aware of their lost and sinful condition,\" Schuller told Christianity Today. This view surfaced notably in 1998, when \u2014 at the height of then-President Clinton's sex scandal \u2014 Schuller tempered criticism of Clinton by saying \"we all share part of the shame.\" He argued that the nation's stubbornly high approval ratings of Clinton had enabled the president to avoid confronting his behavior. The year before, Schuller had been thanked by Clinton in a State of the Union address, in which Clinton credited the evangelist with advising him to read Isaiah for strength in leading America. Born in 1926, Schuller was reared in a religious Iowan family of Dutch descent. He later said he knew he wanted to be a minister. As part of his seminary studies, he wrote an index of Calvin's four-volume Institutes of the Christian Religion. In 1950, after receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree from Hope College and a Master of Divinity from Western Theological Seminary, he was ordained by the Re\n\nquestion: When did Reverend Robert H.

He soon entered the pastorate at one of the denomination's churches in Chicago, which over the next five years grew from 38 to 400 members. Then in 1955, he was sent to Orange County, Calif., to establish a church. After trying unsuccessfully to rent a facility, Schuller \u2014 with his wife Arvella as organist and $500 in assets \u2014 finally settled on a drive-in theater where he held Sunday services from a snack bar's roof. While attracting worshippers, Schuller gravitated toward the teachings of Peale, pastor of New York's Marble Collegiate Church, whom he credited with fine-tuning his faith and laying the foundation for the \"possibility thinking\" that was to come. His congregation grew steadily. By the 1970s, Schuller was a widely televised preacher whose Garden Grove Community Church in Orange County became a pioneering megachurch, and in the years ahead, he solicited New York architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee to design a modern cathedral. The result, a huge sanctuary with thousands of windows of reflective glass became known as the Crystal Cathedral and opened in 1980. With the exception of Disneyland, the church \u2014 which eventually drew more than 10,000 members \u2014 became the most famous architectural work in Orange County. In the late 1980s, reports of both Bakker's and Swaggart's misdeeds caused greater media scrutiny of televangelists \u2014 and their finances. Schuller was among them. A former employee accused him of deceiving followers in a fundraising letter. Then, in 1988, Schuller announced that his church was facing money shortages stemming from the \"shock waves\" echoing through American evangelism. \"That's what happens when you become high-profile.\" Still, by decade's end, the public esteem of Schuller, along with Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell, was far less affected than that of Bakker and Swaggart. In 1997, Schuller was again publicly shamed when an airline flight attendant sued Schuller and his church for more than $2.5 million for what he claimed were injuries sustained during a flight between Los Angeles and New York. The flight attendant said Schuller grabbed his shoulder and repeatedly shook him, causing physical and psychological damage. Schuller denied trying to hurt the man, but said he was only trying to get his attention. \"My actions were inappropriate, considering the circumstances, and wherever he might be I want him to know that I apologize for any portion of my conduct which he found offensive. \u2026 I am 70 years old, but I am not too old to learn or be taught new lessons.\" In the years ahead, Schuller's congregation still grew, with a $25 million structure built on the Crystal Cathedral complex in 1989. Celebrities and politicians \u2014 from Maya Angelou to Mikhail Gorbachev \u2014 visited Schuller's church. In 2003, Schuller opened a new visitors' center, the International Center for Possibility Thinking. Thousands of individuals were shaped by his message over the years, said Mouw, now a professor of faith and public life at Fuller, who mocked Schuller's \"possibility thinking\" when he first arrived at the seminary in the mid-1980s until several students asked him to stop. \"'That's how we became Christians,'\" the students told him. \"That's why we are in seminary because we were really touched by his ministry.' \u2026 These are people who have gone on to very solid ministries but they credit their initial sense of God's very personal presence in their life and their call for ministry to the influence of Robert Schuller.\" The Rev. Wes Granberg-Michaelson, general secretary emeritus of the Reformed Church in America, said Schuller was the most widely known minister of his denomination. \"As international television broadcasting opened up new markets, the 'Hour of Power' was often there, and watched by those \u2014 including church leaders, kings, generals, and prime ministers \u2014 who now had access to satellite TV,\" he said. \"While his actual ministry eventually crumbled in tragedy, the Cathedral \u2014 now Christ Cathedral \u2014 still stands, and is a testimony to Schuller's imaginative vision.\" After dealing with bankruptcy and his resignation, Schuller made occasional appearances at his daughter's church. When Schuller read Scripture at Coleman's church on Easter Sunday 2013, she recalled how he trained her as the family read the Bible around the table after dinner. \"More often than not, I'd just get started reading and Dad would say, 'Stop. Do it again, Sheila. This time with feeling,'\" she said, imitating her father's deep voice. \"So you can blame him if you think my messages have too much feeling.\" That Easter, he read from 1 Corinthians: \"Oh death, where is your sting? Oh Hades, where is your victory? Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Schuller is survived by five children and more than\n\nquestion: When did Reverend Robert H.

Schuller\n\nevidence: Robert Harold Schuller (September 16, 1926 \u2013 April 2, 2015) was an American Christian televangelist, pastor, motivational speaker, and author. In his five decades of television, Schuller was principally known for the weekly Hour of Power television program, which he began hosting in 1970 until his retirement in 2006. His grandson, Bobby Schuller, carries on the Hour of Power now airing for over fifty years. During his time as a minister, Schuller oversaw the construction of two churches in Garden Grove, CA. The first church built under his tenure was the Garden Grove Community Church chapel, which seated 500, and the second that he oversaw was the building of the much larger Crystal Cathedral, which has a seating capacity of 2,200. Schuller began broadcasting his Hour of Power program from the smaller Garden Grove chapel in 1969. He made the decision to begin his broadcast of Hour of Power shortly after he had received encouragement from longtime friend Billy Graham during a visit with the popular evangelist. The Hour of Power broadcast later continued in the Crystal Cathedral. Like his good friend Billy Graham, the Schuller organization never became closely associated with any major scandal. During the 90's his televised sermons were regularly viewed by an estimated audience of 20 million. Schuller's weekly telecast of his sermons which began in 1969 was one of the first instances of such weekly televised church services, and was the world's most widely watched hour-long church service ever. Robert Harold Schuller was born on September 16, 1926, near Alton, Iowa, the second son of Jennie (n\u00e9e Beltman; 1891\u20131970) and Anthony Schuller (1882\u20131964). He was the youngest of five children. All of his grandparents were Dutch immigrants, and he was raised on his parents' farm nearby in a small, close-knit community of Dutch-Americans, without running water. In 1927 on the day of his baptism at his family\u2019s Reformed Church in Newkirk, Iowa, the six month old Schuller was clothed in a certain \"baptismal-gown.\u201d Years later Schuller announced that he had kept his baptismal-gown and placed it on display in his office, referring to it as his most-prized-possession. To Schuller apparently the gown had represented the day that his life had first been dedicated to God. In his later years Schuller placed an inscription beneath the gown reading: \"This is the reason my life has been a success. As a child I was dedicated to our Lord.\" In 1931, just weeks before his fifth birthday a visiting uncle who was a minister had predicted that the young boy was destined to spread the word of God to many when he grew up. Schuller called the moment that he had first heard his uncle's prediction the \"single most defining moment of my early life.\" After graduating from Newkirk High School in Newkirk, Iowa, in 1944, Schuller continued his education at Hope College, located in Holland, Michigan. In 1950, now studying at Western Theological Seminary, Schuller received his Master of Divinity degree. The seminary teaches in the theological tradition and practice of John Calvin. He was soon ordained as a minister in the Reformed Church in America. After his ordination, he first worked at Ivanhoe Reformed Church in Riverdale, Illinois, before moving to Garden Grove, California. In Garden Grove, California in 1955 Schuller opened what would be his first church in the area, which he called the \u201cGarden Grove Community Church.\u201d At the time, Schuller was trying out a relatively new concept in \u201cchurch service presentation\u201d known as the \u201cDrive-in Church Model.\u201c His new church was located in the old Orange Drive-in Movie Theater where churchgoers could enjoy their church services from the comfort of their own cars. For the benefit of those who preferred more traditional church services, he later also rented a 300-seat former Baptist church, about four miles (6 km) down the road from his new drive-in theater church. On Sunday mornings Schuller would first preside at a 9:30 service in the Baptist chapel and then he would deliver his organ to the roof of the concession stand at the old drive-in theater where he would then preside over his second Sunday service. As the size of the congregations grew, Schuller purchased 10 acres (4.0 ha) of land at 12141 Lewis Street in Garden Grove for a \"walk-in, drive-in\" church, serving both congregations. Ground was broken September 10, 1958 for construction of Schuller's second church-home in the area, which was designed by international architect Richard Neutra. This second church was completed in 1961, at a cost of $3 million (equivalent to $29 million in 2022). The dedication service was held November 5, 1961. The design\n\nquestion: Who was diagnosed with esophageal cancer?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Robert Schuller was diagnosed with esophageal cancer.", "usage": 1148}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Schuller\n\nevidence:  of the new church building enabled Schuller to preach his sermons to worshipers in 500 cars, as well as to members of the congregation inside the church. Schuller's second area church was built on what was to later become a part of the campus of his future (and much larger) \"Crystal Cathedral Church.\" Seven years later in 1968 a \"Tower of Hope\" steeple structure was added onto the north side of the property. The Tower of Hope structure rose 13 stories (approximately 130 to 150 feet (40 to 46 m) into the air and was the tallest structure in Orange County at that time. The steeple structure was then topped by an illuminated cross which added another 90 feet (27 m) to the structure's overall height. Also in 1968, Schuller purchased a 10-acre (4.0 ha) walnut grove that had bordered on the north boundary of the then current Garden Grove Community Church property. This new purchase of land was to enable the construction of a future much larger Crystal Cathedral on the newly expanded property. The architectural firm of Philip Johnson/John Burgee was soon retained to draw up plans for a primarily glass church that would be able to accommodate over 2,000 church goers, which was to be built on a spot on the newly expanded church campus adjacent to the original church structure. In order to meet the needs of the church's ever expanding congregation, the architectural firm designed a reflective glass building that could seat 2,248 people. At the time that it was built, the church was touted as \"the largest glass building in the world.\" The church was dedicated on September 14, 1980. Once the newer, larger, and more noticeable \"Crystal Cathedral\" structure was completed, Schuller renamed his organization as the \"Crystal Cathedral Ministries.\" Schuller's Crystal Cathedral Church soon became the iconic backdrop from which he preached his popular Hour of Power broadcasts every Sunday morning for the next 25 years. These broadcasts regularly reached a world wide audience of 20 million. Schuller emphasized what he believed are the positive aspects of the Christian faith. He deliberately avoided condemning people for sin, believing that Jesus \"met needs before touting creeds\". Once in a relationship with God, Schuller emphasized, someone who is sowing positive faith in his heart and actions will discover that the by-product is a reduction of sin. He was known to say, \"Sin is a condition before it is an action.\" Schuller encouraged Christians and non-Christians to achieve great things through God and to believe in their dreams. He wrote, \"If you can dream it, you can do it!\" As the Crystal Cathedral's founding pastor, Schuller was seen and heard internationally on Sundays on the world's most widely watched hour-long church service, the Hour of Power, 1,500 of which were recorded. On June 15, 1950, Schuller married Arvella De Haan (1929\u20132014), a church organist, who became instrumental in developing the music department at the Crystal Cathedral and was the creator and producer of the Hour of Power for over 40 years. The Schullers had five children: Sheila, Tim, Robert, Jeanne, Carol, and Gretchen. On January 22, 2006, Schuller's son, Robert A. Schuller, assumed the role of senior pastor of the Crystal Cathedral. On October 25, 2008, however, he resigned. His father cited \"a lack of shared vision\" as the cause. Schuller stated that \"different ideas as to the direction and the vision for this ministry\" with his son \"made it necessary... to part ways in the Hour of Power television ministry\". Schuller also said \"I love my son and am proud of my son\" and that the long-term survival of his ministry was dependent on expanding its imprint beyond the Schuller name. \"The real minister's name that we honor is Jesus, not Schuller\", he said. The ministry then opened the pulpit to a variety of notable Christian speakers. On June 11, 2009, Schuller announced that the church's leadership would pass to his eldest daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman. On July 11, 2010, he announced that he was retiring as principal pastor of the Crystal Cathedral and would become chairman of the church's board of directors. After a year as interim senior pastor, Sheila Schuller Coleman was elevated to senior pastor in July 2010. In the wake of Robert Schuller's retirement and after much sorting out, in 2013 Robert H. Schuller's grandson, Bobby V. Schuller moved the remaining congregation from the Crystal Cathedral building and eventually into the somewhat smaller Shepherd's Grove church building in nearby Irvine, CA. Along the way, from 2013 through 2018 the congregation also temporarily leased what had formerly been the St. Callistus Catholic church of Garden Grove for their Sunday services. During these years Schuller's grandson took over the leadership of the remaining congregation and also resumed the broadcast of his grandfather's Hour\n\nquestion: Who was diagnosed with esophageal cancer?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1153}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The Crystal Cathedral building and its campus was then sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange for use as its diocesan cathedral and offices. Subsequently, the Diocese of Orange renamed the building as the Christ Cathedral. On October 18, 2010, Coleman announced that the Crystal Cathedral was seeking bankruptcy protection, in the midst of what became known as the Great Recession. In May 2011, the senior Schullers, along with their daughter Carol and her husband Tim, were dismissed from the ministry at the Crystal Cathedral. They filed for bankruptcy. The court would eventually allow them approximately 20 percent of what they were owed. The creditors would be paid in full plus interest. In July 2011, it was reported in the Orange County Register that Schuller had been ousted from the Crystal Cathedral board. In July 2011, Coleman attempted to reverse the decision that had been made in her absence, saying, \"Dad will continue to provide leadership for this ministry through me for as long as possible\" and, \"I have and will continue to defer to his wisdom and honor him for his unprecedented accomplishments.\" On March 11, 2012, after months of attempting to change the attitude of the ministry's board, Coleman told the Crystal Cathedral congregation that she was leaving to start a new church because of \"a hostile work environment\". The International Business Times reported that this came following \"a bitter fallout between the ministry and its founding family\". According to the Religion News Service, the founders were left with little to no assets; their home was fully mortgaged. On January 24, 2013, the Crystal Cathedral's board of directors voted to make Bobby Schuller, Schuller's grandson (son of Robert Anthony Schuller), the new pastor for the Hour of Power television program as well as a non-voting member of the board. In late August 2013, Robert H. Schuller was diagnosed with esophageal cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes. A follow-up examination in September 2013 presented Schuller with the possibility of undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy that could extend his life. Schuller then agreed to receive the cancer treatments, which may have been responsible for extending his life by nearly two more years as had been predicted by his physicians. Arvella Schuller died on February 11, 2014, aged 84. The Schullers had been married for 63 years. Schuller died peacefully, early on the morning of April 2, 2015 at a nursing facility in Artesia, California, aged 88. His funeral was held at Christ Cathedral, the former campus of the Crystal Cathedral. He is interred next to his wife at the Christ Cathedral Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Garden Grove, California. Schuller authored over 30 hardcover books, 6 of which made The New York Times and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists, including:\n\nquestion: Who was diagnosed with esophageal cancer?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Robert H.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Crystal Cathedral founder and former televangelist the Rev. Robert H. Schuller has been diagnosed with cancer, his daughter said Thursday. Carol Schuller Milner told The Associated Press that Schuller, 86, has a fist-sized tumor in his esophagus that has spread to his lymph nodes. Schuller's oncologists said the tumor was either at or near stage 4 \u2014 the most serious cancer classification \u2014 but it has yet to reach his vital organs and he has been strong enough for treatment. Milner said her father \"doesn't have a lot of energy\" but has been \"very reflective, very peaceful and truly beautiful.\" \"He's closer to heaven than he is to this tangible world,\" Milner said. Another daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman, first revealed news that Schuller was undergoing treatment in an Aug. 25 sermon at her new church, the Hope Center of Christ. The elder Schuller decided to pursue the treatment after praying with his wife, Arvella, and other family members, Schuller Coleman said. Doctors said the televangelist had three months to live, but then said he could live for two years with radiation and chemotherapy. Schuller began preaching in 1955 from the top of a drive-in movie theater concession stand in Orange County and by 1970 had launched a TV ministry with the \"Hour of Power.\" He built the landmark cathedral in 1980. At its peak, the broadcast attracted 20 million viewers around the world but in recent years, Schuller's ministry was hamstrung by a disastrous leadership transition and a decline in viewership and donations. The once-popular televangelist resigned from the church's board in 2012, two years after the ministry filed for bankruptcy. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange bought the cathedral in bankruptcy proceedings and renamed the building Christ Cathedral.

Schuller, who attempted to integrate the teachings of John Calvin with the positive thinking of Norman Vincent Peale, and lost his famed Crystal Cathedral to bankruptcy, died Thursday at age 88, according to the Hour of Power ministry he started. He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the summer of 2013. After becoming one of the nation's best-known pastors, Schuller watched his megachurch empire \u2014 that started in a drive-in theater \u2014 crumble amid huge debt and family squabbles over leadership. In 2011, a bankruptcy proceeding reached a $57.5 million deal to permit the Catholic Diocese of Orange to purchase the iconic glass sanctuary in Garden Grove, Calif. The remaining Protestant congregation, Shepherd's Grove, moved to a Roman Catholic church building with half the seating capacity of its former home, led by Schuller's grandson, Bobby Schuller. \"I have the incredible honor of carrying on my grandfather's legacy by teaching people that they are not what they do, not what they have, and not what people say about them. They are the beloved of God,\" Bobby Schuller said in a statement. In 2012, Robert H. and Arvella Schuller resigned from the ministry they began more than 50 years before, citing differences with its board. Their only son Robert A. Schuller, onetime heir apparent, served as senior pastor for two years, resigning in 2008 after disputes about the ministry's direction. Sheila Schuller Coleman, their oldest daughter, took on the pastoral role but left in 2012 and started a church nearby. Despite the \"tragedy\" of family dissension that marked the end of Schuller's career, evangelical scholar Richard Mouw said he was \"one of the great church leaders in the 20th century. \"The very idea of the original congregation in Anaheim, of a drive-in church, was very innovative,\" said Mouw, the former president of Fuller Theological Seminary. \"It was, I think, motivated in great part by a desire to reach people who ordinarily would not come to a church.\" But as other large church leaders took megachurch ministries and religious broadcasting in new directions, Schuller had a devotion to the Protestant tradition and maintained the \"dignity of worship,\" Mouw said, wearing a clerical robe on international television and having a renowned choir and \"one of the finest organs in the world.\" The author of more than 30 books, including five New York Times best-sellers, Robert Schuller was best known for his four decades of televised Sunday services, Hour of Power. From his soaring Crystal Cathedral, Schuller's program was broadcast in five languages and 50 nations, with a worldwide audience of 20 million per week. Along the way, his popularity in America surpassed the likes of Oral Roberts and Pat Robertson. It was a distinction that Schuller wore well. Earlier in his career, he had emerged largely unscathed from the \"earthquake,\" as he called it \u2014 the Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart scandals of the late 1980s that had rocked the world of televangelism. Schuller was also one of the most touted leaders of the Reformed Church in America, which sometimes identified itself as \"the denomination of Norman Vincent Peale and Robert Schuller.\" But like Peale, Schuller had his share of critics. Some Christians were scornful of his celebration of \"possibility thinking,\" and attacked his \"theology of self-esteem,\" saying that it muted biblical warnings of sin and evil through a blend of gospel and psychology. That combination, they said, treated morality as merely a relative code of values. Schuller dismissed the charges. \"I don't think anything has been done in the name of Christ and under the banner of Christianity that has proven more destructive to human personality and, hence, counterproductive to the evangelism enterprise than the often crude, uncouth, and un-Christian strategy of attempting to make people aware of their lost and sinful condition,\" Schuller told Christianity Today. This view surfaced notably in 1998, when \u2014 at the height of then-President Clinton's sex scandal \u2014 Schuller tempered criticism of Clinton by saying \"we all share part of the shame.\" He argued that the nation's stubbornly high approval ratings of Clinton had enabled the president to avoid confronting his behavior. The year before, Schuller had been thanked by Clinton in a State of the Union address, in which Clinton credited the evangelist with advising him to read Isaiah for strength in leading America. Born in 1926, Schuller was reared in a religious Iowan family of Dutch descent. He later said he knew he wanted to be a minister. As part of his seminary studies, he wrote an index of Calvin's four-volume Institutes of the Christian Religion. In 1950, after receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree from Hope College and a Master of Divinity from Western Theological Seminary, he was ordained by the Re\n\nquestion: Who was diagnosed with esophageal cancer?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Robert H.

He soon entered the pastorate at one of the denomination's churches in Chicago, which over the next five years grew from 38 to 400 members. Then in 1955, he was sent to Orange County, Calif., to establish a church. After trying unsuccessfully to rent a facility, Schuller \u2014 with his wife Arvella as organist and $500 in assets \u2014 finally settled on a drive-in theater where he held Sunday services from a snack bar's roof. While attracting worshippers, Schuller gravitated toward the teachings of Peale, pastor of New York's Marble Collegiate Church, whom he credited with fine-tuning his faith and laying the foundation for the \"possibility thinking\" that was to come. His congregation grew steadily. By the 1970s, Schuller was a widely televised preacher whose Garden Grove Community Church in Orange County became a pioneering megachurch, and in the years ahead, he solicited New York architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee to design a modern cathedral. The result, a huge sanctuary with thousands of windows of reflective glass became known as the Crystal Cathedral and opened in 1980. With the exception of Disneyland, the church \u2014 which eventually drew more than 10,000 members \u2014 became the most famous architectural work in Orange County. In the late 1980s, reports of both Bakker's and Swaggart's misdeeds caused greater media scrutiny of televangelists \u2014 and their finances. Schuller was among them. A former employee accused him of deceiving followers in a fundraising letter. Then, in 1988, Schuller announced that his church was facing money shortages stemming from the \"shock waves\" echoing through American evangelism. \"That's what happens when you become high-profile.\" Still, by decade's end, the public esteem of Schuller, along with Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell, was far less affected than that of Bakker and Swaggart. In 1997, Schuller was again publicly shamed when an airline flight attendant sued Schuller and his church for more than $2.5 million for what he claimed were injuries sustained during a flight between Los Angeles and New York. The flight attendant said Schuller grabbed his shoulder and repeatedly shook him, causing physical and psychological damage. Schuller denied trying to hurt the man, but said he was only trying to get his attention. \"My actions were inappropriate, considering the circumstances, and wherever he might be I want him to know that I apologize for any portion of my conduct which he found offensive. \u2026 I am 70 years old, but I am not too old to learn or be taught new lessons.\" In the years ahead, Schuller's congregation still grew, with a $25 million structure built on the Crystal Cathedral complex in 1989. Celebrities and politicians \u2014 from Maya Angelou to Mikhail Gorbachev \u2014 visited Schuller's church. In 2003, Schuller opened a new visitors' center, the International Center for Possibility Thinking. Thousands of individuals were shaped by his message over the years, said Mouw, now a professor of faith and public life at Fuller, who mocked Schuller's \"possibility thinking\" when he first arrived at the seminary in the mid-1980s until several students asked him to stop. \"'That's how we became Christians,'\" the students told him. \"That's why we are in seminary because we were really touched by his ministry.' \u2026 These are people who have gone on to very solid ministries but they credit their initial sense of God's very personal presence in their life and their call for ministry to the influence of Robert Schuller.\" The Rev. Wes Granberg-Michaelson, general secretary emeritus of the Reformed Church in America, said Schuller was the most widely known minister of his denomination. \"As international television broadcasting opened up new markets, the 'Hour of Power' was often there, and watched by those \u2014 including church leaders, kings, generals, and prime ministers \u2014 who now had access to satellite TV,\" he said. \"While his actual ministry eventually crumbled in tragedy, the Cathedral \u2014 now Christ Cathedral \u2014 still stands, and is a testimony to Schuller's imaginative vision.\" After dealing with bankruptcy and his resignation, Schuller made occasional appearances at his daughter's church. When Schuller read Scripture at Coleman's church on Easter Sunday 2013, she recalled how he trained her as the family read the Bible around the table after dinner. \"More often than not, I'd just get started reading and Dad would say, 'Stop. Do it again, Sheila. This time with feeling,'\" she said, imitating her father's deep voice. \"So you can blame him if you think my messages have too much feeling.\" That Easter, he read from 1 Corinthians: \"Oh death, where is your sting? Oh Hades, where is your victory? Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Schuller is survived by five children and more than\n\nquestion: Who was diagnosed with esophageal cancer?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1136}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Schuller\n\nevidence: Robert Harold Schuller (September 16, 1926 \u2013 April 2, 2015) was an American Christian televangelist, pastor, motivational speaker, and author. In his five decades of television, Schuller was principally known for the weekly Hour of Power television program, which he began hosting in 1970 until his retirement in 2006. His grandson, Bobby Schuller, carries on the Hour of Power now airing for over fifty years. During his time as a minister, Schuller oversaw the construction of two churches in Garden Grove, CA. The first church built under his tenure was the Garden Grove Community Church chapel, which seated 500, and the second that he oversaw was the building of the much larger Crystal Cathedral, which has a seating capacity of 2,200. Schuller began broadcasting his Hour of Power program from the smaller Garden Grove chapel in 1969. He made the decision to begin his broadcast of Hour of Power shortly after he had received encouragement from longtime friend Billy Graham during a visit with the popular evangelist. The Hour of Power broadcast later continued in the Crystal Cathedral. Like his good friend Billy Graham, the Schuller organization never became closely associated with any major scandal. During the 90's his televised sermons were regularly viewed by an estimated audience of 20 million. Schuller's weekly telecast of his sermons which began in 1969 was one of the first instances of such weekly televised church services, and was the world's most widely watched hour-long church service ever. Robert Harold Schuller was born on September 16, 1926, near Alton, Iowa, the second son of Jennie (n\u00e9e Beltman; 1891\u20131970) and Anthony Schuller (1882\u20131964). He was the youngest of five children. All of his grandparents were Dutch immigrants, and he was raised on his parents' farm nearby in a small, close-knit community of Dutch-Americans, without running water. In 1927 on the day of his baptism at his family\u2019s Reformed Church in Newkirk, Iowa, the six month old Schuller was clothed in a certain \"baptismal-gown.\u201d Years later Schuller announced that he had kept his baptismal-gown and placed it on display in his office, referring to it as his most-prized-possession. To Schuller apparently the gown had represented the day that his life had first been dedicated to God. In his later years Schuller placed an inscription beneath the gown reading: \"This is the reason my life has been a success. As a child I was dedicated to our Lord.\" In 1931, just weeks before his fifth birthday a visiting uncle who was a minister had predicted that the young boy was destined to spread the word of God to many when he grew up. Schuller called the moment that he had first heard his uncle's prediction the \"single most defining moment of my early life.\" After graduating from Newkirk High School in Newkirk, Iowa, in 1944, Schuller continued his education at Hope College, located in Holland, Michigan. In 1950, now studying at Western Theological Seminary, Schuller received his Master of Divinity degree. The seminary teaches in the theological tradition and practice of John Calvin. He was soon ordained as a minister in the Reformed Church in America. After his ordination, he first worked at Ivanhoe Reformed Church in Riverdale, Illinois, before moving to Garden Grove, California. In Garden Grove, California in 1955 Schuller opened what would be his first church in the area, which he called the \u201cGarden Grove Community Church.\u201d At the time, Schuller was trying out a relatively new concept in \u201cchurch service presentation\u201d known as the \u201cDrive-in Church Model.\u201c His new church was located in the old Orange Drive-in Movie Theater where churchgoers could enjoy their church services from the comfort of their own cars. For the benefit of those who preferred more traditional church services, he later also rented a 300-seat former Baptist church, about four miles (6 km) down the road from his new drive-in theater church. On Sunday mornings Schuller would first preside at a 9:30 service in the Baptist chapel and then he would deliver his organ to the roof of the concession stand at the old drive-in theater where he would then preside over his second Sunday service. As the size of the congregations grew, Schuller purchased 10 acres (4.0 ha) of land at 12141 Lewis Street in Garden Grove for a \"walk-in, drive-in\" church, serving both congregations. Ground was broken September 10, 1958 for construction of Schuller's second church-home in the area, which was designed by international architect Richard Neutra. This second church was completed in 1961, at a cost of $3 million (equivalent to $29 million in 2022). The dedication service was held November 5, 1961. The design\n\nquestion: What was the Reverend Robert H.

Schuller\n\nevidence:  of the new church building enabled Schuller to preach his sermons to worshipers in 500 cars, as well as to members of the congregation inside the church. Schuller's second area church was built on what was to later become a part of the campus of his future (and much larger) \"Crystal Cathedral Church.\" Seven years later in 1968 a \"Tower of Hope\" steeple structure was added onto the north side of the property. The Tower of Hope structure rose 13 stories (approximately 130 to 150 feet (40 to 46 m) into the air and was the tallest structure in Orange County at that time. The steeple structure was then topped by an illuminated cross which added another 90 feet (27 m) to the structure's overall height. Also in 1968, Schuller purchased a 10-acre (4.0 ha) walnut grove that had bordered on the north boundary of the then current Garden Grove Community Church property. This new purchase of land was to enable the construction of a future much larger Crystal Cathedral on the newly expanded property. The architectural firm of Philip Johnson/John Burgee was soon retained to draw up plans for a primarily glass church that would be able to accommodate over 2,000 church goers, which was to be built on a spot on the newly expanded church campus adjacent to the original church structure. In order to meet the needs of the church's ever expanding congregation, the architectural firm designed a reflective glass building that could seat 2,248 people. At the time that it was built, the church was touted as \"the largest glass building in the world.\" The church was dedicated on September 14, 1980. Once the newer, larger, and more noticeable \"Crystal Cathedral\" structure was completed, Schuller renamed his organization as the \"Crystal Cathedral Ministries.\" Schuller's Crystal Cathedral Church soon became the iconic backdrop from which he preached his popular Hour of Power broadcasts every Sunday morning for the next 25 years. These broadcasts regularly reached a world wide audience of 20 million. Schuller emphasized what he believed are the positive aspects of the Christian faith. He deliberately avoided condemning people for sin, believing that Jesus \"met needs before touting creeds\". Once in a relationship with God, Schuller emphasized, someone who is sowing positive faith in his heart and actions will discover that the by-product is a reduction of sin. He was known to say, \"Sin is a condition before it is an action.\" Schuller encouraged Christians and non-Christians to achieve great things through God and to believe in their dreams. He wrote, \"If you can dream it, you can do it!\" As the Crystal Cathedral's founding pastor, Schuller was seen and heard internationally on Sundays on the world's most widely watched hour-long church service, the Hour of Power, 1,500 of which were recorded. On June 15, 1950, Schuller married Arvella De Haan (1929\u20132014), a church organist, who became instrumental in developing the music department at the Crystal Cathedral and was the creator and producer of the Hour of Power for over 40 years. The Schullers had five children: Sheila, Tim, Robert, Jeanne, Carol, and Gretchen. On January 22, 2006, Schuller's son, Robert A. Schuller, assumed the role of senior pastor of the Crystal Cathedral. On October 25, 2008, however, he resigned. His father cited \"a lack of shared vision\" as the cause. Schuller stated that \"different ideas as to the direction and the vision for this ministry\" with his son \"made it necessary... to part ways in the Hour of Power television ministry\". Schuller also said \"I love my son and am proud of my son\" and that the long-term survival of his ministry was dependent on expanding its imprint beyond the Schuller name. \"The real minister's name that we honor is Jesus, not Schuller\", he said. The ministry then opened the pulpit to a variety of notable Christian speakers. On June 11, 2009, Schuller announced that the church's leadership would pass to his eldest daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman. On July 11, 2010, he announced that he was retiring as principal pastor of the Crystal Cathedral and would become chairman of the church's board of directors. After a year as interim senior pastor, Sheila Schuller Coleman was elevated to senior pastor in July 2010. In the wake of Robert Schuller's retirement and after much sorting out, in 2013 Robert H. Schuller's grandson, Bobby V. Schuller moved the remaining congregation from the Crystal Cathedral building and eventually into the somewhat smaller Shepherd's Grove church building in nearby Irvine, CA. Along the way, from 2013 through 2018 the congregation also temporarily leased what had formerly been the St. Callistus Catholic church of Garden Grove for their Sunday services. During these years Schuller's grandson took over the leadership of the remaining congregation and also resumed the broadcast of his grandfather's Hour\n\nquestion: What was the Reverend Robert H.

The Crystal Cathedral building and its campus was then sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange for use as its diocesan cathedral and offices. Subsequently, the Diocese of Orange renamed the building as the Christ Cathedral. On October 18, 2010, Coleman announced that the Crystal Cathedral was seeking bankruptcy protection, in the midst of what became known as the Great Recession. In May 2011, the senior Schullers, along with their daughter Carol and her husband Tim, were dismissed from the ministry at the Crystal Cathedral. They filed for bankruptcy. The court would eventually allow them approximately 20 percent of what they were owed. The creditors would be paid in full plus interest. In July 2011, it was reported in the Orange County Register that Schuller had been ousted from the Crystal Cathedral board. In July 2011, Coleman attempted to reverse the decision that had been made in her absence, saying, \"Dad will continue to provide leadership for this ministry through me for as long as possible\" and, \"I have and will continue to defer to his wisdom and honor him for his unprecedented accomplishments.\" On March 11, 2012, after months of attempting to change the attitude of the ministry's board, Coleman told the Crystal Cathedral congregation that she was leaving to start a new church because of \"a hostile work environment\". The International Business Times reported that this came following \"a bitter fallout between the ministry and its founding family\". According to the Religion News Service, the founders were left with little to no assets; their home was fully mortgaged. On January 24, 2013, the Crystal Cathedral's board of directors voted to make Bobby Schuller, Schuller's grandson (son of Robert Anthony Schuller), the new pastor for the Hour of Power television program as well as a non-voting member of the board. In late August 2013, Robert H. Schuller was diagnosed with esophageal cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes. A follow-up examination in September 2013 presented Schuller with the possibility of undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy that could extend his life. Schuller then agreed to receive the cancer treatments, which may have been responsible for extending his life by nearly two more years as had been predicted by his physicians. Arvella Schuller died on February 11, 2014, aged 84. The Schullers had been married for 63 years. Schuller died peacefully, early on the morning of April 2, 2015 at a nursing facility in Artesia, California, aged 88. His funeral was held at Christ Cathedral, the former campus of the Crystal Cathedral. He is interred next to his wife at the Christ Cathedral Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Garden Grove, California. Schuller authored over 30 hardcover books, 6 of which made The New York Times and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists, including:\n\nquestion: What was the Reverend Robert H.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Crystal Cathedral founder and former televangelist the Rev. Robert H. Schuller has been diagnosed with cancer, his daughter said Thursday. Carol Schuller Milner told The Associated Press that Schuller, 86, has a fist-sized tumor in his esophagus that has spread to his lymph nodes. Schuller's oncologists said the tumor was either at or near stage 4 \u2014 the most serious cancer classification \u2014 but it has yet to reach his vital organs and he has been strong enough for treatment. Milner said her father \"doesn't have a lot of energy\" but has been \"very reflective, very peaceful and truly beautiful.\" \"He's closer to heaven than he is to this tangible world,\" Milner said. Another daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman, first revealed news that Schuller was undergoing treatment in an Aug. 25 sermon at her new church, the Hope Center of Christ. The elder Schuller decided to pursue the treatment after praying with his wife, Arvella, and other family members, Schuller Coleman said. Doctors said the televangelist had three months to live, but then said he could live for two years with radiation and chemotherapy. Schuller began preaching in 1955 from the top of a drive-in movie theater concession stand in Orange County and by 1970 had launched a TV ministry with the \"Hour of Power.\" He built the landmark cathedral in 1980. At its peak, the broadcast attracted 20 million viewers around the world but in recent years, Schuller's ministry was hamstrung by a disastrous leadership transition and a decline in viewership and donations. The once-popular televangelist resigned from the church's board in 2012, two years after the ministry filed for bankruptcy. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange bought the cathedral in bankruptcy proceedings and renamed the building Christ Cathedral.

They are the beloved of God,\" Bobby Schuller said in a statement. In 2012, Robert H. and Arvella Schuller resigned from the ministry they began more than 50 years before, citing differences with its board. Their only son Robert A. Schuller, onetime heir apparent, served as senior pastor for two years, resigning in 2008 after disputes about the ministry's direction. Sheila Schuller Coleman, their oldest daughter, took on the pastoral role but left in 2012 and started a church nearby. Despite the \"tragedy\" of family dissension that marked the end of Schuller's career, evangelical scholar Richard Mouw said he was \"one of the great church leaders in the 20th century. \"The very idea of the original congregation in Anaheim, of a drive-in church, was very innovative,\" said Mouw, the former president of Fuller Theological Seminary. \"It was, I think, motivated in great part by a desire to reach people who ordinarily would not come to a church.\" But as other large church leaders took megachurch ministries and religious broadcasting in new directions, Schuller had a devotion to the Protestant tradition and maintained the \"dignity of worship,\" Mouw said, wearing a clerical robe on international television and having a renowned choir and \"one of the finest organs in the world.\" The author of more than 30 books, including five New York Times best-sellers, Robert Schuller was best known for his four decades of televised Sunday services, Hour of Power. From his soaring Crystal Cathedral, Schuller's program was broadcast in five languages and 50 nations, with a worldwide audience of 20 million per week. Along the way, his popularity in America surpassed the likes of Oral Roberts and Pat Robertson. It was a distinction that Schuller wore well. Earlier in his career, he had emerged largely unscathed from the \"earthquake,\" as he called it \u2014 the Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart scandals of the late 1980s that had rocked the world of televangelism. Schuller was also one of the most touted leaders of the Reformed Church in America, which sometimes identified itself as \"the denomination of Norman Vincent Peale and Robert Schuller.\" But like Peale, Schuller had his share of critics. Some Christians were scornful of his celebration of \"possibility thinking,\" and attacked his \"theology of self-esteem,\" saying that it muted biblical warnings of sin and evil through a blend of gospel and psychology. That combination, they said, treated morality as merely a relative code of values. Schuller dismissed the charges. \"I don't think anything has been done in the name of Christ and under the banner of Christianity that has proven more destructive to human personality and, hence, counterproductive to the evangelism enterprise than the often crude, uncouth, and un-Christian strategy of attempting to make people aware of their lost and sinful condition,\" Schuller told Christianity Today. This view surfaced notably in 1998, when \u2014 at the height of then-President Clinton's sex scandal \u2014 Schuller tempered criticism of Clinton by saying \"we all share part of the shame.\" He argued that the nation's stubbornly high approval ratings of Clinton had enabled the president to avoid confronting his behavior. The year before, Schuller had been thanked by Clinton in a State of the Union address, in which Clinton credited the evangelist with advising him to read Isaiah for strength in leading America. Born in 1926, Schuller was reared in a religious Iowan family of Dutch descent. He later said he knew he wanted to be a minister. As part of his seminary studies, he wrote an index of Calvin's four-volume Institutes of the Christian Religion. In 1950, after receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree from Hope College and a Master of Divinity from Western Theological Seminary, he was ordained by the Re\n\nquestion: What was the Reverend Robert H.

He soon entered the pastorate at one of the denomination's churches in Chicago, which over the next five years grew from 38 to 400 members. Then in 1955, he was sent to Orange County, Calif., to establish a church. After trying unsuccessfully to rent a facility, Schuller \u2014 with his wife Arvella as organist and $500 in assets \u2014 finally settled on a drive-in theater where he held Sunday services from a snack bar's roof. While attracting worshippers, Schuller gravitated toward the teachings of Peale, pastor of New York's Marble Collegiate Church, whom he credited with fine-tuning his faith and laying the foundation for the \"possibility thinking\" that was to come. His congregation grew steadily. By the 1970s, Schuller was a widely televised preacher whose Garden Grove Community Church in Orange County became a pioneering megachurch, and in the years ahead, he solicited New York architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee to design a modern cathedral. The result, a huge sanctuary with thousands of windows of reflective glass became known as the Crystal Cathedral and opened in 1980. With the exception of Disneyland, the church \u2014 which eventually drew more than 10,000 members \u2014 became the most famous architectural work in Orange County. In the late 1980s, reports of both Bakker's and Swaggart's misdeeds caused greater media scrutiny of televangelists \u2014 and their finances. Schuller was among them. A former employee accused him of deceiving followers in a fundraising letter. Then, in 1988, Schuller announced that his church was facing money shortages stemming from the \"shock waves\" echoing through American evangelism. \"That's what happens when you become high-profile.\" Still, by decade's end, the public esteem of Schuller, along with Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell, was far less affected than that of Bakker and Swaggart. In 1997, Schuller was again publicly shamed when an airline flight attendant sued Schuller and his church for more than $2.5 million for what he claimed were injuries sustained during a flight between Los Angeles and New York. The flight attendant said Schuller grabbed his shoulder and repeatedly shook him, causing physical and psychological damage. Schuller denied trying to hurt the man, but said he was only trying to get his attention. \"My actions were inappropriate, considering the circumstances, and wherever he might be I want him to know that I apologize for any portion of my conduct which he found offensive. \u2026 I am 70 years old, but I am not too old to learn or be taught new lessons.\" In the years ahead, Schuller's congregation still grew, with a $25 million structure built on the Crystal Cathedral complex in 1989. Celebrities and politicians \u2014 from Maya Angelou to Mikhail Gorbachev \u2014 visited Schuller's church. In 2003, Schuller opened a new visitors' center, the International Center for Possibility Thinking. Thousands of individuals were shaped by his message over the years, said Mouw, now a professor of faith and public life at Fuller, who mocked Schuller's \"possibility thinking\" when he first arrived at the seminary in the mid-1980s until several students asked him to stop. \"'That's how we became Christians,'\" the students told him. \"That's why we are in seminary because we were really touched by his ministry.' \u2026 These are people who have gone on to very solid ministries but they credit their initial sense of God's very personal presence in their life and their call for ministry to the influence of Robert Schuller.\" The Rev. Wes Granberg-Michaelson, general secretary emeritus of the Reformed Church in America, said Schuller was the most widely known minister of his denomination. \"As international television broadcasting opened up new markets, the 'Hour of Power' was often there, and watched by those \u2014 including church leaders, kings, generals, and prime ministers \u2014 who now had access to satellite TV,\" he said. \"While his actual ministry eventually crumbled in tragedy, the Cathedral \u2014 now Christ Cathedral \u2014 still stands, and is a testimony to Schuller's imaginative vision.\" After dealing with bankruptcy and his resignation, Schuller made occasional appearances at his daughter's church. When Schuller read Scripture at Coleman's church on Easter Sunday 2013, she recalled how he trained her as the family read the Bible around the table after dinner. \"More often than not, I'd just get started reading and Dad would say, 'Stop. Do it again, Sheila. This time with feeling,'\" she said, imitating her father's deep voice. \"So you can blame him if you think my messages have too much feeling.\" That Easter, he read from 1 Corinthians: \"Oh death, where is your sting? Oh Hades, where is your victory? Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Schuller is survived by five children and more than\n\nquestion: What was the Reverend Robert H.

Schuller\n\nevidence: Robert Harold Schuller (September 16, 1926 \u2013 April 2, 2015) was an American Christian televangelist, pastor, motivational speaker, and author. In his five decades of television, Schuller was principally known for the weekly Hour of Power television program, which he began hosting in 1970 until his retirement in 2006. His grandson, Bobby Schuller, carries on the Hour of Power now airing for over fifty years. During his time as a minister, Schuller oversaw the construction of two churches in Garden Grove, CA. The first church built under his tenure was the Garden Grove Community Church chapel, which seated 500, and the second that he oversaw was the building of the much larger Crystal Cathedral, which has a seating capacity of 2,200. Schuller began broadcasting his Hour of Power program from the smaller Garden Grove chapel in 1969. He made the decision to begin his broadcast of Hour of Power shortly after he had received encouragement from longtime friend Billy Graham during a visit with the popular evangelist. The Hour of Power broadcast later continued in the Crystal Cathedral. Like his good friend Billy Graham, the Schuller organization never became closely associated with any major scandal. During the 90's his televised sermons were regularly viewed by an estimated audience of 20 million. Schuller's weekly telecast of his sermons which began in 1969 was one of the first instances of such weekly televised church services, and was the world's most widely watched hour-long church service ever. Robert Harold Schuller was born on September 16, 1926, near Alton, Iowa, the second son of Jennie (n\u00e9e Beltman; 1891\u20131970) and Anthony Schuller (1882\u20131964). He was the youngest of five children. All of his grandparents were Dutch immigrants, and he was raised on his parents' farm nearby in a small, close-knit community of Dutch-Americans, without running water. In 1927 on the day of his baptism at his family\u2019s Reformed Church in Newkirk, Iowa, the six month old Schuller was clothed in a certain \"baptismal-gown.\u201d Years later Schuller announced that he had kept his baptismal-gown and placed it on display in his office, referring to it as his most-prized-possession. To Schuller apparently the gown had represented the day that his life had first been dedicated to God. In his later years Schuller placed an inscription beneath the gown reading: \"This is the reason my life has been a success. As a child I was dedicated to our Lord.\" In 1931, just weeks before his fifth birthday a visiting uncle who was a minister had predicted that the young boy was destined to spread the word of God to many when he grew up. Schuller called the moment that he had first heard his uncle's prediction the \"single most defining moment of my early life.\" After graduating from Newkirk High School in Newkirk, Iowa, in 1944, Schuller continued his education at Hope College, located in Holland, Michigan. In 1950, now studying at Western Theological Seminary, Schuller received his Master of Divinity degree. The seminary teaches in the theological tradition and practice of John Calvin. He was soon ordained as a minister in the Reformed Church in America. After his ordination, he first worked at Ivanhoe Reformed Church in Riverdale, Illinois, before moving to Garden Grove, California. In Garden Grove, California in 1955 Schuller opened what would be his first church in the area, which he called the \u201cGarden Grove Community Church.\u201d At the time, Schuller was trying out a relatively new concept in \u201cchurch service presentation\u201d known as the \u201cDrive-in Church Model.\u201c His new church was located in the old Orange Drive-in Movie Theater where churchgoers could enjoy their church services from the comfort of their own cars. For the benefit of those who preferred more traditional church services, he later also rented a 300-seat former Baptist church, about four miles (6 km) down the road from his new drive-in theater church. On Sunday mornings Schuller would first preside at a 9:30 service in the Baptist chapel and then he would deliver his organ to the roof of the concession stand at the old drive-in theater where he would then preside over his second Sunday service. As the size of the congregations grew, Schuller purchased 10 acres (4.0 ha) of land at 12141 Lewis Street in Garden Grove for a \"walk-in, drive-in\" church, serving both congregations. Ground was broken September 10, 1958 for construction of Schuller's second church-home in the area, which was designed by international architect Richard Neutra. This second church was completed in 1961, at a cost of $3 million (equivalent to $29 million in 2022). The dedication service was held November 5, 1961. The design\n\nquestion: When was Reverend Robert H. Schuller diagnosed with esophageal cancer?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "April 2013", "usage": 1148}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Schuller\n\nevidence:  of the new church building enabled Schuller to preach his sermons to worshipers in 500 cars, as well as to members of the congregation inside the church. Schuller's second area church was built on what was to later become a part of the campus of his future (and much larger) \"Crystal Cathedral Church.\" Seven years later in 1968 a \"Tower of Hope\" steeple structure was added onto the north side of the property. The Tower of Hope structure rose 13 stories (approximately 130 to 150 feet (40 to 46 m) into the air and was the tallest structure in Orange County at that time. The steeple structure was then topped by an illuminated cross which added another 90 feet (27 m) to the structure's overall height. Also in 1968, Schuller purchased a 10-acre (4.0 ha) walnut grove that had bordered on the north boundary of the then current Garden Grove Community Church property. This new purchase of land was to enable the construction of a future much larger Crystal Cathedral on the newly expanded property. The architectural firm of Philip Johnson/John Burgee was soon retained to draw up plans for a primarily glass church that would be able to accommodate over 2,000 church goers, which was to be built on a spot on the newly expanded church campus adjacent to the original church structure. In order to meet the needs of the church's ever expanding congregation, the architectural firm designed a reflective glass building that could seat 2,248 people. At the time that it was built, the church was touted as \"the largest glass building in the world.\" The church was dedicated on September 14, 1980. Once the newer, larger, and more noticeable \"Crystal Cathedral\" structure was completed, Schuller renamed his organization as the \"Crystal Cathedral Ministries.\" Schuller's Crystal Cathedral Church soon became the iconic backdrop from which he preached his popular Hour of Power broadcasts every Sunday morning for the next 25 years. These broadcasts regularly reached a world wide audience of 20 million. Schuller emphasized what he believed are the positive aspects of the Christian faith. He deliberately avoided condemning people for sin, believing that Jesus \"met needs before touting creeds\". Once in a relationship with God, Schuller emphasized, someone who is sowing positive faith in his heart and actions will discover that the by-product is a reduction of sin. He was known to say, \"Sin is a condition before it is an action.\" Schuller encouraged Christians and non-Christians to achieve great things through God and to believe in their dreams. He wrote, \"If you can dream it, you can do it!\" As the Crystal Cathedral's founding pastor, Schuller was seen and heard internationally on Sundays on the world's most widely watched hour-long church service, the Hour of Power, 1,500 of which were recorded. On June 15, 1950, Schuller married Arvella De Haan (1929\u20132014), a church organist, who became instrumental in developing the music department at the Crystal Cathedral and was the creator and producer of the Hour of Power for over 40 years. The Schullers had five children: Sheila, Tim, Robert, Jeanne, Carol, and Gretchen. On January 22, 2006, Schuller's son, Robert A. Schuller, assumed the role of senior pastor of the Crystal Cathedral. On October 25, 2008, however, he resigned. His father cited \"a lack of shared vision\" as the cause. Schuller stated that \"different ideas as to the direction and the vision for this ministry\" with his son \"made it necessary... to part ways in the Hour of Power television ministry\". Schuller also said \"I love my son and am proud of my son\" and that the long-term survival of his ministry was dependent on expanding its imprint beyond the Schuller name. \"The real minister's name that we honor is Jesus, not Schuller\", he said. The ministry then opened the pulpit to a variety of notable Christian speakers. On June 11, 2009, Schuller announced that the church's leadership would pass to his eldest daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman. On July 11, 2010, he announced that he was retiring as principal pastor of the Crystal Cathedral and would become chairman of the church's board of directors. After a year as interim senior pastor, Sheila Schuller Coleman was elevated to senior pastor in July 2010. In the wake of Robert Schuller's retirement and after much sorting out, in 2013 Robert H. Schuller's grandson, Bobby V. Schuller moved the remaining congregation from the Crystal Cathedral building and eventually into the somewhat smaller Shepherd's Grove church building in nearby Irvine, CA. Along the way, from 2013 through 2018 the congregation also temporarily leased what had formerly been the St. Callistus Catholic church of Garden Grove for their Sunday services. During these years Schuller's grandson took over the leadership of the remaining congregation and also resumed the broadcast of his grandfather's Hour\n\nquestion: When was Reverend Robert H.

The Crystal Cathedral building and its campus was then sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange for use as its diocesan cathedral and offices. Subsequently, the Diocese of Orange renamed the building as the Christ Cathedral. On October 18, 2010, Coleman announced that the Crystal Cathedral was seeking bankruptcy protection, in the midst of what became known as the Great Recession. In May 2011, the senior Schullers, along with their daughter Carol and her husband Tim, were dismissed from the ministry at the Crystal Cathedral. They filed for bankruptcy. The court would eventually allow them approximately 20 percent of what they were owed. The creditors would be paid in full plus interest. In July 2011, it was reported in the Orange County Register that Schuller had been ousted from the Crystal Cathedral board. In July 2011, Coleman attempted to reverse the decision that had been made in her absence, saying, \"Dad will continue to provide leadership for this ministry through me for as long as possible\" and, \"I have and will continue to defer to his wisdom and honor him for his unprecedented accomplishments.\" On March 11, 2012, after months of attempting to change the attitude of the ministry's board, Coleman told the Crystal Cathedral congregation that she was leaving to start a new church because of \"a hostile work environment\". The International Business Times reported that this came following \"a bitter fallout between the ministry and its founding family\". According to the Religion News Service, the founders were left with little to no assets; their home was fully mortgaged. On January 24, 2013, the Crystal Cathedral's board of directors voted to make Bobby Schuller, Schuller's grandson (son of Robert Anthony Schuller), the new pastor for the Hour of Power television program as well as a non-voting member of the board. In late August 2013, Robert H. Schuller was diagnosed with esophageal cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes. A follow-up examination in September 2013 presented Schuller with the possibility of undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy that could extend his life. Schuller then agreed to receive the cancer treatments, which may have been responsible for extending his life by nearly two more years as had been predicted by his physicians. Arvella Schuller died on February 11, 2014, aged 84. The Schullers had been married for 63 years. Schuller died peacefully, early on the morning of April 2, 2015 at a nursing facility in Artesia, California, aged 88. His funeral was held at Christ Cathedral, the former campus of the Crystal Cathedral. He is interred next to his wife at the Christ Cathedral Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Garden Grove, California. Schuller authored over 30 hardcover books, 6 of which made The New York Times and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists, including:\n\nquestion: When was Reverend Robert H.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Crystal Cathedral founder and former televangelist the Rev. Robert H. Schuller has been diagnosed with cancer, his daughter said Thursday. Carol Schuller Milner told The Associated Press that Schuller, 86, has a fist-sized tumor in his esophagus that has spread to his lymph nodes. Schuller's oncologists said the tumor was either at or near stage 4 \u2014 the most serious cancer classification \u2014 but it has yet to reach his vital organs and he has been strong enough for treatment. Milner said her father \"doesn't have a lot of energy\" but has been \"very reflective, very peaceful and truly beautiful.\" \"He's closer to heaven than he is to this tangible world,\" Milner said. Another daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman, first revealed news that Schuller was undergoing treatment in an Aug. 25 sermon at her new church, the Hope Center of Christ. The elder Schuller decided to pursue the treatment after praying with his wife, Arvella, and other family members, Schuller Coleman said. Doctors said the televangelist had three months to live, but then said he could live for two years with radiation and chemotherapy. Schuller began preaching in 1955 from the top of a drive-in movie theater concession stand in Orange County and by 1970 had launched a TV ministry with the \"Hour of Power.\" He built the landmark cathedral in 1980. At its peak, the broadcast attracted 20 million viewers around the world but in recent years, Schuller's ministry was hamstrung by a disastrous leadership transition and a decline in viewership and donations. The once-popular televangelist resigned from the church's board in 2012, two years after the ministry filed for bankruptcy. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange bought the cathedral in bankruptcy proceedings and renamed the building Christ Cathedral.

Despite the \"tragedy\" of family dissension that marked the end of Schuller's career, evangelical scholar Richard Mouw said he was \"one of the great church leaders in the 20th century. \"The very idea of the original congregation in Anaheim, of a drive-in church, was very innovative,\" said Mouw, the former president of Fuller Theological Seminary. \"It was, I think, motivated in great part by a desire to reach people who ordinarily would not come to a church.\" But as other large church leaders took megachurch ministries and religious broadcasting in new directions, Schuller had a devotion to the Protestant tradition and maintained the \"dignity of worship,\" Mouw said, wearing a clerical robe on international television and having a renowned choir and \"one of the finest organs in the world.\" The author of more than 30 books, including five New York Times best-sellers, Robert Schuller was best known for his four decades of televised Sunday services, Hour of Power. From his soaring Crystal Cathedral, Schuller's program was broadcast in five languages and 50 nations, with a worldwide audience of 20 million per week. Along the way, his popularity in America surpassed the likes of Oral Roberts and Pat Robertson. It was a distinction that Schuller wore well. Earlier in his career, he had emerged largely unscathed from the \"earthquake,\" as he called it \u2014 the Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart scandals of the late 1980s that had rocked the world of televangelism. Schuller was also one of the most touted leaders of the Reformed Church in America, which sometimes identified itself as \"the denomination of Norman Vincent Peale and Robert Schuller.\" But like Peale, Schuller had his share of critics. Some Christians were scornful of his celebration of \"possibility thinking,\" and attacked his \"theology of self-esteem,\" saying that it muted biblical warnings of sin and evil through a blend of gospel and psychology. That combination, they said, treated morality as merely a relative code of values. Schuller dismissed the charges. \"I don't think anything has been done in the name of Christ and under the banner of Christianity that has proven more destructive to human personality and, hence, counterproductive to the evangelism enterprise than the often crude, uncouth, and un-Christian strategy of attempting to make people aware of their lost and sinful condition,\" Schuller told Christianity Today. This view surfaced notably in 1998, when \u2014 at the height of then-President Clinton's sex scandal \u2014 Schuller tempered criticism of Clinton by saying \"we all share part of the shame.\" He argued that the nation's stubbornly high approval ratings of Clinton had enabled the president to avoid confronting his behavior. The year before, Schuller had been thanked by Clinton in a State of the Union address, in which Clinton credited the evangelist with advising him to read Isaiah for strength in leading America. Born in 1926, Schuller was reared in a religious Iowan family of Dutch descent. He later said he knew he wanted to be a minister. As part of his seminary studies, he wrote an index of Calvin's four-volume Institutes of the Christian Religion. In 1950, after receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree from Hope College and a Master of Divinity from Western Theological Seminary, he was ordained by the Re\n\nquestion: When was Reverend Robert H.

He soon entered the pastorate at one of the denomination's churches in Chicago, which over the next five years grew from 38 to 400 members. Then in 1955, he was sent to Orange County, Calif., to establish a church. After trying unsuccessfully to rent a facility, Schuller \u2014 with his wife Arvella as organist and $500 in assets \u2014 finally settled on a drive-in theater where he held Sunday services from a snack bar's roof. While attracting worshippers, Schuller gravitated toward the teachings of Peale, pastor of New York's Marble Collegiate Church, whom he credited with fine-tuning his faith and laying the foundation for the \"possibility thinking\" that was to come. His congregation grew steadily. By the 1970s, Schuller was a widely televised preacher whose Garden Grove Community Church in Orange County became a pioneering megachurch, and in the years ahead, he solicited New York architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee to design a modern cathedral. The result, a huge sanctuary with thousands of windows of reflective glass became known as the Crystal Cathedral and opened in 1980. With the exception of Disneyland, the church \u2014 which eventually drew more than 10,000 members \u2014 became the most famous architectural work in Orange County. In the late 1980s, reports of both Bakker's and Swaggart's misdeeds caused greater media scrutiny of televangelists \u2014 and their finances. Schuller was among them. A former employee accused him of deceiving followers in a fundraising letter. Then, in 1988, Schuller announced that his church was facing money shortages stemming from the \"shock waves\" echoing through American evangelism. \"That's what happens when you become high-profile.\" Still, by decade's end, the public esteem of Schuller, along with Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell, was far less affected than that of Bakker and Swaggart. In 1997, Schuller was again publicly shamed when an airline flight attendant sued Schuller and his church for more than $2.5 million for what he claimed were injuries sustained during a flight between Los Angeles and New York. The flight attendant said Schuller grabbed his shoulder and repeatedly shook him, causing physical and psychological damage. Schuller denied trying to hurt the man, but said he was only trying to get his attention. \"My actions were inappropriate, considering the circumstances, and wherever he might be I want him to know that I apologize for any portion of my conduct which he found offensive. \u2026 I am 70 years old, but I am not too old to learn or be taught new lessons.\" In the years ahead, Schuller's congregation still grew, with a $25 million structure built on the Crystal Cathedral complex in 1989. Celebrities and politicians \u2014 from Maya Angelou to Mikhail Gorbachev \u2014 visited Schuller's church. In 2003, Schuller opened a new visitors' center, the International Center for Possibility Thinking. Thousands of individuals were shaped by his message over the years, said Mouw, now a professor of faith and public life at Fuller, who mocked Schuller's \"possibility thinking\" when he first arrived at the seminary in the mid-1980s until several students asked him to stop. \"'That's how we became Christians,'\" the students told him. \"That's why we are in seminary because we were really touched by his ministry.' \u2026 These are people who have gone on to very solid ministries but they credit their initial sense of God's very personal presence in their life and their call for ministry to the influence of Robert Schuller.\" The Rev. Wes Granberg-Michaelson, general secretary emeritus of the Reformed Church in America, said Schuller was the most widely known minister of his denomination. \"As international television broadcasting opened up new markets, the 'Hour of Power' was often there, and watched by those \u2014 including church leaders, kings, generals, and prime ministers \u2014 who now had access to satellite TV,\" he said. \"While his actual ministry eventually crumbled in tragedy, the Cathedral \u2014 now Christ Cathedral \u2014 still stands, and is a testimony to Schuller's imaginative vision.\" After dealing with bankruptcy and his resignation, Schuller made occasional appearances at his daughter's church. When Schuller read Scripture at Coleman's church on Easter Sunday 2013, she recalled how he trained her as the family read the Bible around the table after dinner. \"More often than not, I'd just get started reading and Dad would say, 'Stop. Do it again, Sheila. This time with feeling,'\" she said, imitating her father's deep voice. \"So you can blame him if you think my messages have too much feeling.\" That Easter, he read from 1 Corinthians: \"Oh death, where is your sting? Oh Hades, where is your victory? Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Schuller is survived by five children and more than\n\nquestion: When was Reverend Robert H.

Schuller\n\nevidence: Robert Harold Schuller (September 16, 1926 \u2013 April 2, 2015) was an American Christian televangelist, pastor, motivational speaker, and author. In his five decades of television, Schuller was principally known for the weekly Hour of Power television program, which he began hosting in 1970 until his retirement in 2006. His grandson, Bobby Schuller, carries on the Hour of Power now airing for over fifty years. During his time as a minister, Schuller oversaw the construction of two churches in Garden Grove, CA. The first church built under his tenure was the Garden Grove Community Church chapel, which seated 500, and the second that he oversaw was the building of the much larger Crystal Cathedral, which has a seating capacity of 2,200. Schuller began broadcasting his Hour of Power program from the smaller Garden Grove chapel in 1969. He made the decision to begin his broadcast of Hour of Power shortly after he had received encouragement from longtime friend Billy Graham during a visit with the popular evangelist. The Hour of Power broadcast later continued in the Crystal Cathedral. Like his good friend Billy Graham, the Schuller organization never became closely associated with any major scandal. During the 90's his televised sermons were regularly viewed by an estimated audience of 20 million. Schuller's weekly telecast of his sermons which began in 1969 was one of the first instances of such weekly televised church services, and was the world's most widely watched hour-long church service ever. Robert Harold Schuller was born on September 16, 1926, near Alton, Iowa, the second son of Jennie (n\u00e9e Beltman; 1891\u20131970) and Anthony Schuller (1882\u20131964). He was the youngest of five children. All of his grandparents were Dutch immigrants, and he was raised on his parents' farm nearby in a small, close-knit community of Dutch-Americans, without running water. In 1927 on the day of his baptism at his family\u2019s Reformed Church in Newkirk, Iowa, the six month old Schuller was clothed in a certain \"baptismal-gown.\u201d Years later Schuller announced that he had kept his baptismal-gown and placed it on display in his office, referring to it as his most-prized-possession. To Schuller apparently the gown had represented the day that his life had first been dedicated to God. In his later years Schuller placed an inscription beneath the gown reading: \"This is the reason my life has been a success. As a child I was dedicated to our Lord.\" In 1931, just weeks before his fifth birthday a visiting uncle who was a minister had predicted that the young boy was destined to spread the word of God to many when he grew up. Schuller called the moment that he had first heard his uncle's prediction the \"single most defining moment of my early life.\" After graduating from Newkirk High School in Newkirk, Iowa, in 1944, Schuller continued his education at Hope College, located in Holland, Michigan. In 1950, now studying at Western Theological Seminary, Schuller received his Master of Divinity degree. The seminary teaches in the theological tradition and practice of John Calvin. He was soon ordained as a minister in the Reformed Church in America. After his ordination, he first worked at Ivanhoe Reformed Church in Riverdale, Illinois, before moving to Garden Grove, California. In Garden Grove, California in 1955 Schuller opened what would be his first church in the area, which he called the \u201cGarden Grove Community Church.\u201d At the time, Schuller was trying out a relatively new concept in \u201cchurch service presentation\u201d known as the \u201cDrive-in Church Model.\u201c His new church was located in the old Orange Drive-in Movie Theater where churchgoers could enjoy their church services from the comfort of their own cars. For the benefit of those who preferred more traditional church services, he later also rented a 300-seat former Baptist church, about four miles (6 km) down the road from his new drive-in theater church. On Sunday mornings Schuller would first preside at a 9:30 service in the Baptist chapel and then he would deliver his organ to the roof of the concession stand at the old drive-in theater where he would then preside over his second Sunday service. As the size of the congregations grew, Schuller purchased 10 acres (4.0 ha) of land at 12141 Lewis Street in Garden Grove for a \"walk-in, drive-in\" church, serving both congregations. Ground was broken September 10, 1958 for construction of Schuller's second church-home in the area, which was designed by international architect Richard Neutra. This second church was completed in 1961, at a cost of $3 million (equivalent to $29 million in 2022). The dedication service was held November 5, 1961. The design\n\nquestion: What treatment options were presented to Reverend Robert H. Schuller?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1144}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Schuller\n\nevidence:  of the new church building enabled Schuller to preach his sermons to worshipers in 500 cars, as well as to members of the congregation inside the church. Schuller's second area church was built on what was to later become a part of the campus of his future (and much larger) \"Crystal Cathedral Church.\" Seven years later in 1968 a \"Tower of Hope\" steeple structure was added onto the north side of the property. The Tower of Hope structure rose 13 stories (approximately 130 to 150 feet (40 to 46 m) into the air and was the tallest structure in Orange County at that time. The steeple structure was then topped by an illuminated cross which added another 90 feet (27 m) to the structure's overall height. Also in 1968, Schuller purchased a 10-acre (4.0 ha) walnut grove that had bordered on the north boundary of the then current Garden Grove Community Church property. This new purchase of land was to enable the construction of a future much larger Crystal Cathedral on the newly expanded property. The architectural firm of Philip Johnson/John Burgee was soon retained to draw up plans for a primarily glass church that would be able to accommodate over 2,000 church goers, which was to be built on a spot on the newly expanded church campus adjacent to the original church structure. In order to meet the needs of the church's ever expanding congregation, the architectural firm designed a reflective glass building that could seat 2,248 people. At the time that it was built, the church was touted as \"the largest glass building in the world.\" The church was dedicated on September 14, 1980. Once the newer, larger, and more noticeable \"Crystal Cathedral\" structure was completed, Schuller renamed his organization as the \"Crystal Cathedral Ministries.\" Schuller's Crystal Cathedral Church soon became the iconic backdrop from which he preached his popular Hour of Power broadcasts every Sunday morning for the next 25 years. These broadcasts regularly reached a world wide audience of 20 million. Schuller emphasized what he believed are the positive aspects of the Christian faith. He deliberately avoided condemning people for sin, believing that Jesus \"met needs before touting creeds\". Once in a relationship with God, Schuller emphasized, someone who is sowing positive faith in his heart and actions will discover that the by-product is a reduction of sin. He was known to say, \"Sin is a condition before it is an action.\" Schuller encouraged Christians and non-Christians to achieve great things through God and to believe in their dreams. He wrote, \"If you can dream it, you can do it!\" As the Crystal Cathedral's founding pastor, Schuller was seen and heard internationally on Sundays on the world's most widely watched hour-long church service, the Hour of Power, 1,500 of which were recorded. On June 15, 1950, Schuller married Arvella De Haan (1929\u20132014), a church organist, who became instrumental in developing the music department at the Crystal Cathedral and was the creator and producer of the Hour of Power for over 40 years. The Schullers had five children: Sheila, Tim, Robert, Jeanne, Carol, and Gretchen. On January 22, 2006, Schuller's son, Robert A. Schuller, assumed the role of senior pastor of the Crystal Cathedral. On October 25, 2008, however, he resigned. His father cited \"a lack of shared vision\" as the cause. Schuller stated that \"different ideas as to the direction and the vision for this ministry\" with his son \"made it necessary... to part ways in the Hour of Power television ministry\". Schuller also said \"I love my son and am proud of my son\" and that the long-term survival of his ministry was dependent on expanding its imprint beyond the Schuller name. \"The real minister's name that we honor is Jesus, not Schuller\", he said. The ministry then opened the pulpit to a variety of notable Christian speakers. On June 11, 2009, Schuller announced that the church's leadership would pass to his eldest daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman. On July 11, 2010, he announced that he was retiring as principal pastor of the Crystal Cathedral and would become chairman of the church's board of directors. After a year as interim senior pastor, Sheila Schuller Coleman was elevated to senior pastor in July 2010. In the wake of Robert Schuller's retirement and after much sorting out, in 2013 Robert H. Schuller's grandson, Bobby V. Schuller moved the remaining congregation from the Crystal Cathedral building and eventually into the somewhat smaller Shepherd's Grove church building in nearby Irvine, CA. Along the way, from 2013 through 2018 the congregation also temporarily leased what had formerly been the St. Callistus Catholic church of Garden Grove for their Sunday services. During these years Schuller's grandson took over the leadership of the remaining congregation and also resumed the broadcast of his grandfather's Hour\n\nquestion: What treatment options were presented to Reverend Robert H.

Subsequently, the Diocese of Orange renamed the building as the Christ Cathedral. On October 18, 2010, Coleman announced that the Crystal Cathedral was seeking bankruptcy protection, in the midst of what became known as the Great Recession. In May 2011, the senior Schullers, along with their daughter Carol and her husband Tim, were dismissed from the ministry at the Crystal Cathedral. They filed for bankruptcy. The court would eventually allow them approximately 20 percent of what they were owed. The creditors would be paid in full plus interest. In July 2011, it was reported in the Orange County Register that Schuller had been ousted from the Crystal Cathedral board. In July 2011, Coleman attempted to reverse the decision that had been made in her absence, saying, \"Dad will continue to provide leadership for this ministry through me for as long as possible\" and, \"I have and will continue to defer to his wisdom and honor him for his unprecedented accomplishments.\" On March 11, 2012, after months of attempting to change the attitude of the ministry's board, Coleman told the Crystal Cathedral congregation that she was leaving to start a new church because of \"a hostile work environment\". The International Business Times reported that this came following \"a bitter fallout between the ministry and its founding family\". According to the Religion News Service, the founders were left with little to no assets; their home was fully mortgaged. On January 24, 2013, the Crystal Cathedral's board of directors voted to make Bobby Schuller, Schuller's grandson (son of Robert Anthony Schuller), the new pastor for the Hour of Power television program as well as a non-voting member of the board. In late August 2013, Robert H. Schuller was diagnosed with esophageal cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes. A follow-up examination in September 2013 presented Schuller with the possibility of undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy that could extend his life. Schuller then agreed to receive the cancer treatments, which may have been responsible for extending his life by nearly two more years as had been predicted by his physicians. Arvella Schuller died on February 11, 2014, aged 84. The Schullers had been married for 63 years. Schuller died peacefully, early on the morning of April 2, 2015 at a nursing facility in Artesia, California, aged 88. His funeral was held at Christ Cathedral, the former campus of the Crystal Cathedral. He is interred next to his wife at the Christ Cathedral Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Garden Grove, California. Schuller authored over 30 hardcover books, 6 of which made The New York Times and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists, including:\n\nquestion: What treatment options were presented to Reverend Robert H.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Crystal Cathedral founder and former televangelist the Rev. Robert H. Schuller has been diagnosed with cancer, his daughter said Thursday. Carol Schuller Milner told The Associated Press that Schuller, 86, has a fist-sized tumor in his esophagus that has spread to his lymph nodes. Schuller's oncologists said the tumor was either at or near stage 4 \u2014 the most serious cancer classification \u2014 but it has yet to reach his vital organs and he has been strong enough for treatment. Milner said her father \"doesn't have a lot of energy\" but has been \"very reflective, very peaceful and truly beautiful.\" \"He's closer to heaven than he is to this tangible world,\" Milner said. Another daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman, first revealed news that Schuller was undergoing treatment in an Aug. 25 sermon at her new church, the Hope Center of Christ. The elder Schuller decided to pursue the treatment after praying with his wife, Arvella, and other family members, Schuller Coleman said. Doctors said the televangelist had three months to live, but then said he could live for two years with radiation and chemotherapy. Schuller began preaching in 1955 from the top of a drive-in movie theater concession stand in Orange County and by 1970 had launched a TV ministry with the \"Hour of Power.\" He built the landmark cathedral in 1980. At its peak, the broadcast attracted 20 million viewers around the world but in recent years, Schuller's ministry was hamstrung by a disastrous leadership transition and a decline in viewership and donations. The once-popular televangelist resigned from the church's board in 2012, two years after the ministry filed for bankruptcy. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange bought the cathedral in bankruptcy proceedings and renamed the building Christ Cathedral.

Schuller, who attempted to integrate the teachings of John Calvin with the positive thinking of Norman Vincent Peale, and lost his famed Crystal Cathedral to bankruptcy, died Thursday at age 88, according to the Hour of Power ministry he started. He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in the summer of 2013. After becoming one of the nation's best-known pastors, Schuller watched his megachurch empire \u2014 that started in a drive-in theater \u2014 crumble amid huge debt and family squabbles over leadership. In 2011, a bankruptcy proceeding reached a $57.5 million deal to permit the Catholic Diocese of Orange to purchase the iconic glass sanctuary in Garden Grove, Calif. The remaining Protestant congregation, Shepherd's Grove, moved to a Roman Catholic church building with half the seating capacity of its former home, led by Schuller's grandson, Bobby Schuller. \"I have the incredible honor of carrying on my grandfather's legacy by teaching people that they are not what they do, not what they have, and not what people say about them. They are the beloved of God,\" Bobby Schuller said in a statement. In 2012, Robert H. and Arvella Schuller resigned from the ministry they began more than 50 years before, citing differences with its board. Their only son Robert A. Schuller, onetime heir apparent, served as senior pastor for two years, resigning in 2008 after disputes about the ministry's direction. Sheila Schuller Coleman, their oldest daughter, took on the pastoral role but left in 2012 and started a church nearby. Despite the \"tragedy\" of family dissension that marked the end of Schuller's career, evangelical scholar Richard Mouw said he was \"one of the great church leaders in the 20th century. \"The very idea of the original congregation in Anaheim, of a drive-in church, was very innovative,\" said Mouw, the former president of Fuller Theological Seminary. \"It was, I think, motivated in great part by a desire to reach people who ordinarily would not come to a church.\" But as other large church leaders took megachurch ministries and religious broadcasting in new directions, Schuller had a devotion to the Protestant tradition and maintained the \"dignity of worship,\" Mouw said, wearing a clerical robe on international television and having a renowned choir and \"one of the finest organs in the world.\" The author of more than 30 books, including five New York Times best-sellers, Robert Schuller was best known for his four decades of televised Sunday services, Hour of Power.

Along the way, his popularity in America surpassed the likes of Oral Roberts and Pat Robertson. It was a distinction that Schuller wore well. Earlier in his career, he had emerged largely unscathed from the \"earthquake,\" as he called it \u2014 the Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart scandals of the late 1980s that had rocked the world of televangelism. Schuller was also one of the most touted leaders of the Reformed Church in America, which sometimes identified itself as \"the denomination of Norman Vincent Peale and Robert Schuller.\" But like Peale, Schuller had his share of critics. Some Christians were scornful of his celebration of \"possibility thinking,\" and attacked his \"theology of self-esteem,\" saying that it muted biblical warnings of sin and evil through a blend of gospel and psychology. That combination, they said, treated morality as merely a relative code of values. Schuller dismissed the charges. \"I don't think anything has been done in the name of Christ and under the banner of Christianity that has proven more destructive to human personality and, hence, counterproductive to the evangelism enterprise than the often crude, uncouth, and un-Christian strategy of attempting to make people aware of their lost and sinful condition,\" Schuller told Christianity Today. This view surfaced notably in 1998, when \u2014 at the height of then-President Clinton's sex scandal \u2014 Schuller tempered criticism of Clinton by saying \"we all share part of the shame.\" He argued that the nation's stubbornly high approval ratings of Clinton had enabled the president to avoid confronting his behavior. The year before, Schuller had been thanked by Clinton in a State of the Union address, in which Clinton credited the evangelist with advising him to read Isaiah for strength in leading America. Born in 1926, Schuller was reared in a religious Iowan family of Dutch descent. He later said he knew he wanted to be a minister. As part of his seminary studies, he wrote an index of Calvin's four-volume Institutes of the Christian Religion. In 1950, after receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree from Hope College and a Master of Divinity from Western Theological Seminary, he was ordained by the Re\n\nquestion: What treatment options were presented to Reverend Robert H.

Schuller\n\nevidence: formed Church in America. He soon entered the pastorate at one of the denomination's churches in Chicago, which over the next five years grew from 38 to 400 members. Then in 1955, he was sent to Orange County, Calif., to establish a church. After trying unsuccessfully to rent a facility, Schuller \u2014 with his wife Arvella as organist and $500 in assets \u2014 finally settled on a drive-in theater where he held Sunday services from a snack bar's roof. While attracting worshippers, Schuller gravitated toward the teachings of Peale, pastor of New York's Marble Collegiate Church, whom he credited with fine-tuning his faith and laying the foundation for the \"possibility thinking\" that was to come. His congregation grew steadily. By the 1970s, Schuller was a widely televised preacher whose Garden Grove Community Church in Orange County became a pioneering megachurch, and in the years ahead, he solicited New York architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee to design a modern cathedral. The result, a huge sanctuary with thousands of windows of reflective glass became known as the Crystal Cathedral and opened in 1980. With the exception of Disneyland, the church \u2014 which eventually drew more than 10,000 members \u2014 became the most famous architectural work in Orange County. In the late 1980s, reports of both Bakker's and Swaggart's misdeeds caused greater media scrutiny of televangelists \u2014 and their finances. Schuller was among them. A former employee accused him of deceiving followers in a fundraising letter. Then, in 1988, Schuller announced that his church was facing money shortages stemming from the \"shock waves\" echoing through American evangelism. \"That's what happens when you become high-profile.\" Still, by decade's end, the public esteem of Schuller, along with Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell, was far less affected than that of Bakker and Swaggart. In 1997, Schuller was again publicly shamed when an airline flight attendant sued Schuller and his church for more than $2.5 million for what he claimed were injuries sustained during a flight between Los Angeles and New York. The flight attendant said Schuller grabbed his shoulder and repeatedly shook him, causing physical and psychological damage. Schuller denied trying to hurt the man, but said he was only trying to get his attention. \"My actions were inappropriate, considering the circumstances, and wherever he might be I want him to know that I apologize for any portion of my conduct which he found offensive. \u2026 I am 70 years old, but I am not too old to learn or be taught new lessons.\" In the years ahead, Schuller's congregation still grew, with a $25 million structure built on the Crystal Cathedral complex in 1989. Celebrities and politicians \u2014 from Maya Angelou to Mikhail Gorbachev \u2014 visited Schuller's church. In 2003, Schuller opened a new visitors' center, the International Center for Possibility Thinking. Thousands of individuals were shaped by his message over the years, said Mouw, now a professor of faith and public life at Fuller, who mocked Schuller's \"possibility thinking\" when he first arrived at the seminary in the mid-1980s until several students asked him to stop. \"'That's how we became Christians,'\" the students told him. \"That's why we are in seminary because we were really touched by his ministry.' \u2026 These are people who have gone on to very solid ministries but they credit their initial sense of God's very personal presence in their life and their call for ministry to the influence of Robert Schuller.\" The Rev. Wes Granberg-Michaelson, general secretary emeritus of the Reformed Church in America, said Schuller was the most widely known minister of his denomination. \"As international television broadcasting opened up new markets, the 'Hour of Power' was often there, and watched by those \u2014 including church leaders, kings, generals, and prime ministers \u2014 who now had access to satellite TV,\" he said. \"While his actual ministry eventually crumbled in tragedy, the Cathedral \u2014 now Christ Cathedral \u2014 still stands, and is a testimony to Schuller's imaginative vision.\" After dealing with bankruptcy and his resignation, Schuller made occasional appearances at his daughter's church. When Schuller read Scripture at Coleman's church on Easter Sunday 2013, she recalled how he trained her as the family read the Bible around the table after dinner. \"More often than not, I'd just get started reading and Dad would say, 'Stop. Do it again, Sheila. This time with feeling,'\" she said, imitating her father's deep voice. \"So you can blame him if you think my messages have too much feeling.\" That Easter, he read from 1 Corinthians: \"Oh death, where is your sting? Oh Hades, where is your victory? Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Schuller is survived by five children and more than\n\nquestion: What treatment options were presented to Reverend Robert H.
