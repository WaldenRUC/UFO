All Rights Reserved. DURHAM, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The swift discovery of the person who hung a noose at Duke University leaves questions ranging from the student\u2019s identity to what punishment the person will face. The university has begun disciplinary proceedings that could result in suspension or expulsion, while federal and state law enforcement officials are investigating whether the action constitutes a crime. The university identified the person after several fellow students came forward with information, and the undergraduate student admitted to hanging the noose from a tree at a plaza in the heart of campus, university spokesman Michael Schoenfeld said Thursday. Schoenfeld said the student has left campus but is still enrolled. He declined to describe the culprit\u2019s gender, race or whether the student had been in trouble in the past, citing privacy laws. On Thursday, the plaza where the noose was hung teemed with students enjoying a sunny afternoon and discussing what happened. Sarah Burks, a junior English major from North Carolina, said punishing the culprit is the right move but that it\u2019s not going to change a campus culture in which \u201cthere\u2019s definitely still a lot of separation between different groups.\u201d She says friends of hers have experienced racism on campus. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else they can do when something like this ends up on the front page of the New York Times. They have to find the person,\u201d she said of university administrators. Officials say the noose was found about 2 a.m. Wednesday in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building. Black Student Alliance vice president Henry Washington said he and about 14 other students saw the noose hanging overnight after being alerted via Twitter. On Thursday, he praised the reaction of fellow students and administrators at the school. \u201cI appreciate that immediate action was taken both by the student community to identify a person and by the faculty to ensure that disciplinary action is taken,\u201d he said. Duke Student Affairs Vice President Larry Moneta said the student responsible for the noose would face judgment under the school\u2019s code of conduct, which includes penalties ranging from probation to expulsion. He said it was \u201ctoo soon to make any comment\u201d about whether the student had expressed remorse. \u201cThis is all part of what the investigation will yield and the opportunity for the student to speak to the basis for the behavior,\u201d Moneta said. At a gathering Wednesday in front of the university\u2019s Gothic chapel building, Duke President Richard Brodhead told a crowd of several thousand that their presence was a rejection of what the noose symbolizes in a region where lynchings were once used to terrorize black residents. And he said that while administrators and campus police investigate the case, it is up to each individual to reject racism. On Thursday, senior math major Marshall Ratliff was walking by the Bryan Center shortly after the announcement that someone admitted hanging the noose. Ratliff said he was happy the person responsible was found out. \u201cDuke is making it clear as a student and faculty community that this sort of bias and antagonism is not going to be tolerated on campus,\u201d he said.

What, if any, punishment the student will face remains unknown. \"The student is no longer on campus,\" Duke spokesman Keith Lawrence said, declining to give any further explanation though noting that no punishment has been issued since the individual has not yet gone through the school's judicial hearing system. \"The student will be subject to Duke\u2019s student conduct process,\" the school statement said. Lawrence told ABC News that he could not speculate on the possible punishment in this case.

A Duke University student has admitted to placing a noose in a tree on the campus in Durham, North Carolina and could be disciplined, a school spokesman said on Thursday. The rope, found on Wednesday, was taken down by school officials, who vowed to hold accountable anyone found responsible for the incident described by an official as an \"act of intimidation.\" More than 1,000 students, faculty and others gathered at events on campus on Wednesday to express outrage over the incident, the school said. The student was identified after the school encouraged anyone with information about the noose to call campus police. Fellow students came forward with information, said school spokesman Keith Lawrence. The student will face an undergraduate student conduct inquiry that could result in a range of sanctions, from lesser disciplinary action, to suspension or expulsion, Lawrence said. \"The university continues to review the circumstances of the incident to determine if additional individuals were involved,\" the school said in a statement, adding that it continues to work with state and federal officials \"about potential criminal violations.\" Officials say the noose was found about 2 a.m. in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building. Black Student Alliance vice president Henry Washington said he and about 14 other students saw the noose hanging overnight after being alerted via Twitter. \u201cWe wanted to see if it was an actual thing. And yeah, there it was,\u201d said Washington, a sophomore from Aliceville, Alabama. President Richard Brodhead and Provost Sally Kornbluth earlier sent a joint email to students, saying the Duke campus \u201chas been jolted over the past few weeks by several racial incidents, including a report of hateful speech directed at students on East Campus\u201d and the discovery of the noose. \u201cTo whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,\u201d Larry Moneta, Duke's vice president for student affairs, wrote in an email to students. Brodhead, Washington and other members of the Black Student Alliance had previously scheduled a meeting Wednesday morning to discuss the campus atmosphere for blacks. \u201cObviously the conversation needed to shift to kind of the things that happened this morning. We expressed to President Brodhead that students were just kind of exhausted. Students didn't know how to feel,\u201d Washington said. A noose in general is a racially charged symbol of lynching, or extrajudicial public execution by hanging, a once common practice in parts of the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By one estimate, some 3,500 African-Americans were lynched from 1882 to 1968. Students Tara-Marie Desruisseaux, 19, of New York, and Jada Gibbs, 19, of Dumont, New Jersey, said the incident came days after they helped host a recruiting weekend at Duke for talented black high school students from around the country. Duke has about 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students. It costs about $60,000 a year to attend as an undergraduate, including room and board, according to the school's website. About half of all undergraduate students receive financial aid. \u201cNow I feel like they're looking back at us and wondering, what were they selling me and what do they accept that they think Duke is so great?\u201d Desruisseaux said. While minorities may be forced to cope with racism at other selective universities, \u201cI think the fact that Duke is in the South gives it something different from Stanford or Harvard,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the way that racism resonates is a lot stronger here just because not that long ago Duke's campus was segregated and the only blacks on this campus were cleaning up bathrooms.\u201d Freshman student Anika Richter said though she is half-Japanese and half-Colombian, growing up in Baltimore meant many of her friends were black. \u201cHonestly, I'm appalled and embarrassed to go to the school right now,\u201d said Richter, who saw a photo of the noose on Facebook just after waking up Wednesday. \u201cComing to Duke, I was very nervous about the racial tensions at the school but I never actually imagined that something so blatantly racist could happen here.\u201d The incident at Duke is the latest alleged racist behavior at a university. Last month, U.S. prosecutors said a former University of Mississippi student had been indicted on civil rights charges accusing him of draping a noose and a Confederate flag around the neck of a statue of that school's first black student.

A Duke University student has admitted to placing a noose in a tree on the campus in Durham, North Carolina and could be disciplined, a school spokesman said on Thursday. The rope, found on Wednesday, was taken down by school officials, who vowed to hold accountable anyone found responsible for the incident described by an official as an \"act of intimidation.\" More than 1,000 students, faculty and others gathered at events on campus on Wednesday to express outrage over the incident, the school said. The student was identified after the school encouraged anyone with information about the noose to call campus police. Fellow students came forward with information, said school spokesman Keith Lawrence. The student will face an undergraduate student conduct inquiry that could result in a range of sanctions, from lesser disciplinary action, to suspension or expulsion, Lawrence said. \"The university continues to review the circumstances of the incident to determine if additional individuals were involved,\" the school said in a statement, adding that it continues to work with state and federal officials \"about potential criminal violations.\" Officials say the noose was found about 2 a.m. in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building. Black Student Alliance vice president Henry Washington said he and about 14 other students saw the noose hanging overnight after being alerted via Twitter. \u201cWe wanted to see if it was an actual thing. And yeah, there it was,\u201d said Washington, a sophomore from Aliceville, Alabama. President Richard Brodhead and Provost Sally Kornbluth earlier sent a joint email to students, saying the Duke campus \u201chas been jolted over the past few weeks by several racial incidents, including a report of hateful speech directed at students on East Campus\u201d and the discovery of the noose. \u201cTo whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,\u201d Larry Moneta, Duke's vice president for student affairs, wrote in an email to students. Brodhead, Washington and other members of the Black Student Alliance had previously scheduled a meeting Wednesday morning to discuss the campus atmosphere for blacks. \u201cObviously the conversation needed to shift to kind of the things that happened this morning. We expressed to President Brodhead that students were just kind of exhausted. Students didn't know how to feel,\u201d Washington said. A noose in general is a racially charged symbol of lynching, or extrajudicial public execution by hanging, a once common practice in parts of the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By one estimate, some 3,500 African-Americans were lynched from 1882 to 1968. Students Tara-Marie Desruisseaux, 19, of New York, and Jada Gibbs, 19, of Dumont, New Jersey, said the incident came days after they helped host a recruiting weekend at Duke for talented black high school students from around the country. Duke has about 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students. It costs about $60,000 a year to attend as an undergraduate, including room and board, according to the school's website. About half of all undergraduate students receive financial aid. \u201cNow I feel like they're looking back at us and wondering, what were they selling me and what do they accept that they think Duke is so great?\u201d Desruisseaux said. While minorities may be forced to cope with racism at other selective universities, \u201cI think the fact that Duke is in the South gives it something different from Stanford or Harvard,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the way that racism resonates is a lot stronger here just because not that long ago Duke's campus was segregated and the only blacks on this campus were cleaning up bathrooms.\u201d Freshman student Anika Richter said though she is half-Japanese and half-Colombian, growing up in Baltimore meant many of her friends were black. \u201cHonestly, I'm appalled and embarrassed to go to the school right now,\u201d said Richter, who saw a photo of the noose on Facebook just after waking up Wednesday. \u201cComing to Duke, I was very nervous about the racial tensions at the school but I never actually imagined that something so blatantly racist could happen here.\u201d The incident at Duke is the latest alleged racist behavior at a university. Last month, U.S. prosecutors said a former University of Mississippi student had been indicted on civil rights charges accusing him of draping a noose and a Confederate flag around the neck of a statue of that school's first black student.

All Rights Reserved. DURHAM, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The swift discovery of the person who hung a noose at Duke University leaves questions ranging from the student\u2019s identity to what punishment the person will face. The university has begun disciplinary proceedings that could result in suspension or expulsion, while federal and state law enforcement officials are investigating whether the action constitutes a crime. The university identified the person after several fellow students came forward with information, and the undergraduate student admitted to hanging the noose from a tree at a plaza in the heart of campus, university spokesman Michael Schoenfeld said Thursday. Schoenfeld said the student has left campus but is still enrolled. He declined to describe the culprit\u2019s gender, race or whether the student had been in trouble in the past, citing privacy laws. On Thursday, the plaza where the noose was hung teemed with students enjoying a sunny afternoon and discussing what happened. Sarah Burks, a junior English major from North Carolina, said punishing the culprit is the right move but that it\u2019s not going to change a campus culture in which \u201cthere\u2019s definitely still a lot of separation between different groups.\u201d She says friends of hers have experienced racism on campus. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else they can do when something like this ends up on the front page of the New York Times. They have to find the person,\u201d she said of university administrators. Officials say the noose was found about 2 a.m. Wednesday in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building. Black Student Alliance vice president Henry Washington said he and about 14 other students saw the noose hanging overnight after being alerted via Twitter. On Thursday, he praised the reaction of fellow students and administrators at the school. \u201cI appreciate that immediate action was taken both by the student community to identify a person and by the faculty to ensure that disciplinary action is taken,\u201d he said. Duke Student Affairs Vice President Larry Moneta said the student responsible for the noose would face judgment under the school\u2019s code of conduct, which includes penalties ranging from probation to expulsion. He said it was \u201ctoo soon to make any comment\u201d about whether the student had expressed remorse. \u201cThis is all part of what the investigation will yield and the opportunity for the student to speak to the basis for the behavior,\u201d Moneta said. At a gathering Wednesday in front of the university\u2019s Gothic chapel building, Duke President Richard Brodhead told a crowd of several thousand that their presence was a rejection of what the noose symbolizes in a region where lynchings were once used to terrorize black residents. And he said that while administrators and campus police investigate the case, it is up to each individual to reject racism. On Thursday, senior math major Marshall Ratliff was walking by the Bryan Center shortly after the announcement that someone admitted hanging the noose. Ratliff said he was happy the person responsible was found out. \u201cDuke is making it clear as a student and faculty community that this sort of bias and antagonism is not going to be tolerated on campus,\u201d he said.

A Duke University student has admitted to placing a noose in a tree on the campus in Durham, North Carolina and could be disciplined, a school spokesman said on Thursday. The rope, found on Wednesday, was taken down by school officials, who vowed to hold accountable anyone found responsible for the incident described by an official as an \"act of intimidation.\" More than 1,000 students, faculty and others gathered at events on campus on Wednesday to express outrage over the incident, the school said. The student was identified after the school encouraged anyone with information about the noose to call campus police. Fellow students came forward with information, said school spokesman Keith Lawrence. The student will face an undergraduate student conduct inquiry that could result in a range of sanctions, from lesser disciplinary action, to suspension or expulsion, Lawrence said. \"The university continues to review the circumstances of the incident to determine if additional individuals were involved,\" the school said in a statement, adding that it continues to work with state and federal officials \"about potential criminal violations.\" Officials say the noose was found about 2 a.m. in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building. Black Student Alliance vice president Henry Washington said he and about 14 other students saw the noose hanging overnight after being alerted via Twitter. \u201cWe wanted to see if it was an actual thing. And yeah, there it was,\u201d said Washington, a sophomore from Aliceville, Alabama. President Richard Brodhead and Provost Sally Kornbluth earlier sent a joint email to students, saying the Duke campus \u201chas been jolted over the past few weeks by several racial incidents, including a report of hateful speech directed at students on East Campus\u201d and the discovery of the noose. \u201cTo whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,\u201d Larry Moneta, Duke's vice president for student affairs, wrote in an email to students. Brodhead, Washington and other members of the Black Student Alliance had previously scheduled a meeting Wednesday morning to discuss the campus atmosphere for blacks. \u201cObviously the conversation needed to shift to kind of the things that happened this morning. We expressed to President Brodhead that students were just kind of exhausted. Students didn't know how to feel,\u201d Washington said. A noose in general is a racially charged symbol of lynching, or extrajudicial public execution by hanging, a once common practice in parts of the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By one estimate, some 3,500 African-Americans were lynched from 1882 to 1968. Students Tara-Marie Desruisseaux, 19, of New York, and Jada Gibbs, 19, of Dumont, New Jersey, said the incident came days after they helped host a recruiting weekend at Duke for talented black high school students from around the country. Duke has about 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students. It costs about $60,000 a year to attend as an undergraduate, including room and board, according to the school's website. About half of all undergraduate students receive financial aid. \u201cNow I feel like they're looking back at us and wondering, what were they selling me and what do they accept that they think Duke is so great?\u201d Desruisseaux said. While minorities may be forced to cope with racism at other selective universities, \u201cI think the fact that Duke is in the South gives it something different from Stanford or Harvard,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the way that racism resonates is a lot stronger here just because not that long ago Duke's campus was segregated and the only blacks on this campus were cleaning up bathrooms.\u201d Freshman student Anika Richter said though she is half-Japanese and half-Colombian, growing up in Baltimore meant many of her friends were black. \u201cHonestly, I'm appalled and embarrassed to go to the school right now,\u201d said Richter, who saw a photo of the noose on Facebook just after waking up Wednesday. \u201cComing to Duke, I was very nervous about the racial tensions at the school but I never actually imagined that something so blatantly racist could happen here.\u201d The incident at Duke is the latest alleged racist behavior at a university. Last month, U.S. prosecutors said a former University of Mississippi student had been indicted on civil rights charges accusing him of draping a noose and a Confederate flag around the neck of a statue of that school's first black student.

The prestigious private school didn\u2019t identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said.

All Rights Reserved. DURHAM, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The swift discovery of the person who hung a noose at Duke University leaves questions ranging from the student\u2019s identity to what punishment the person will face. The university has begun disciplinary proceedings that could result in suspension or expulsion, while federal and state law enforcement officials are investigating whether the action constitutes a crime. The university identified the person after several fellow students came forward with information, and the undergraduate student admitted to hanging the noose from a tree at a plaza in the heart of campus, university spokesman Michael Schoenfeld said Thursday. Schoenfeld said the student has left campus but is still enrolled. He declined to describe the culprit\u2019s gender, race or whether the student had been in trouble in the past, citing privacy laws. On Thursday, the plaza where the noose was hung teemed with students enjoying a sunny afternoon and discussing what happened. Sarah Burks, a junior English major from North Carolina, said punishing the culprit is the right move but that it\u2019s not going to change a campus culture in which \u201cthere\u2019s definitely still a lot of separation between different groups.\u201d She says friends of hers have experienced racism on campus. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else they can do when something like this ends up on the front page of the New York Times. They have to find the person,\u201d she said of university administrators. Officials say the noose was found about 2 a.m. Wednesday in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building. Black Student Alliance vice president Henry Washington said he and about 14 other students saw the noose hanging overnight after being alerted via Twitter. On Thursday, he praised the reaction of fellow students and administrators at the school. \u201cI appreciate that immediate action was taken both by the student community to identify a person and by the faculty to ensure that disciplinary action is taken,\u201d he said. Duke Student Affairs Vice President Larry Moneta said the student responsible for the noose would face judgment under the school\u2019s code of conduct, which includes penalties ranging from probation to expulsion. He said it was \u201ctoo soon to make any comment\u201d about whether the student had expressed remorse. \u201cThis is all part of what the investigation will yield and the opportunity for the student to speak to the basis for the behavior,\u201d Moneta said. At a gathering Wednesday in front of the university\u2019s Gothic chapel building, Duke President Richard Brodhead told a crowd of several thousand that their presence was a rejection of what the noose symbolizes in a region where lynchings were once used to terrorize black residents. And he said that while administrators and campus police investigate the case, it is up to each individual to reject racism. On Thursday, senior math major Marshall Ratliff was walking by the Bryan Center shortly after the announcement that someone admitted hanging the noose. Ratliff said he was happy the person responsible was found out. \u201cDuke is making it clear as a student and faculty community that this sort of bias and antagonism is not going to be tolerated on campus,\u201d he said.

President Richard Brodhead and Provost Sally Kornbluth earlier sent a joint email to students, saying the Duke campus \u201chas been jolted over the past few weeks by several racial incidents, including a report of hateful speech directed at students on East Campus\u201d and the discovery of the noose. \u201cTo whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,\u201d Larry Moneta, Duke's vice president for student affairs, wrote in an email to students. Brodhead, Washington and other members of the Black Student Alliance had previously scheduled a meeting Wednesday morning to discuss the campus atmosphere for blacks. \u201cObviously the conversation needed to shift to kind of the things that happened this morning. We expressed to President Brodhead that students were just kind of exhausted. Students didn't know how to feel,\u201d Washington said. A noose in general is a racially charged symbol of lynching, or extrajudicial public execution by hanging, a once common practice in parts of the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By one estimate, some 3,500 African-Americans were lynched from 1882 to 1968. Students Tara-Marie Desruisseaux, 19, of New York, and Jada Gibbs, 19, of Dumont, New Jersey, said the incident came days after they helped host a recruiting weekend at Duke for talented black high school students from around the country. Duke has about 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students. It costs about $60,000 a year to attend as an undergraduate, including room and board, according to the school's website. About half of all undergraduate students receive financial aid. \u201cNow I feel like they're looking back at us and wondering, what were they selling me and what do they accept that they think Duke is so great?\u201d Desruisseaux said. While minorities may be forced to cope with racism at other selective universities, \u201cI think the fact that Duke is in the South gives it something different from Stanford or Harvard,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the way that racism resonates is a lot stronger here just because not that long ago Duke's campus was segregated and the only blacks on this campus were cleaning up bathrooms.\u201d Freshman student Anika Richter said though she is half-Japanese and half-Colombian, growing up in Baltimore meant many of her friends were black. \u201cHonestly, I'm appalled and embarrassed to go to the school right now,\u201d said Richter, who saw a photo of the noose on Facebook just after waking up Wednesday. \u201cComing to Duke, I was very nervous about the racial tensions at the school but I never actually imagined that something so blatantly racist could happen here.\u201d The incident at Duke is the latest alleged racist behavior at a university. Last month, U.S. prosecutors said a former University of Mississippi student had been indicted on civil rights charges accusing him of draping a noose and a Confederate flag around the neck of a statue of that school's first black student.

The prestigious private school didn\u2019t identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting \u201cWe are not afraid. We stand together,\u201d after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was hung, hundreds of people gathered. \u201cYou came here for the reason that you want to say with me, \u2018This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we\u2019re here to experience. And this is not the Duke we\u2019re here to create,\u2019 \u201d Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a \u201ccowardly act.\u201d \u201cTo whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,\u201d Larry Moneta said.

All Rights Reserved. DURHAM, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The swift discovery of the person who hung a noose at Duke University leaves questions ranging from the student\u2019s identity to what punishment the person will face. The university has begun disciplinary proceedings that could result in suspension or expulsion, while federal and state law enforcement officials are investigating whether the action constitutes a crime. The university identified the person after several fellow students came forward with information, and the undergraduate student admitted to hanging the noose from a tree at a plaza in the heart of campus, university spokesman Michael Schoenfeld said Thursday. Schoenfeld said the student has left campus but is still enrolled. He declined to describe the culprit\u2019s gender, race or whether the student had been in trouble in the past, citing privacy laws. On Thursday, the plaza where the noose was hung teemed with students enjoying a sunny afternoon and discussing what happened. Sarah Burks, a junior English major from North Carolina, said punishing the culprit is the right move but that it\u2019s not going to change a campus culture in which \u201cthere\u2019s definitely still a lot of separation between different groups.\u201d She says friends of hers have experienced racism on campus. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else they can do when something like this ends up on the front page of the New York Times. They have to find the person,\u201d she said of university administrators. Officials say the noose was found about 2 a.m. Wednesday in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building. Black Student Alliance vice president Henry Washington said he and about 14 other students saw the noose hanging overnight after being alerted via Twitter. On Thursday, he praised the reaction of fellow students and administrators at the school. \u201cI appreciate that immediate action was taken both by the student community to identify a person and by the faculty to ensure that disciplinary action is taken,\u201d he said. Duke Student Affairs Vice President Larry Moneta said the student responsible for the noose would face judgment under the school\u2019s code of conduct, which includes penalties ranging from probation to expulsion. He said it was \u201ctoo soon to make any comment\u201d about whether the student had expressed remorse. \u201cThis is all part of what the investigation will yield and the opportunity for the student to speak to the basis for the behavior,\u201d Moneta said. At a gathering Wednesday in front of the university\u2019s Gothic chapel building, Duke President Richard Brodhead told a crowd of several thousand that their presence was a rejection of what the noose symbolizes in a region where lynchings were once used to terrorize black residents. And he said that while administrators and campus police investigate the case, it is up to each individual to reject racism. On Thursday, senior math major Marshall Ratliff was walking by the Bryan Center shortly after the announcement that someone admitted hanging the noose. Ratliff said he was happy the person responsible was found out. \u201cDuke is making it clear as a student and faculty community that this sort of bias and antagonism is not going to be tolerated on campus,\u201d he said.

The college announced that the individual has been identified as a result of its investigation but the person's name has not been released. What, if any, punishment the student will face remains unknown. \"The student is no longer on campus,\" Duke spokesman Keith Lawrence said, declining to give any further explanation though noting that no punishment has been issued since the individual has not yet gone through the school's judicial hearing system. \"The student will be subject to Duke\u2019s student conduct process,\" the school statement said. Lawrence told ABC News that he could not speculate on the possible punishment in this case. In the past, conduct boards made up of a mix of students and faculty members have issued punishments for students found guilty that range from some form of disciplinary action to suspension or expulsion. The investigation into the noose, which was reportedly found hanging from a tree early Wednesday morning, is ongoing as officials said they must determine if the student acted alone. The student may also be subject to criminal charges, depending on what state and federal officials determine. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\n\nquestion: Why did the university not identify the student?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The individual's name has not been released.", "usage": 358}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

A Duke University student has admitted to placing a noose in a tree on the campus in Durham, North Carolina and could be disciplined, a school spokesman said on Thursday. The rope, found on Wednesday, was taken down by school officials, who vowed to hold accountable anyone found responsible for the incident described by an official as an \"act of intimidation.\" More than 1,000 students, faculty and others gathered at events on campus on Wednesday to express outrage over the incident, the school said. The student was identified after the school encouraged anyone with information about the noose to call campus police. Fellow students came forward with information, said school spokesman Keith Lawrence. The student will face an undergraduate student conduct inquiry that could result in a range of sanctions, from lesser disciplinary action, to suspension or expulsion, Lawrence said. \"The university continues to review the circumstances of the incident to determine if additional individuals were involved,\" the school said in a statement, adding that it continues to work with state and federal officials \"about potential criminal violations.\" Officials say the noose was found about 2 a.m. in the plaza outside the Bryan Center, the student commons building.
