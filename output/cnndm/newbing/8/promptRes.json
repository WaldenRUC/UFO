You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six:. In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashanah,\" referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \"Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir.\" And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \"Iran never denied it,\" Zarif tweeted back. \"The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\" The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \"due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\" That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \"born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\" Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961. So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled \"Mr. Ambassador\" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Mohammad Javad Zarif's Diplomatic Career and Relationships\n\nevidence: If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six:. In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashanah,\" referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \"Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir.\" And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \"Iran never denied it,\" Zarif tweeted back. \"The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\" The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \"due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\" That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \"born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\" Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961. So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled \"Mr. Ambassador\" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.\n\n\nquestion: How is Mohammad Javad Zarif known for communicating with the international community?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Zarif tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashanah,\" referring to the Jewish New Year.", "usage": 1009}, "Your task is to judge whether the following two answers are factually consistent.

West, a former one-term congressman and conservative pundit, published an article asserting that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had hidden a close familial connection to an Iranian official with whom he had negotiated a nuclear deal. According to that article (\"You will NOT BELIEVE who was best man at John Kerry's daughter's wedding\"), John Kerry concealed the information that his son-in-law was Iranian during the U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for his position as secretary of state. Moreover, throughout the negotiations over a deal limiting Iran's development of nuclear weapons, Kerry hid the fact that he was buddy-buddy with Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister whom he negotiated the nuclear deal \u2014 so much so that the best man at the wedding of Kerry's daughter was Zarif's son: You not might be aware that in 2009, the daughter of Secretary of State John Kerry, Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerry's younger daughter by his first wife, married an Iranian-American physician named Dr. Brian (Behrooz) Vala Nahed. Of course you're not aware of it. Brian (Behrooz) Nahed is son of Nooshin and Reza Vala Nahid of Los Angeles. Brian's Persian birth name is \"Behrooz Vala Nahid\" but it is now shortened and Americanized in the media to \"Brian Nahed.\" At the time his engagement to Bradford Kerry, there was rarely any mention of Nahed's Persian/Iranian ancestry, and even the official wedding announcement in the October 2009 issue of New York Times carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)'s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college years. Gosh, I wonder why?? Gee, do you think Secretary Kerry should have recused himself from the negotiations with Iran at the very outset because of his long-standing relationship to his Iranian counter-part, Mohammad Javad Zarif? Let me explain. Zarif is the current minister of foreign affairs in the Rouhani administration and has held various significant diplomatic and cabinet posts since the 1990s. He was Kerry's chief counterpart in the nuclear deal negotiations. Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry's daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif's son. Does this bother anyone at all? Apparently Kerry only revealed his daughter's marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of State. But the subject never came up in his Senate confirmation hearing, either because Kerry never disclosed it, or because his former colleagues were \"too polite\" to bring it up. As Front Page Magazine pointed out several months ago, the nuclear talks with Iran were a tragic farce, choreographed and orchestrated by Iran. And unfortunately, we're going to have to live with the consequences. At least, I hope we live. All of this information was wrong. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerry's daughter from his previous marriage to writer Julia Stimson Thorne (from whom he was divorced in 1988), married Brian Vala Nahed on 10 October 2009. Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he is an American-born U.S. citizen who attended school at UCLA and Yale and is currently a neurosurgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital (where his wife is also a physician specializing in critical care). This information has been plainly available for years in his official workplace biography on the Massachusetts General Hospital web site: Dr. Brian Nahed is a neurosurgeon who specializes in brain tumors (glioblastoma, gliomas, metastatic brain tumors, and meningiomas) as well as Spinal Disorders. Dr. Nahed's clinic interest are in tumors of the eloquent cortex requiring awake surgery, language and motor mapping, and subcortical stimulation. Born in New York, Dr. Nahed attended UCLA where he majored in Neuroscience, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and with the department's Highest Honors. He attended the Yale School of Medicine where he was awarded the Doris Duke Clinical Research Fellowship and graduated with honors. Dr. Nahed completed his internship and neurosurgery residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital; where Dr. Nahed also completed a postdoctoral fellowship with Drs. Daniel Haber and Shyamala Maheswaran in the MGH Cancer Center. Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he was not born in Iran, he has never held Iranian citizenship, he has never worked or lived in Iran, and he has never even been to Iran. He's a natural-born U.S. citizen from New York who has lived, attended school, and worked in the United States his whole life\n\nquestion: Where did Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry first meet?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse", "usage": 1130}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Mohammad Javad Zarif's Diplomatic Career and Relationships\n\nevidence: . More important, he is not close friends with either Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif or Zarif's son: he doesn't know either of them, and Zarif's son was not the best man at his wedding (nor, as some accounts report, was Zarif's son his college roommate). Vanessa Kerry herself verified to us that Zarif's son was not at her wedding: The small piece of information here that is true is that Brian Nahed's parents were themselves born in Iran. However, they permanently left that country to immigrate to the U.S. forty years ago, well before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and now live in Los Angeles (where Brian's father also works as a physician). As for the rest of the \"facts\" presented in the Westian article, they were nothing more than a collection of supposition and innuendo, such as the claim that John Kerry \"only revealed his daughter's marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of State\" in 2013. By the article's own admission, that marriage had been very publicly covered in wedding announcement published by the New York Times in 2009, one which used the full \"Persianized\" versions of Brian's parents' names \u2014 something hardly suggestive of the notion that the media were conspiring to cover up revelation of their ancestry: The bride, who is a stepdaughter of Teresa Heinz Kerry and Richard J. Charlesworth, and the bridegroom, a son of Nooshin P. Nahed and Dr. Reza M. Nahed of Los Angeles, were married Saturday evening at Brandegee House, a Tuscan-style villa in Boston. The Right Rev. M. Thomas Shaw, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, officiated. Dr. Kerry and Dr. Nahed, both 32, are residents at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She is in her third year of a residency in internal medicine; he is in his fifth year of a residency in neurological surgery. More absurdly, the article's statement that \"even the official  wedding announcement carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)'s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college years\" was deliberately misleading and specious, as that wedding announcement also made no mention of the bride's birthplace and started her biography from her college years (which is in fact quite common in wedding announcements, especially those of people who have achieved significant accomplishments in adulthood). And it makes no logical sense whatsoever that anyone attempting to hide Brian Nahed's familial connection to Iran would \"carefully avoid any reference\" to his \"foreign\" birthplace of New York. Finally, the unsourced statement that \"Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise.\" is (even if true) little more than out-of-context innuendo intended to suggest some kind of close pre-negotiation friendship between the two figures without providing any actual evidence of it. Both men have an extensive history of political and diplomatic service to their countries over the last thirty years: Mohammad Javad Zarif lived in and was educated (up to the PhD level) in the United States, served as a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations (a position in which he met with a number of Washington politicians), has been a headline speaker at foreign policy conferences in the U.S. (attended by prominent Washington politicians), and has been Iran's minister of foreign affairs since 2013, while John Kerry served several terms in the U.S. Senate, was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, chaired the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, and has been U.S. Secretary of State since 2013. It's hardly a \"surprise\" to anyone the least bit familiar with the political world that two men who have long held high positions in their countries' national governments and been closely involved with foreign affairs might have crossed paths at some point prior to their first negotiation as their countries' official representatives.

The taped conversation was connected to an oral history project, titled \"In the Islamic Republic, the military field rules,\" that documents the work of then-president Hassan Rouhani and his government. The tape was obtained by the London-based news channel Iran International and publicized by The New York Times. Zarif did not dispute the authenticity of the leaked tape, but questioned the motive. Iran International noted that Zarif's claim was \"not very credible.\" Although the tape has not been authenticated, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman did not deny its validity, and critics of Zarif were calling for his resignation, saying that \"he had threatened Iran\u2019s national security by revealing to the world the country\u2019s inner politics\". Iran's president Hassan Rouhani ordered an investigation to identify who leaked the tape. He stated that it was \"stolen for clear reasons\". On May 2, 2021, in an Instagram post, Zarif apologized for the remarks that he made against Soleimani. In the tape, Zarif said former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told him that Israel attacked Iranian assets in Syria \"at least 200 times.\" Zarif said that he was astonished by the admission. Kerry was not recorded speaking on the tape, and the date of the recording is unknown. A posting on Iran International's website indicated that Zarif was taken aback, that it was not the IRGC who informed him about the Israeli strikes against Iran, but Kerry. NBC reported that the leaked tape \"inflamed a debate raging in Iran over the nuclear deal\" with upcoming presidential elections. Also, its effects in the US where \"Republican opponents of nuclear diplomacy with Iran have seized on Zarif's account\". On September 27, 2013, Kerry met with Zarif during the P5+1 and Iran summit, which eventually led to the JCPOA nuclear agreement. It was the highest-level direct contact between the United States and Iran in the last six years, and it made Kerry the first U.S. Secretary of State to have met with his Iranian counterpart since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. In April 2021, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State Ned Price stated in a press briefing that he couldn't confirm the accuracy or authenticity of the Zarif audiotape or its claims, but implied that Kerry would not have likely been disclosing confidential information if it occurred. He stated that prior press reporting of Israeli attacks on Syria would have made the suspected call contents already part of the public record, making Kerry's alleged disclosures to Zarif as not confidential. As CNN noted, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed in July 2017 that Israeli airstrikes had targeted Iranian-backed Hezbollah-bound convoys in Syria \"dozens of times\", and in August 2017, Israeli Air Force chief Maj. Gen. Amir Eshel confirmed that Israel had attacked convoys bringing arms to Hezbollah several times over the past five years. In 2018, Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz stated that \"in the last two years Israel has taken military action  more than 200 times within Syria itself.\" However, it is unclear whether Kerry allegedly revealed the Israeli operations to Zarif before or after Israel itself publicly reported them in 2018. In May 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported that then-President Donald Trump said that Kerry \u201cshould be prosecuted\u201d for meeting privately with Iranian officials. Nineteen Republican senators signed a letter asking President Joe Biden to investigate the Zarif claim, writing: \"We write to convey our grave concerns over U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry\u2019s position as a member of your administration's National Security Council and his record \u2013 both past and present \u2013 of potentially working with America\u2019s adversaries against our national security interests and those of our allies. We ask you to investigate recent allegations that Secretary Kerry revealed sensitive information to the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, and if true, call for his removal from your national security team.\" Three Republican representatives, Ann Wagner, Andy Barr, and Lee Zeldin, sent a letter to Diana Shaw, the State Department's acting inspector general, asking for a full investigation into Zarif's claims. In the letter they wrote, \u201cGiven the gravity of the security threat Iran poses to U.S. and Israeli interests, we respectfully ask that you fully investigate these allegations...Iran is a serious threat to Israel, a bulwark of democracy and stability in the Middle East. It is in our national security interest to stand by our strategic ally - not sell it out to our adversaries\u201d. The letter also requested that Shaw make a determination if Kerry should have his security clearance revoked. The lawmakers inquired what role Kerry had in formulating the Biden administration's policy on re-entering the JCPOA. They also questioned whether the state department knew of any Iranian proxy \u201cfollow-on attacks\u201d made against Israel after Kerry allegedly met with Zarif\n\nquestion: Where did Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry first meet?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "During the P5+1 and Iran summit.", "usage": 1127}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In a tweet, Kerry denied Zarif's account, writing: \u201cI can tell you that this story and these allegations are unequivocally false. This never happened \u2014 either when I was Secretary of State or since.\u201d Starting on April 27, 2021, some Republicans suggested that Kerry should resign from the Biden administration's National Security Council or were highly critical of Kerry's alleged disclosures. Other Republicans expressed uncertainty about the tape's veracity. In the tape, Zarif spoke about his relationship with Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by a United States drone strike in 2020. Zarif said that \"by assassinating  in Iraq, the United States delivered a major blow to Iran, more damaging than if it had wiped out an entire city in an attack\".\n\nquestion: Where did Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry first meet?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 318}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry married Dr. Brian Vala Nahed in 2009. The couple met as resident doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Nahed was born in New York. According to a New York Times announcement, the bridegroom graduated magna cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, and received his medical degree cum laude from Yale. His father, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine and critical-care physician, is the chief of staff at Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills, Calif. He also runs a private practice there, which is managed by the bridegroom\u2019s mother. Who is the Iranian in question? Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, and one of the principal negotiators in nuclear talks with the U.S. The stories allege that Zarif was the best man at Kerry\u2019s wedding, but there is no proof that this is true. The rumour started on Allen B. West\u2019s \u2013 a former one-term congressman and conservative pundit \u2013 website in July 2015: \u201cSecretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry\u2019s daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif\u2019s son.\u201d An Iranian news agency called the report a \u201cnews fabrication\u201d and said Zarif\u2019s son wasn\u2019t at the wedding. According to the report: \u201cOfficials at the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday strongly rejected some US media reports alleging that Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif\u2019s son had attended the wedding ceremony of Vanessa Kerry, the daughter of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The foreign ministry\u2019s denial came after several American websites claimed in the last few days that Zarif\u2019s son, Mehdi Zarif, had not only attended the wedding party of Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry and her Iranian American husband doctor Brian Vala Nahed, but also been Vala Nahed\u2019s best man. The report seems to have appeared on the US media not to hurt the Iranian foreign minister, but to damage Kerry\u2019s credit and reputation as the Republicans and the Israeli lobbies have started massive propaganda to torpedo a recent nuclear deal struck between the six world powers and Iran. Only the powerful Israeli lobby group, AIPAC, has declared a 20 million dollar fund for the purpose. And the Vanessa-Brian story only seems to be the beginning.\u201d The conclusion: Not only is Brian Nahed not Iranian, he wasn\u2019t born in Iran, has never held Iranian citizenship, and has never even been to Iran. He is a natural-born US citizen who has lived, attended school, and worked in the US his whole life. Furthermore, he is not close friends with either Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif or Zarif\u2019s son: he doesn\u2019t know either of them, and Zarif\u2019s son was not the best man at his wedding (nor, as some accounts report, was Zarif\u2019s son his college roommate).

He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran \u2013 if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero\u2019s welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \u201cLong live Zarif,\u201d crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \u201cpolished\u201d and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \u201cjovial.\u201d An Internet search for \u201cMohammad Javad Zarif\u201d and \u201cjovial\u201d yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: Iran/P5+1 Statement: \"The EU will TERMINATE the implementation of ALL nuclear-related economic and financial sanctions\". How about this? In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \u201cHappy Rosh Hashanah,\u201d referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \u201cThanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran\u2019s Holocaust denial, sir.\u201d And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \u201cIran never denied it,\u201d Zarif tweeted back. \u201cThe man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\u201d The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad\u2019s successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \u201cdue to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\u201d That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master\u2019s in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \u201cborn to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\u201d Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. Committed to start drafting the comprehensive nuclear deal immediately. All will be served by a serious agreement based on mutual respect. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif\u2019s name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com \u2013 which cites Zarif\u2019s memoirs, titled \u201cMr. Ambassador\u201d \u2013 was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland. \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network\n\nquestion: Where did Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry first meet?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "In the United States.", "usage": 1090}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was the foreign minister of Iran from 2013 until 2021 in the government of Hassan Rouhani. During his tenure as foreign minister, he led the Iranian negotiation with P5+1 countries which produced the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on 14 July 2015, lifting the economic sanctions against Iran on 16 January 2016. On 25 February 2019, Zarif resigned from his post as foreign minister. His resignation was rejected by Ali Khamenei and he continued as foreign minister. Before assuming his current position, he held various significant diplomatic and cabinet posts. He is a visiting professor at the School of International Relations and University of Tehran, teaching diplomacy and international organizations. He was the Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations from 2002 to 2007. He served as an advisor and senior advisor to the Foreign Minister, Deputy Foreign Minister in Legal and International affairs, member of the UN Eminent Persons Group on Dialogue Among Civilizations, Head of the UN Disarmament Commission in New York, and Vice President for International Affairs of the Islamic Azad University. Zarif was born in Tehran around 1960, although other sources have given the year of birth as 1959 and 1961. According to The New Republic, Zarif was born to an \"affluent, religiously devout and politically conservative merchant family in Tehran\". His father was one of the most well-known businessmen of Isfahan, and his mother Efat Kashani (d. 2013) was the daughter of one of the most famous businessmen of Tehran. He was educated at the Alavi School, a private religious institution. Zarif was shielded from TV, radio, and newspapers by his parents as a youth. There was only an alarm clock that played the Athan during prayers. Instead, he became exposed to revolutionary ideas by reading the books of Ali Shariati and Samad Behrangi. At age 17, he left Iran for the United States. Zarif attended Drew College Preparatory School, a private college-preparatory high school located in San Francisco, California. He went on to study at San Francisco State University, from which he gained a B.A. in 1981 and M.A. in 1982, both in international relations. Following this, Zarif continued his studies at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, University of Denver, from which he obtained a second M.A. in international relations in 1984 and a Ph.D. in international law and policy in 1988. His thesis was titled \"Self-Defense in International Law and Policy.\" Tom Rowe, a professor at the graduate school who led the committee that oversaw Zarif's dissertation, said: \"He was among the very best students that I've ever taught.\" Ved Nanda, who taught and was on Zarif's dissertation committee, recalled: \" good in the classroom. At that time... I thought he'd play an important part in his country's life.\" Zarif was appointed a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations in May 1982 \u2013 largely due to his English-speaking ability and relationships in America, rather than formal diplomatic training. As a junior diplomat Zarif was involved in negotiations to win the release of U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian gunmen in Lebanon, according to the memoirs of former United Nations envoy Giandomenico Picco. Even though the United States did not make a promised reciprocal goodwill gesture at the time, Zarif remained committed to improving ties. In 2000, Zarif served as chairman of the Asian preparatory meeting of the World Conference on Racism and as the chairman of the United Nations Disarmament Commission. Zarif was also professor of international law at the University of Tehran. He served as the vice president of Islamic Azad University in charge of foreign affairs from 2010 to 2012 under Abdollah Jasbi. He has served on the board of editors of a number of scholarly journals, including the Iranian Journal of International Affairs and Iranian Foreign Policy, and has written extensively on disarmament, human rights, international law, and regional conflicts. Zarif served as Iran's representative at the United Nations from 2002 to 2007. He was closely linked with developing the so-called \"Grand Bargain,\" a plan to resolve outstanding issues between the U.S. and Iran in 2003. Zarif, during his time at the UN, held private meetings with a number of Washington politicians, including the then-Senators Joseph Biden and Chuck Hagel. He resigned from office on 6 July 2007. He was succeeded by Mohammad Khazaee in the post. In 2007, Zarif was a headline speaker at an American Iranian Council conference in New Brunswick, New Jersey including Chuck Hagel, Dennis Kucinich, Nicholas Kristof,\n\nquestion: Where did Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry first meet?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1153}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

On 23 July 2013, it was reported that Zarif was Rouhani's choice for minister of foreign affairs. This was not confirmed by the president-elect's office until 4 August when Rouhani officially nominated Zarif for the position to the Iranian Parliament. He was confirmed by the parliament with 232 votes, replacing Ali Akbar Salehi in the position. Zarif welcomed the first visit by a foreign leader to Iran since Rouhani assumed the presidency ten days after his approval as Foreign Minister with the arrival of Oman's sultan, Qaboos bin Said Al Said. Stories spread that there was a secret agenda to his meetings with Iranian officials, involving claims that he came to convey messages from the United States and then to relay Iran's response to White House officials. On 5 September 2013, in an exchange prompted by his Rosh Hashanah greeting on Twitter, Zarif said that Iran does not deny the Holocaust, distancing the government from the often belligerent stances by former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Genuineness of Zarif's tweeting in English was confirmed by CNN's Christiane Amanpour. On 27 September 2013, he met with United States Secretary of State John Kerry during P5+1 and Iran summit. It was the highest-level direct contact between the United States and Iran in the last six years. After the meeting, Kerry said that \"We had a constructive meeting, and I think all of us were pleased that Foreign Minister Zarif came and made a presentation to us, which was very different in tone and very different in the vision that he held out with respect to possibilities of the future.\" After the breakup of talks on 12 November, Zarif rejected Kerry's claim that Iran had been unable to accept the deal \"at that particular moment\". He said \"no amount of spinning\" could change what had happened in Geneva, but it could \"further erode confidence\". Zarif appeared to blame France for \"gutting over half\" of a US draft deal. Representatives from Iran and the so-called P5+1 \u2013 met again on 20 November. Talks between senior American, Iranian and European diplomats in October 2014 produced no breakthrough agreement on curbing Iran's nuclear program, but officials said they still aimed to reach a deal by the 24 November deadline. A senior State Department official characterized each step of progress in the talks as \"chipping away\" at complex, technical differences, with virtually every sentence requiring an appendix of further explanation. \"We continue to make progress, but there is still a substantial amount of work to be done,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the difficult and secretive negotiations. Zarif and Kerry conferred, ahead of a fresh round of negotiations between Iran and six world powers in Geneva, on settling their 12-year standoff over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Lower-level negotiators on both sides met at the same venue on 15 January 2015 to iron out technical details ahead of negotiations 3 days later between Iran and the \"P5+1\" powers \u2013 the US, France, Germany, Russia, China and Britain. Speaking at a Tehran news conference, Zarif said the purpose of the talks with Kerry \"is to see if we can speed up and push the negotiations forward\". In February, Zarif said that Iran did not favor another extension of the talks on limiting its nuclear program and expected economic sanctions to be quickly lifted if an accord was reached. At a security conference in Munich, he said \"Sanctions are a liability; you need to get rid of them if you want a solution.\" Of the long effort to forge an agreement, he said \"This is the opportunity to do it, and we need to seize this opportunity. It may not be repeated.\" The nuclear talks have already been extended twice and face a late March deadline for working out the main outlines of an accord. The deadline for a detailed agreement is the end of June. Based on the Iran nuclear deal framework, which was declared on 2 April, Iran agreed to accept significant restrictions on its nuclear program for at least a decade and submit to international inspections under a framework deal. In return, international sanctions would be lifted; whether in phases or all at once still needed to be worked out. On 21 November it was reported by Iranian negotiators that progress was being made in talks in Geneva with world powers, expressing hope to bridge differences and sign an elusive deal over Tehran's nuclear drive. In statements carried by Iranian media after a one-hour meeting with Baroness Ashton, Zarif said \"Differences of opinion remain and we are negotiating over them. God willing we will reach a result.\" Three days later, the Geneva interim agreement, officially titled the Joint Plan of Action, was signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in Geneva, Switzerland. It consisted of a short-term freeze of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries worked toward a long-term agreement.

He responded, \"We do not jail people for their opinions\" Zarif condemned U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, saying the United States should be held \"accountable for crimes against humanity\". On 11 February 2019, Zarif met with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Nasrallah thanked Zarif for Iran's support of Hezbollah's fight against 'Zionist aggression', and Zarif affirmed his country's \"firm stance that supports Lebanon and its state, people and resistance\". In an interview conducted by CBS News on 25 April 2019, Zarif said that he was the one who proposed Iran's prisoner swap proposal to the U.S. government in October 2018, the proposal having been unanswered by the U.S. side up until that time. He added that the U.S. government must prove its seriousness before any negotiations. Zarif condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria viewing it as a violation of Syria's sovereignty. However regarding the US withdrawal from Syria Zarif commented saying the US was an \"irrelevant occupier in Syria\", and said that Iran would be willing to mediate tensions between Syria and Turkey. Zarif called the peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates a betrayal against Arab and non-Arab countries in the Middle East. Zarif stepped down from his post on 25 February 2019, announcing his resignation on Instagram. After greetings in honor of Iranian Women's and Mothers' day, he wrote I am apologising  you (wholeheartedly) for my (inability to continue my service and any) shortcomings in the past years during my time as foreign minister... I thank the Iranian nation and officials. Zarif did not elaborate or provide any further explanation. An aide said that one of the reasons for Zarif's resignation was anger over his exclusion that day from meetings with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who was visiting Tehran. Rouhani rejected Zarif's resignation two days later. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force, also rejected Zarif's resignation, with Soleimani remarking that Zarif is the \"main person in charge of foreign policy.\" In July 2019 the United States imposed sanctions on Zarif, and he was identified by the US as an \"illegitimate spokesperson for Iran\". In response, a spokesman for European Union diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini stated, \"We regret this decision.\" On 25 April 2021, The New York Times published content from a leaked audiotape of a three-hour taped conversation between economist Saeed Laylaz and Zarif. The taped conversation was connected to an oral history project, \"In the Islamic Republic the military field rules,\" that documents the work of Iran's current administration. The tape was obtained by the London-based news channel Iran International. In the tape, which the Times refers to as \"extraordinary\" moments, Zarif criticizes Qasem Soleimani and Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and alleges that former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told him that Israel attacked Iranian assets in Syria \"at least 200 times.\" Although the tape has not been authenticated, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman did not deny its validity. Zarif is married and has a daughter who is an interior decorator and a son who is a marketing consultant, both of whom were born in the United States. He met his wife in summer 1979 through his sister. They married in Iran but moved to New York within several weeks in the midst of the Iranian revolution. In addition to his native Persian, he is also fluent in English. Zarif has gained a domestic reputation and popularity among the people. His \"Never threaten an Iranian!\" remark, during the heated nuclear negotiations, gained attention from global news agencies. According to a poll conducted by Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC (iPOS) in March 2016, Zarif was the most popular political figure in Iran with 76% approval and 7% disapproval ratings.\n\nquestion: Where did Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry first meet?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 951}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif claimed in recently leaked audio that John Kerry, when he was serving as Secretary of State during the Obama administration, informed him of more than 200 Israeli operations in Syria. Kerry has previously been accused of colluding with Iranian leaders to undermine the Trump administration. Kerry is now a part of the Biden administration and has a seat on the National Security Council as the special presidential envoy for climate. Kerry shocked Zarif by revealing that Israel had attacked Iranian targets in Syria more than 200 times, according to leaked audio obtained by The New York Times and other outlets. Zarif also spoke frankly about his limited power compared to Ayatollah Ali Khameini and the blow the U.S. dealt to Iran by killing Gen. Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. IRAN\u2019S TOP DIPLOMAT, IN LEAKED RECORDING, OFFERS BLUNT COMMENTS ABOUT RUSSIA, SOLEIMANI Kerry faced criticism on Monday over Zarif's claim. \"John Kerry was ratting out Israeli covert operations in Syria directly to the Iranian foreign minister. Let that sink in. Wow,\" Noah Pollak of the foreign policy-focused Democratic Alliance Group wrote on Twitter. Former special advisor for Iran at the State Department Gabriel Noronha weighed in on Zarif's lasting political career, despite his differences with others in Iranian governnment. \"The main reason Zarif has survived as Foreign Minister for 8 years in Iran\u2019s cutthroat political environment is that he serves as the \u2018reasonable\u2019 storefront to the world, protecting the more empowered radical elements of the regime from Western and press scrutiny,\" Noronha said in a statement.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) \"Most of the time, Zarif\u2019s Foreign Ministry is relegated to the job of the marketing and PR team, justifying and defending the policy choices of the IRGC and Supreme Leader Khamenei abroad,\" he continued. \"I think the leak was likely instigated by regime insiders who have long hated Zarif and tried to oust him \u2014 they oppose current efforts to rejoin the JCPOA and also want to bolster domestic opposition to President Rouhani and his allies running for office in June.\" The release of the comments by Zarif set off a firestorm within Iran, where officials carefully mind their words amid a cutthroat political environment that includes the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, ultimately overseen by the country's supreme leader. Zarif has been suggested as a possible candidate for Iran's June 18 presidential election as well. In this September file photo, Secretary of State John Kerry, left, meets with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at United Nations headquarters. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) Outside of Iran, Zarif's comments could also affect talks in Vienna aimed at finding a way for Tehran and the U.S. to both come into compliance with Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Already, sabotage targeted Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz during the talks as Tehran has begun enriching a small amount of uranium up to 60% purity, which edges the country closer to weapons-grade levels. After the leak became public, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh did not dispute the tape's authenticity. He told journalists on Monday that the recording represented just a portion of a seven-hour interview Zarif gave to a well-known economist that was to be held for posterity by a think tank associated with the Iranian presidency. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Khatibzadeh called the release of the recording \"illegal\" and described it as \"selectively\" edited, though he and others did not offer opinions on how it became public. Zarif, visiting Iraq on Monday after a trip to Qatar, took no questions from journalists after giving a brief statement in Baghdad.

In August, Iran\u2019s new president, Ebrahim Raisi, hailed the U.S. withdrawal as \u201can opportunity to restore life, security and durable peace.\u201d But Iran also appeared to be caught off-guard by the Taliban\u2019s sweeping takeover and the rapid collapse of the Afghan army. Iran \u201cis concerned over the escalating violence in Afghanistan, and in light of the Taliban taking control of Herat, calls for guarantees of complete safety for its diplomatic missions and the lives of its staff,\u201d Foreign Ministry Spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh tweeted on August 13. Iran has a strategic interest in Afghanistan, regardless of who is in power. The chaotic aftermath of the Taliban\u2019s takeover held the potential to undermine Tehran\u2019s long-term concerns, including stemming the flow of migrants and refugees, containing narcotics trafficking, maintaining cross-border trade, sharing water resources, ensuring the safety of the Shiite minority, and mitigating the threat from ISIS-Khorasan. Refugees and migrants: Iran has absorbed millions of refugees since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Afghans have also historically sought seasonal work in Iran. Remittance payments, primarily from undocumented Afghan men, have long been an important part of Afghanistan\u2019s cash-strapped economy. As of 2020, Iran hosted some 950,000 documented Afghan refugees and at least 2 million more undocumented Afghans. But Iran has repeatedly tried to expel undocumented Afghans. In the first seven months of 2021, Iran deported more than 360,000 Afghans, according to the U.N. migration agency. Narcotics trafficking: Iran has blamed the Afghan government and its Western allies for failing to crack down on opium production and drug smuggling. Since 1998, Afghanistan has been the world\u2019s top opiate producer. It supplies some 80 percent of the world\u2019s opium, much of which is smuggled to Iran and on to Europe. Between 1979 and 2014, Iran claims to have lost some 4,000 security forces fighting heavily armed drug traffickers along its eastern border. Drug use is a growing domestic problem for Iran too. As of 2020, some 2.8 million Iranians were regular drug users in a population of 84 million. Another 1.6 million were recreational users. Cross-border trade: Since 2001, Iran has sought to increase exports to landlocked Afghanistan. Iran also views Afghanistan as a transportation route to expand economic ties with Central and South Asian countries. In 2017, Iran surpassed Pakistan as Afghanistan\u2019s top trade partner. Trade has largely been one-way. In 2019, Iranian exports\u2014including electricity, oil, cement, machinery, metal products, pharmaceuticals, wheat, fabrics and edible oils\u2014totaled $1.24 billion. But Afghan exports to Iran \u2013including fruit, nuts, carpets, cotton and wool \u2013 amounted to only $15 million. Between March and June 2021, 11 percent of Iran\u2019s non-oil exports went to Afghanistan. Water resources: For decades, Iran and Afghanistan have disputed how to share water resources. The Helmand River flows from the mountains of the Hindu Kush through Afghanistan into southeastern Iran, where it is critical for agriculture, fishing and human consumption. The problem in modern times dates to the 1940s and 1950s, when Afghanistan built two dams\u2014the Kajaki and the Grishk\u2014on the Helmand River that could curtail water flow into Iran. In 1973, the two countries signed a treaty on sharing water resources, which focused heavily on distribution of water from Helmand River, but the accord was neither ratified nor implemented. Subsequent Afghan governments, including the Taliban, built, repaired or upgraded dams on the Helmand. From 1998 to 2001, the Taliban closed the sluices of the Kajaki Dam, cutting off water to Iran during a drought. In 2021, Afghanistan inaugurated another dam, the Kamal Khan, on the Helmand. Amnesty International says Taliban fighters recently tortured and killed members of an ethnic minority in Afghanistan, fueling fears that they will again impose a brutal rule. https://t.co/tSvLOITUK4 The Shiite minority: Iran has long supported the Hazaras, a historically oppressed ethnic minority who make up between 10 percent and 20 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s population. Most Hazaras, like most Iranians, are Shiite. They also speak a dialect of Persian. When the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan, it carried out waves of mass killings of Hazaras in 1998, 2000 and 2001. After the Taliban fell, Iran cultivated influence among the Hazaras by funding cultural and religious activities as well as local media. In 2013, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) began recruiting Hazaras to fight in the new Fat\n\nquestion: Where did Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry first meet?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1137}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Over the next four years, the IRGC deployed to Syria up to 50,000 Afghans, mostly refugees who were living in Iran. The Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K): Iran has been deeply concerned about the Afghan branch of the Islamic State that emerged in 2015. ISIS-K considers Shiites apostates and has targeted them in Afghanistan. In 2020, ISIS-K gunmen allegedly killed 16 people, including infants, at a maternity hospital in a mostly Hazara neighborhood in Kabul. In December 2020, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested that the Afghan government consider regrouping Fatemiyoun fighters for the fight against ISIS-K. Iran has long supported efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. Tehran was a key player during the Bonn talks, the international diplomacy to form a new government after the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance toppled the Taliban government in 2001. The Iranian delegation, headed by then-Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, made two particularly important contributions, according to James Dobbins, the U.S. envoy. First, Iranian diplomats suggested that the Bonn agreement require the new Afghan government to commit to holding democratic elections and fighting terrorism, items that were omitted in the initial draft. Second, Zarif persuaded the Northern Alliance to give up several ministries, paving the way for the formation of Hamid Karzai\u2019s government. Iran has also invested heavily in the economic development of its eastern neighbor, the seventh poorest country in the world. At the 2002 Afghanistan Recovery and Reconstruction Conference in Tokyo, Iran pledged $560 million over five years. Iran pledged another $100 million at the 2006 London Conference. Iran helped construct roads, railways, schools, energy and water infrastructure, especially in central and northern Afghanistan. In 2011, Iran announced that it had spent $600 million on infrastructure alone. Iran funded construction of the first railway link between the two countries, a 90-mile (140 kilometer) line from Khaf in northeastern Iran to Ghoryan in western Afghanistan. The line, inaugurated in 2020, is designed to eventually extend another 53 miles to Herat, Afghanistan\u2019s third largest city. Much of Iran\u2019s investment has been focused in and around Herat. For centuries, the city has been in Iran\u2019s cultural sphere of influence. It was ruled by the Iranian Safavid dynasty from 1507 to 1716. The Iranian Qajar dynasty only relinquished its claim to Herat after losing to the British in the Anglo-Persian war of 1856-57. Iran has reprised its mediator role since Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced a road map for potential peace talks with the Taliban in November 2018. On December 26, 2018, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), visited Kabul to meet with Afghan officials. He announced that Iran had been holding talks with the Taliban in coordination with the Afghan government. Four days later, a Taliban delegation visited Tehran for talks. \u201cSince the Islamic Republic of Iran is a powerful neighbor of Afghanistan, we should discuss the future of our country with Tehran in order to take positive steps towards strengthening friendship and peace on both sides,\u201d Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told the Iranian Labour News Agency in January 2019. Iran hosted more Taliban delegations in September 2019, November 2019, January 2021 and July 2021. Iran, a predominantly Shiite country, opposed the Taliban, a Sunni movement far more rigid in its strict application of Islamic law, when it ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. In 1998, tensions between Iran and the Taliban almost escalated into war after eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist were killed by Taliban militants in northern Mazar-i-Sharif. When the Iranian nationals went missing, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the \u201cworthless and lowly\u201d Taliban had \u201cno understanding of Islam or politics.\u201d But since at least 2007, the Islamic Republic has tried to navigate a policy that includes outreach to both the elected Afghan government and the Taliban. Iran covertly armed, trained and funded the Taliban while engaging with Kabul. Tehran provided the Taliban with small arms, explosives, mortars, RPGs, heavy machine guns, and rockets, according to the Pentagon. In 2015, a Taliban delegation led by Muhammad Tayyab Agha, the head of the Taliban\u2019s political office in Qatar, visited Tehran for talks on Afghanistan and regional issues. The Taliban acknowledged that its officials had visited Iran before. In 2016, Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour secretly visited Iran for talks; he was killed in a U.S. drone strike as he returned to Pakistan. In 2019, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessed that Tehran did not want to return the Taliban to power but aimed to \u201cmaintain influence with the group as a hedge in the event that the Taliban gains a role in a\n\nquestion: Where did Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry first meet?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1143}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Zarif subsequently tweeted that the meeting had been \u201ccordial\u201d and promised Iran would stand with Afghans on their road to peace. After further talks on July 8, the two sides released a joint statement condemning attacks on civilians and public institutions. They agreed that \u201cwar is not the solution to the Afghanistan problem.\u201d Iran has deployed its 65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade (NOHED) in Taibad along the Afghan border amid Taliban's seizure of border crossings pic.twitter.com/9t9WfcdbCx July 9: The Taliban seized Islam Qala, a major border crossing between Iran and Afghanistan. The crossing had reportedly generated some $20 million in monthly revenue for the Afghan government. Videos circulated of Taliban fighters removing the Afghan flag from the border crossing. July 15-16: Rasoul Mousavi, the head of the west Asia department in Iran\u2019s foreign ministry, visited Kabul for talks with senior Afghan government officials, including Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation. \u201cIran supports putting an end to the situation in Afghanistan and resolving the crisis through dialogue,\u201d Mousavi told Abdullah. \u201cOpportunities pass like clouds. The opportunity of peace must be taken today, not tomorrow, as it might be late,\u201d Mousavi tweeted on his way back to Iran on July 17. Aug. 1: Iran\u2019s embassy in Kabul urged Iranians outside of the capital to leave Afghanistan. \u201cIt is recommended to the nationals of the Islamic Republic of Iran who live or do business in Afghan districts and cities other than the city of Kabul to immediately leave the Afghan territory,\u201d the embassy said in a statement following reports of Taliban attacks on an airport in Kandahar.

They agreed that intra-Afghan talks were the best way to stem the violence. \u201cThe international community must take an unequivocal stance in support of the political settlement for the crisis in Afghanistan and also condemn violence and its consequences,\u201d Zarif said. He also blamed foreign powers for the chaos in Afghanistan. Arnault said that Iran and other countries in the region could play a key role in supporting the peace process. Iran\u2019s special envoy for Afghanistan, Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, reiterated Tehran\u2019s support for intra-Afghan talks during a phone call with Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan\u2019s High Council for National Reconciliation. In a video circulated on social media, Iranian border guards refused to hand over Afghan army troops to the Taliban. Aug. 9: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Khatibzadeh said that Iran was in contact with the Taliban regarding border security. \u201cThere have been occasional developments at our borders, but the borders have been calm during this period with the efforts of the border guards and the courageous Army forces, Khatibzadeh said. \u201cWe have tried to send the message that Iran\u2019s borders must remain calm.\u201d Aug. 10: Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar hosted Iran\u2019s special envoy, Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, in Kabul to discuss Tehran\u2019s role in facilitating peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.

West, a former one-term congressman and conservative pundit, published an article asserting that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had hidden a close familial connection to an Iranian official with whom he had negotiated a nuclear deal. According to that article (\"You will NOT BELIEVE who was best man at John Kerry's daughter's wedding\"), John Kerry concealed the information that his son-in-law was Iranian during the U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for his position as secretary of state. Moreover, throughout the negotiations over a deal limiting Iran's development of nuclear weapons, Kerry hid the fact that he was buddy-buddy with Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister whom he negotiated the nuclear deal \u2014 so much so that the best man at the wedding of Kerry's daughter was Zarif's son: You not might be aware that in 2009, the daughter of Secretary of State John Kerry, Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerry's younger daughter by his first wife, married an Iranian-American physician named Dr. Brian (Behrooz) Vala Nahed. Of course you're not aware of it. Brian (Behrooz) Nahed is son of Nooshin and Reza Vala Nahid of Los Angeles. Brian's Persian birth name is \"Behrooz Vala Nahid\" but it is now shortened and Americanized in the media to \"Brian Nahed.\" At the time his engagement to Bradford Kerry, there was rarely any mention of Nahed's Persian/Iranian ancestry, and even the official wedding announcement in the October 2009 issue of New York Times carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)'s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college years. Gosh, I wonder why?? Gee, do you think Secretary Kerry should have recused himself from the negotiations with Iran at the very outset because of his long-standing relationship to his Iranian counter-part, Mohammad Javad Zarif? Let me explain. Zarif is the current minister of foreign affairs in the Rouhani administration and has held various significant diplomatic and cabinet posts since the 1990s. He was Kerry's chief counterpart in the nuclear deal negotiations. Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry's daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif's son. Does this bother anyone at all? Apparently Kerry only revealed his daughter's marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of State. But the subject never came up in his Senate confirmation hearing, either because Kerry never disclosed it, or because his former colleagues were \"too polite\" to bring it up. As Front Page Magazine pointed out several months ago, the nuclear talks with Iran were a tragic farce, choreographed and orchestrated by Iran. And unfortunately, we're going to have to live with the consequences. At least, I hope we live. All of this information was wrong. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerry's daughter from his previous marriage to writer Julia Stimson Thorne (from whom he was divorced in 1988), married Brian Vala Nahed on 10 October 2009. Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he is an American-born U.S. citizen who attended school at UCLA and Yale and is currently a neurosurgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital (where his wife is also a physician specializing in critical care). This information has been plainly available for years in his official workplace biography on the Massachusetts General Hospital web site: Dr. Brian Nahed is a neurosurgeon who specializes in brain tumors (glioblastoma, gliomas, metastatic brain tumors, and meningiomas) as well as Spinal Disorders. Dr. Nahed's clinic interest are in tumors of the eloquent cortex requiring awake surgery, language and motor mapping, and subcortical stimulation. Born in New York, Dr. Nahed attended UCLA where he majored in Neuroscience, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and with the department's Highest Honors. He attended the Yale School of Medicine where he was awarded the Doris Duke Clinical Research Fellowship and graduated with honors. Dr. Nahed completed his internship and neurosurgery residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital; where Dr. Nahed also completed a postdoctoral fellowship with Drs. Daniel Haber and Shyamala Maheswaran in the MGH Cancer Center. Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he was not born in Iran, he has never held Iranian citizenship, he has never worked or lived in Iran, and he has never even been to Iran. He's a natural-born U.S. citizen from New York who has lived, attended school, and worked in the United States his whole life\n\nquestion: How long have Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry known each other?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Over a decade.", "usage": 1123}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

More important, he is not close friends with either Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif or Zarif's son: he doesn't know either of them, and Zarif's son was not the best man at his wedding (nor, as some accounts report, was Zarif's son his college roommate). Vanessa Kerry herself verified to us that Zarif's son was not at her wedding: The small piece of information here that is true is that Brian Nahed's parents were themselves born in Iran. However, they permanently left that country to immigrate to the U.S. forty years ago, well before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and now live in Los Angeles (where Brian's father also works as a physician). As for the rest of the \"facts\" presented in the Westian article, they were nothing more than a collection of supposition and innuendo, such as the claim that John Kerry \"only revealed his daughter's marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of State\" in 2013. By the article's own admission, that marriage had been very publicly covered in wedding announcement published by the New York Times in 2009, one which used the full \"Persianized\" versions of Brian's parents' names \u2014 something hardly suggestive of the notion that the media were conspiring to cover up revelation of their ancestry: The bride, who is a stepdaughter of Teresa Heinz Kerry and Richard J. Charlesworth, and the bridegroom, a son of Nooshin P. Nahed and Dr. Reza M. Nahed of Los Angeles, were married Saturday evening at Brandegee House, a Tuscan-style villa in Boston. The Right Rev. M. Thomas Shaw, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, officiated. Dr. Kerry and Dr. Nahed, both 32, are residents at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She is in her third year of a residency in internal medicine; he is in his fifth year of a residency in neurological surgery. More absurdly, the article's statement that \"even the official  wedding announcement carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)'s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college years\" was deliberately misleading and specious, as that wedding announcement also made no mention of the bride's birthplace and started her biography from her college years (which is in fact quite common in wedding announcements, especially those of people who have achieved significant accomplishments in adulthood). And it makes no logical sense whatsoever that anyone attempting to hide Brian Nahed's familial connection to Iran would \"carefully avoid any reference\" to his \"foreign\" birthplace of New York. Finally, the unsourced statement that \"Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise.\" is (even if true) little more than out-of-context innuendo intended to suggest some kind of close pre-negotiation friendship between the two figures without providing any actual evidence of it. Both men have an extensive history of political and diplomatic service to their countries over the last thirty years: Mohammad Javad Zarif lived in and was educated (up to the PhD level) in the United States, served as a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations (a position in which he met with a number of Washington politicians), has been a headline speaker at foreign policy conferences in the U.S. (attended by prominent Washington politicians), and has been Iran's minister of foreign affairs since 2013, while John Kerry served several terms in the U.S. Senate, was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, chaired the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, and has been U.S. Secretary of State since 2013. It's hardly a \"surprise\" to anyone the least bit familiar with the political world that two men who have long held high positions in their countries' national governments and been closely involved with foreign affairs might have crossed paths at some point prior to their first negotiation as their countries' official representatives.

The taped conversation was connected to an oral history project, titled \"In the Islamic Republic, the military field rules,\" that documents the work of then-president Hassan Rouhani and his government. The tape was obtained by the London-based news channel Iran International and publicized by The New York Times. Zarif did not dispute the authenticity of the leaked tape, but questioned the motive. Iran International noted that Zarif's claim was \"not very credible.\" Although the tape has not been authenticated, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman did not deny its validity, and critics of Zarif were calling for his resignation, saying that \"he had threatened Iran\u2019s national security by revealing to the world the country\u2019s inner politics\". Iran's president Hassan Rouhani ordered an investigation to identify who leaked the tape. He stated that it was \"stolen for clear reasons\". On May 2, 2021, in an Instagram post, Zarif apologized for the remarks that he made against Soleimani. In the tape, Zarif said former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told him that Israel attacked Iranian assets in Syria \"at least 200 times.\" Zarif said that he was astonished by the admission. Kerry was not recorded speaking on the tape, and the date of the recording is unknown. A posting on Iran International's website indicated that Zarif was taken aback, that it was not the IRGC who informed him about the Israeli strikes against Iran, but Kerry. NBC reported that the leaked tape \"inflamed a debate raging in Iran over the nuclear deal\" with upcoming presidential elections. Also, its effects in the US where \"Republican opponents of nuclear diplomacy with Iran have seized on Zarif's account\". On September 27, 2013, Kerry met with Zarif during the P5+1 and Iran summit, which eventually led to the JCPOA nuclear agreement. It was the highest-level direct contact between the United States and Iran in the last six years, and it made Kerry the first U.S. Secretary of State to have met with his Iranian counterpart since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. In April 2021, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State Ned Price stated in a press briefing that he couldn't confirm the accuracy or authenticity of the Zarif audiotape or its claims, but implied that Kerry would not have likely been disclosing confidential information if it occurred. He stated that prior press reporting of Israeli attacks on Syria would have made the suspected call contents already part of the public record, making Kerry's alleged disclosures to Zarif as not confidential. As CNN noted, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed in July 2017 that Israeli airstrikes had targeted Iranian-backed Hezbollah-bound convoys in Syria \"dozens of times\", and in August 2017, Israeli Air Force chief Maj. Gen. Amir Eshel confirmed that Israel had attacked convoys bringing arms to Hezbollah several times over the past five years. In 2018, Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz stated that \"in the last two years Israel has taken military action  more than 200 times within Syria itself.\" However, it is unclear whether Kerry allegedly revealed the Israeli operations to Zarif before or after Israel itself publicly reported them in 2018. In May 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported that then-President Donald Trump said that Kerry \u201cshould be prosecuted\u201d for meeting privately with Iranian officials. Nineteen Republican senators signed a letter asking President Joe Biden to investigate the Zarif claim, writing: \"We write to convey our grave concerns over U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry\u2019s position as a member of your administration's National Security Council and his record \u2013 both past and present \u2013 of potentially working with America\u2019s adversaries against our national security interests and those of our allies. We ask you to investigate recent allegations that Secretary Kerry revealed sensitive information to the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, and if true, call for his removal from your national security team.\" Three Republican representatives, Ann Wagner, Andy Barr, and Lee Zeldin, sent a letter to Diana Shaw, the State Department's acting inspector general, asking for a full investigation into Zarif's claims. In the letter they wrote, \u201cGiven the gravity of the security threat Iran poses to U.S. and Israeli interests, we respectfully ask that you fully investigate these allegations...Iran is a serious threat to Israel, a bulwark of democracy and stability in the Middle East. It is in our national security interest to stand by our strategic ally - not sell it out to our adversaries\u201d. The letter also requested that Shaw make a determination if Kerry should have his security clearance revoked. The lawmakers inquired what role Kerry had in formulating the Biden administration's policy on re-entering the JCPOA. They also questioned whether the state department knew of any Iranian proxy \u201cfollow-on attacks\u201d made against Israel after Kerry allegedly met with Zarif\n\nquestion: How long have Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry known each other?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1121}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In May 2021, Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee requested documents from the White House regarding Kerry's security clearance. In the letter, signed by all but three Republicans on the panel, they questioned \"Kerry\u2019s fitness to serve in his current role with the National Security Council\" and whether he should maintain a security clearance. In a tweet, Kerry denied Zarif's account, writing: \u201cI can tell you that this story and these allegations are unequivocally false. This never happened \u2014 either when I was Secretary of State or since.\u201d Starting on April 27, 2021, some Republicans suggested that Kerry should resign from the Biden administration's National Security Council or were highly critical of Kerry's alleged disclosures. Other Republicans expressed uncertainty about the tape's veracity. In the tape, Zarif spoke about his relationship with Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by a United States drone strike in 2020. Zarif said that \"by assassinating  in Iraq, the United States delivered a major blow to Iran, more damaging than if it had wiped out an entire city in an attack\".\n\nquestion: How long have Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry known each other?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 320}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry married Dr. Brian Vala Nahed in 2009. The couple met as resident doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Nahed was born in New York. According to a New York Times announcement, the bridegroom graduated magna cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, and received his medical degree cum laude from Yale. His father, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine and critical-care physician, is the chief of staff at Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills, Calif. He also runs a private practice there, which is managed by the bridegroom\u2019s mother. Who is the Iranian in question? Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, and one of the principal negotiators in nuclear talks with the U.S. The stories allege that Zarif was the best man at Kerry\u2019s wedding, but there is no proof that this is true. The rumour started on Allen B. West\u2019s \u2013 a former one-term congressman and conservative pundit \u2013 website in July 2015: \u201cSecretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry\u2019s daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif\u2019s son.\u201d An Iranian news agency called the report a \u201cnews fabrication\u201d and said Zarif\u2019s son wasn\u2019t at the wedding. According to the report: \u201cOfficials at the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday strongly rejected some US media reports alleging that Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif\u2019s son had attended the wedding ceremony of Vanessa Kerry, the daughter of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The foreign ministry\u2019s denial came after several American websites claimed in the last few days that Zarif\u2019s son, Mehdi Zarif, had not only attended the wedding party of Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry and her Iranian American husband doctor Brian Vala Nahed, but also been Vala Nahed\u2019s best man. The report seems to have appeared on the US media not to hurt the Iranian foreign minister, but to damage Kerry\u2019s credit and reputation as the Republicans and the Israeli lobbies have started massive propaganda to torpedo a recent nuclear deal struck between the six world powers and Iran. Only the powerful Israeli lobby group, AIPAC, has declared a 20 million dollar fund for the purpose. And the Vanessa-Brian story only seems to be the beginning.\u201d The conclusion: Not only is Brian Nahed not Iranian, he wasn\u2019t born in Iran, has never held Iranian citizenship, and has never even been to Iran. He is a natural-born US citizen who has lived, attended school, and worked in the US his whole life. Furthermore, he is not close friends with either Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif or Zarif\u2019s son: he doesn\u2019t know either of them, and Zarif\u2019s son was not the best man at his wedding (nor, as some accounts report, was Zarif\u2019s son his college roommate). Vanessa Kerry herself verified that Zarif\u2019s son was not at her wedding: Persian Shrug http://t.co/BtnKMzXM27 via @po_st Happy 2 verify.

He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran \u2013 if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero\u2019s welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \u201cLong live Zarif,\u201d crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \u201cpolished\u201d and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \u201cjovial.\u201d An Internet search for \u201cMohammad Javad Zarif\u201d and \u201cjovial\u201d yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: Iran/P5+1 Statement: \"The EU will TERMINATE the implementation of ALL nuclear-related economic and financial sanctions\". How about this? In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \u201cHappy Rosh Hashanah,\u201d referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \u201cThanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran\u2019s Holocaust denial, sir.\u201d And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \u201cIran never denied it,\u201d Zarif tweeted back. \u201cThe man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\u201d The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad\u2019s successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \u201cdue to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\u201d That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master\u2019s in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \u201cborn to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\u201d Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. Committed to start drafting the comprehensive nuclear deal immediately. All will be served by a serious agreement based on mutual respect. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif\u2019s name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com \u2013 which cites Zarif\u2019s memoirs, titled \u201cMr. Ambassador\u201d \u2013 was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland. \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network\n\nquestion: How long have Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry known each other?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "They have known each other for a long time.", "usage": 1097}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was the foreign minister of Iran from 2013 until 2021 in the government of Hassan Rouhani. During his tenure as foreign minister, he led the Iranian negotiation with P5+1 countries which produced the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on 14 July 2015, lifting the economic sanctions against Iran on 16 January 2016. On 25 February 2019, Zarif resigned from his post as foreign minister. His resignation was rejected by Ali Khamenei and he continued as foreign minister. Before assuming his current position, he held various significant diplomatic and cabinet posts. He is a visiting professor at the School of International Relations and University of Tehran, teaching diplomacy and international organizations. He was the Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations from 2002 to 2007. He served as an advisor and senior advisor to the Foreign Minister, Deputy Foreign Minister in Legal and International affairs, member of the UN Eminent Persons Group on Dialogue Among Civilizations, Head of the UN Disarmament Commission in New York, and Vice President for International Affairs of the Islamic Azad University. Zarif was born in Tehran around 1960, although other sources have given the year of birth as 1959 and 1961. According to The New Republic, Zarif was born to an \"affluent, religiously devout and politically conservative merchant family in Tehran\". His father was one of the most well-known businessmen of Isfahan, and his mother Efat Kashani (d. 2013) was the daughter of one of the most famous businessmen of Tehran. He was educated at the Alavi School, a private religious institution. Zarif was shielded from TV, radio, and newspapers by his parents as a youth. There was only an alarm clock that played the Athan during prayers. Instead, he became exposed to revolutionary ideas by reading the books of Ali Shariati and Samad Behrangi. At age 17, he left Iran for the United States. Zarif attended Drew College Preparatory School, a private college-preparatory high school located in San Francisco, California. He went on to study at San Francisco State University, from which he gained a B.A. in 1981 and M.A. in 1982, both in international relations. Following this, Zarif continued his studies at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, University of Denver, from which he obtained a second M.A. in international relations in 1984 and a Ph.D. in international law and policy in 1988. His thesis was titled \"Self-Defense in International Law and Policy.\" Tom Rowe, a professor at the graduate school who led the committee that oversaw Zarif's dissertation, said: \"He was among the very best students that I've ever taught.\" Ved Nanda, who taught and was on Zarif's dissertation committee, recalled: \" good in the classroom. At that time... I thought he'd play an important part in his country's life.\" Zarif was appointed a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations in May 1982 \u2013 largely due to his English-speaking ability and relationships in America, rather than formal diplomatic training. As a junior diplomat Zarif was involved in negotiations to win the release of U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian gunmen in Lebanon, according to the memoirs of former United Nations envoy Giandomenico Picco. Even though the United States did not make a promised reciprocal goodwill gesture at the time, Zarif remained committed to improving ties. In 2000, Zarif served as chairman of the Asian preparatory meeting of the World Conference on Racism and as the chairman of the United Nations Disarmament Commission. Zarif was also professor of international law at the University of Tehran. He served as the vice president of Islamic Azad University in charge of foreign affairs from 2010 to 2012 under Abdollah Jasbi. He has served on the board of editors of a number of scholarly journals, including the Iranian Journal of International Affairs and Iranian Foreign Policy, and has written extensively on disarmament, human rights, international law, and regional conflicts. Zarif served as Iran's representative at the United Nations from 2002 to 2007. He was closely linked with developing the so-called \"Grand Bargain,\" a plan to resolve outstanding issues between the U.S. and Iran in 2003. Zarif, during his time at the UN, held private meetings with a number of Washington politicians, including the then-Senators Joseph Biden and Chuck Hagel. He resigned from office on 6 July 2007. He was succeeded by Mohammad Khazaee in the post. In 2007, Zarif was a headline speaker at an American Iranian Council conference in New Brunswick, New Jersey including Chuck Hagel, Dennis Kucinich, Nicholas Kristof,\n\nquestion: How long have Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry known each other?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1155}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

On 23 July 2013, it was reported that Zarif was Rouhani's choice for minister of foreign affairs. This was not confirmed by the president-elect's office until 4 August when Rouhani officially nominated Zarif for the position to the Iranian Parliament. He was confirmed by the parliament with 232 votes, replacing Ali Akbar Salehi in the position. Zarif welcomed the first visit by a foreign leader to Iran since Rouhani assumed the presidency ten days after his approval as Foreign Minister with the arrival of Oman's sultan, Qaboos bin Said Al Said. Stories spread that there was a secret agenda to his meetings with Iranian officials, involving claims that he came to convey messages from the United States and then to relay Iran's response to White House officials. On 5 September 2013, in an exchange prompted by his Rosh Hashanah greeting on Twitter, Zarif said that Iran does not deny the Holocaust, distancing the government from the often belligerent stances by former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Genuineness of Zarif's tweeting in English was confirmed by CNN's Christiane Amanpour. On 27 September 2013, he met with United States Secretary of State John Kerry during P5+1 and Iran summit. It was the highest-level direct contact between the United States and Iran in the last six years. After the meeting, Kerry said that \"We had a constructive meeting, and I think all of us were pleased that Foreign Minister Zarif came and made a presentation to us, which was very different in tone and very different in the vision that he held out with respect to possibilities of the future.\" After the breakup of talks on 12 November, Zarif rejected Kerry's claim that Iran had been unable to accept the deal \"at that particular moment\". He said \"no amount of spinning\" could change what had happened in Geneva, but it could \"further erode confidence\". Zarif appeared to blame France for \"gutting over half\" of a US draft deal. Representatives from Iran and the so-called P5+1 \u2013 met again on 20 November. Talks between senior American, Iranian and European diplomats in October 2014 produced no breakthrough agreement on curbing Iran's nuclear program, but officials said they still aimed to reach a deal by the 24 November deadline. A senior State Department official characterized each step of progress in the talks as \"chipping away\" at complex, technical differences, with virtually every sentence requiring an appendix of further explanation. \"We continue to make progress, but there is still a substantial amount of work to be done,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the difficult and secretive negotiations. Zarif and Kerry conferred, ahead of a fresh round of negotiations between Iran and six world powers in Geneva, on settling their 12-year standoff over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Lower-level negotiators on both sides met at the same venue on 15 January 2015 to iron out technical details ahead of negotiations 3 days later between Iran and the \"P5+1\" powers \u2013 the US, France, Germany, Russia, China and Britain. Speaking at a Tehran news conference, Zarif said the purpose of the talks with Kerry \"is to see if we can speed up and push the negotiations forward\". In February, Zarif said that Iran did not favor another extension of the talks on limiting its nuclear program and expected economic sanctions to be quickly lifted if an accord was reached. At a security conference in Munich, he said \"Sanctions are a liability; you need to get rid of them if you want a solution.\" Of the long effort to forge an agreement, he said \"This is the opportunity to do it, and we need to seize this opportunity. It may not be repeated.\" The nuclear talks have already been extended twice and face a late March deadline for working out the main outlines of an accord. The deadline for a detailed agreement is the end of June. Based on the Iran nuclear deal framework, which was declared on 2 April, Iran agreed to accept significant restrictions on its nuclear program for at least a decade and submit to international inspections under a framework deal. In return, international sanctions would be lifted; whether in phases or all at once still needed to be worked out. On 21 November it was reported by Iranian negotiators that progress was being made in talks in Geneva with world powers, expressing hope to bridge differences and sign an elusive deal over Tehran's nuclear drive. In statements carried by Iranian media after a one-hour meeting with Baroness Ashton, Zarif said \"Differences of opinion remain and we are negotiating over them. God willing we will reach a result.\" Three days later, the Geneva interim agreement, officially titled the Joint Plan of Action, was signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in Geneva, Switzerland. It consisted of a short-term freeze of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries worked toward a long-term agreement.

He responded, \"We do not jail people for their opinions\" Zarif condemned U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, saying the United States should be held \"accountable for crimes against humanity\". On 11 February 2019, Zarif met with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Nasrallah thanked Zarif for Iran's support of Hezbollah's fight against 'Zionist aggression', and Zarif affirmed his country's \"firm stance that supports Lebanon and its state, people and resistance\". In an interview conducted by CBS News on 25 April 2019, Zarif said that he was the one who proposed Iran's prisoner swap proposal to the U.S. government in October 2018, the proposal having been unanswered by the U.S. side up until that time. He added that the U.S. government must prove its seriousness before any negotiations. Zarif condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria viewing it as a violation of Syria's sovereignty. However regarding the US withdrawal from Syria Zarif commented saying the US was an \"irrelevant occupier in Syria\", and said that Iran would be willing to mediate tensions between Syria and Turkey. Zarif called the peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates a betrayal against Arab and non-Arab countries in the Middle East. Zarif stepped down from his post on 25 February 2019, announcing his resignation on Instagram. After greetings in honor of Iranian Women's and Mothers' day, he wrote I am apologising  you (wholeheartedly) for my (inability to continue my service and any) shortcomings in the past years during my time as foreign minister... I thank the Iranian nation and officials. Zarif did not elaborate or provide any further explanation. An aide said that one of the reasons for Zarif's resignation was anger over his exclusion that day from meetings with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who was visiting Tehran. Rouhani rejected Zarif's resignation two days later. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force, also rejected Zarif's resignation, with Soleimani remarking that Zarif is the \"main person in charge of foreign policy.\" In July 2019 the United States imposed sanctions on Zarif, and he was identified by the US as an \"illegitimate spokesperson for Iran\". In response, a spokesman for European Union diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini stated, \"We regret this decision.\" On 25 April 2021, The New York Times published content from a leaked audiotape of a three-hour taped conversation between economist Saeed Laylaz and Zarif. The taped conversation was connected to an oral history project, \"In the Islamic Republic the military field rules,\" that documents the work of Iran's current administration. The tape was obtained by the London-based news channel Iran International. In the tape, which the Times refers to as \"extraordinary\" moments, Zarif criticizes Qasem Soleimani and Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and alleges that former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told him that Israel attacked Iranian assets in Syria \"at least 200 times.\" Although the tape has not been authenticated, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman did not deny its validity. Zarif is married and has a daughter who is an interior decorator and a son who is a marketing consultant, both of whom were born in the United States. He met his wife in summer 1979 through his sister. They married in Iran but moved to New York within several weeks in the midst of the Iranian revolution. In addition to his native Persian, he is also fluent in English. Zarif has gained a domestic reputation and popularity among the people. His \"Never threaten an Iranian!\" remark, during the heated nuclear negotiations, gained attention from global news agencies. According to a poll conducted by Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC (iPOS) in March 2016, Zarif was the most popular political figure in Iran with 76% approval and 7% disapproval ratings.\n\nquestion: How long have Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry known each other?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 953}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif claimed in recently leaked audio that John Kerry, when he was serving as Secretary of State during the Obama administration, informed him of more than 200 Israeli operations in Syria. Kerry has previously been accused of colluding with Iranian leaders to undermine the Trump administration. Kerry is now a part of the Biden administration and has a seat on the National Security Council as the special presidential envoy for climate. Kerry shocked Zarif by revealing that Israel had attacked Iranian targets in Syria more than 200 times, according to leaked audio obtained by The New York Times and other outlets. Zarif also spoke frankly about his limited power compared to Ayatollah Ali Khameini and the blow the U.S. dealt to Iran by killing Gen. Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. IRAN\u2019S TOP DIPLOMAT, IN LEAKED RECORDING, OFFERS BLUNT COMMENTS ABOUT RUSSIA, SOLEIMANI Kerry faced criticism on Monday over Zarif's claim. \"John Kerry was ratting out Israeli covert operations in Syria directly to the Iranian foreign minister. Let that sink in. Wow,\" Noah Pollak of the foreign policy-focused Democratic Alliance Group wrote on Twitter. Former special advisor for Iran at the State Department Gabriel Noronha weighed in on Zarif's lasting political career, despite his differences with others in Iranian governnment. \"The main reason Zarif has survived as Foreign Minister for 8 years in Iran\u2019s cutthroat political environment is that he serves as the \u2018reasonable\u2019 storefront to the world, protecting the more empowered radical elements of the regime from Western and press scrutiny,\" Noronha said in a statement. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif prepares to address the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, at United Nations headquarters, Wednesday, July 17, 2019. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) \"Most of the time, Zarif\u2019s Foreign Ministry is relegated to the job of the marketing and PR team, justifying and defending the policy choices of the IRGC and Supreme Leader Khamenei abroad,\" he continued. \"I think the leak was likely instigated by regime insiders who have long hated Zarif and tried to oust him \u2014 they oppose current efforts to rejoin the JCPOA and also want to bolster domestic opposition to President Rouhani and his allies running for office in June.\" The release of the comments by Zarif set off a firestorm within Iran, where officials carefully mind their words amid a cutthroat political environment that includes the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, ultimately overseen by the country's supreme leader. Zarif has been suggested as a possible candidate for Iran's June 18 presidential election as well. In this September file photo, Secretary of State John Kerry, left, meets with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at United Nations headquarters. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) Outside of Iran, Zarif's comments could also affect talks in Vienna aimed at finding a way for Tehran and the U.S. to both come into compliance with Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Already, sabotage targeted Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz during the talks as Tehran has begun enriching a small amount of uranium up to 60% purity, which edges the country closer to weapons-grade levels. After the leak became public, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh did not dispute the tape's authenticity. He told journalists on Monday that the recording represented just a portion of a seven-hour interview Zarif gave to a well-known economist that was to be held for posterity by a think tank associated with the Iranian presidency. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Khatibzadeh called the release of the recording \"illegal\" and described it as \"selectively\" edited, though he and others did not offer opinions on how it became public. Zarif, visiting Iraq on Monday after a trip to Qatar, took no questions from journalists after giving a brief statement in Baghdad.

For months, Iran had been positioning itself for the transition by hosting a Taliban delegation in January and intra-Afghan peace talks in July. In August, Iran\u2019s new president, Ebrahim Raisi, hailed the U.S. withdrawal as \u201can opportunity to restore life, security and durable peace.\u201d But Iran also appeared to be caught off-guard by the Taliban\u2019s sweeping takeover and the rapid collapse of the Afghan army. Iran \u201cis concerned over the escalating violence in Afghanistan, and in light of the Taliban taking control of Herat, calls for guarantees of complete safety for its diplomatic missions and the lives of its staff,\u201d Foreign Ministry Spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh tweeted on August 13. Iran has a strategic interest in Afghanistan, regardless of who is in power. The chaotic aftermath of the Taliban\u2019s takeover held the potential to undermine Tehran\u2019s long-term concerns, including stemming the flow of migrants and refugees, containing narcotics trafficking, maintaining cross-border trade, sharing water resources, ensuring the safety of the Shiite minority, and mitigating the threat from ISIS-Khorasan. Refugees and migrants: Iran has absorbed millions of refugees since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Afghans have also historically sought seasonal work in Iran. Remittance payments, primarily from undocumented Afghan men, have long been an important part of Afghanistan\u2019s cash-strapped economy. As of 2020, Iran hosted some 950,000 documented Afghan refugees and at least 2 million more undocumented Afghans. But Iran has repeatedly tried to expel undocumented Afghans. In the first seven months of 2021, Iran deported more than 360,000 Afghans, according to the U.N. migration agency. Narcotics trafficking: Iran has blamed the Afghan government and its Western allies for failing to crack down on opium production and drug smuggling. Since 1998, Afghanistan has been the world\u2019s top opiate producer. It supplies some 80 percent of the world\u2019s opium, much of which is smuggled to Iran and on to Europe. Between 1979 and 2014, Iran claims to have lost some 4,000 security forces fighting heavily armed drug traffickers along its eastern border. Drug use is a growing domestic problem for Iran too. As of 2020, some 2.8 million Iranians were regular drug users in a population of 84 million. Another 1.6 million were recreational users. Cross-border trade: Since 2001, Iran has sought to increase exports to landlocked Afghanistan. Iran also views Afghanistan as a transportation route to expand economic ties with Central and South Asian countries. In 2017, Iran surpassed Pakistan as Afghanistan\u2019s top trade partner. Trade has largely been one-way. In 2019, Iranian exports\u2014including electricity, oil, cement, machinery, metal products, pharmaceuticals, wheat, fabrics and edible oils\u2014totaled $1.24 billion. But Afghan exports to Iran \u2013including fruit, nuts, carpets, cotton and wool \u2013 amounted to only $15 million. Between March and June 2021, 11 percent of Iran\u2019s non-oil exports went to Afghanistan. Water resources: For decades, Iran and Afghanistan have disputed how to share water resources. The Helmand River flows from the mountains of the Hindu Kush through Afghanistan into southeastern Iran, where it is critical for agriculture, fishing and human consumption. The problem in modern times dates to the 1940s and 1950s, when Afghanistan built two dams\u2014the Kajaki and the Grishk\u2014on the Helmand River that could curtail water flow into Iran. In 1973, the two countries signed a treaty on sharing water resources, which focused heavily on distribution of water from Helmand River, but the accord was neither ratified nor implemented. Subsequent Afghan governments, including the Taliban, built, repaired or upgraded dams on the Helmand. From 1998 to 2001, the Taliban closed the sluices of the Kajaki Dam, cutting off water to Iran during a drought. In 2021, Afghanistan inaugurated another dam, the Kamal Khan, on the Helmand. Amnesty International says Taliban fighters recently tortured and killed members of an ethnic minority in Afghanistan, fueling fears that they will again impose a brutal rule. https://t.co/tSvLOITUK4 The Shiite minority: Iran has long supported the Hazaras, a historically oppressed ethnic minority who make up between 10 percent and 20 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s population. Most Hazaras, like most Iranians, are Shiite. They also speak a dialect of Persian. When the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan, it carried out waves of mass killings of Hazaras in 1998, 2000 and 2001. After the Taliban fell, Iran cultivated influence among the Hazaras by funding cultural and religious activities as well as local media. In 2013, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) began recruiting Hazaras to fight in the new Fat\n\nquestion: How long have Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry known each other?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1139}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Over the next four years, the IRGC deployed to Syria up to 50,000 Afghans, mostly refugees who were living in Iran. The Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K): Iran has been deeply concerned about the Afghan branch of the Islamic State that emerged in 2015. ISIS-K considers Shiites apostates and has targeted them in Afghanistan. In 2020, ISIS-K gunmen allegedly killed 16 people, including infants, at a maternity hospital in a mostly Hazara neighborhood in Kabul. In December 2020, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested that the Afghan government consider regrouping Fatemiyoun fighters for the fight against ISIS-K. Iran has long supported efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. Tehran was a key player during the Bonn talks, the international diplomacy to form a new government after the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance toppled the Taliban government in 2001. The Iranian delegation, headed by then-Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, made two particularly important contributions, according to James Dobbins, the U.S. envoy. First, Iranian diplomats suggested that the Bonn agreement require the new Afghan government to commit to holding democratic elections and fighting terrorism, items that were omitted in the initial draft. Second, Zarif persuaded the Northern Alliance to give up several ministries, paving the way for the formation of Hamid Karzai\u2019s government. Iran has also invested heavily in the economic development of its eastern neighbor, the seventh poorest country in the world. At the 2002 Afghanistan Recovery and Reconstruction Conference in Tokyo, Iran pledged $560 million over five years. Iran pledged another $100 million at the 2006 London Conference. Iran helped construct roads, railways, schools, energy and water infrastructure, especially in central and northern Afghanistan. In 2011, Iran announced that it had spent $600 million on infrastructure alone. Iran funded construction of the first railway link between the two countries, a 90-mile (140 kilometer) line from Khaf in northeastern Iran to Ghoryan in western Afghanistan. The line, inaugurated in 2020, is designed to eventually extend another 53 miles to Herat, Afghanistan\u2019s third largest city. Much of Iran\u2019s investment has been focused in and around Herat. For centuries, the city has been in Iran\u2019s cultural sphere of influence. It was ruled by the Iranian Safavid dynasty from 1507 to 1716. The Iranian Qajar dynasty only relinquished its claim to Herat after losing to the British in the Anglo-Persian war of 1856-57. Iran has reprised its mediator role since Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced a road map for potential peace talks with the Taliban in November 2018. On December 26, 2018, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), visited Kabul to meet with Afghan officials. He announced that Iran had been holding talks with the Taliban in coordination with the Afghan government. Four days later, a Taliban delegation visited Tehran for talks. \u201cSince the Islamic Republic of Iran is a powerful neighbor of Afghanistan, we should discuss the future of our country with Tehran in order to take positive steps towards strengthening friendship and peace on both sides,\u201d Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told the Iranian Labour News Agency in January 2019. Iran hosted more Taliban delegations in September 2019, November 2019, January 2021 and July 2021. Iran, a predominantly Shiite country, opposed the Taliban, a Sunni movement far more rigid in its strict application of Islamic law, when it ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. In 1998, tensions between Iran and the Taliban almost escalated into war after eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist were killed by Taliban militants in northern Mazar-i-Sharif. When the Iranian nationals went missing, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the \u201cworthless and lowly\u201d Taliban had \u201cno understanding of Islam or politics.\u201d But since at least 2007, the Islamic Republic has tried to navigate a policy that includes outreach to both the elected Afghan government and the Taliban. Iran covertly armed, trained and funded the Taliban while engaging with Kabul. Tehran provided the Taliban with small arms, explosives, mortars, RPGs, heavy machine guns, and rockets, according to the Pentagon. In 2015, a Taliban delegation led by Muhammad Tayyab Agha, the head of the Taliban\u2019s political office in Qatar, visited Tehran for talks on Afghanistan and regional issues. The Taliban acknowledged that its officials had visited Iran before. In 2016, Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour secretly visited Iran for talks; he was killed in a U.S. drone strike as he returned to Pakistan. In 2019, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessed that Tehran did not want to return the Taliban to power but aimed to \u201cmaintain influence with the group as a hedge in the event that the Taliban gains a role in a\n\nquestion: How long have Mohammad Javad Zarif and John Kerry known each other?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1145}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

July 7-8: In Tehran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hosted peace talks with Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the Taliban\u2019s chief negotiator, and former Vice President Younus Qanooni, representing the Kabul government. Zarif urged them to \u201ctake difficult decisions today for the future of their country.\u201d Iran was \u201cready to assist the dialogue\u201d and to \u201cresolve the current conflicts in the country\u201d following the \u201cfailure of the U.S. in Afghanistan,\u201d he said. Zarif subsequently tweeted that the meeting had been \u201ccordial\u201d and promised Iran would stand with Afghans on their road to peace. After further talks on July 8, the two sides released a joint statement condemning attacks on civilians and public institutions. They agreed that \u201cwar is not the solution to the Afghanistan problem.\u201d Iran has deployed its 65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade (NOHED) in Taibad along the Afghan border amid Taliban's seizure of border crossings pic.twitter.com/9t9WfcdbCx July 9: The Taliban seized Islam Qala, a major border crossing between Iran and Afghanistan. The crossing had reportedly generated some $20 million in monthly revenue for the Afghan government. Videos circulated of Taliban fighters removing the Afghan flag from the border crossing. July 15-16: Rasoul Mousavi, the head of the west Asia department in Iran\u2019s foreign ministry, visited Kabul for talks with senior Afghan government officials, including Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation. \u201cIran supports putting an end to the situation in Afghanistan and resolving the crisis through dialogue,\u201d Mousavi told Abdullah. \u201cOpportunities pass like clouds. The opportunity of peace must be taken today, not tomorrow, as it might be late,\u201d Mousavi tweeted on his way back to Iran on July 17. Aug. 1: Iran\u2019s embassy in Kabul urged Iranians outside of the capital to leave Afghanistan. \u201cIt is recommended to the nationals of the Islamic Republic of Iran who live or do business in Afghan districts and cities other than the city of Kabul to immediately leave the Afghan territory,\u201d the embassy said in a statement following reports of Taliban attacks on an airport in Kandahar. Aug. 5: Iran reportedly allowed some Afghans with legal documents, including government officials and their families, to enter via a crossing with Afghanistan\u2019s Nimruz province. But undocumented Afghans were reportedly turned away.

They agreed that intra-Afghan talks were the best way to stem the violence. \u201cThe international community must take an unequivocal stance in support of the political settlement for the crisis in Afghanistan and also condemn violence and its consequences,\u201d Zarif said. He also blamed foreign powers for the chaos in Afghanistan. Arnault said that Iran and other countries in the region could play a key role in supporting the peace process. Iran\u2019s special envoy for Afghanistan, Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, reiterated Tehran\u2019s support for intra-Afghan talks during a phone call with Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan\u2019s High Council for National Reconciliation. In a video circulated on social media, Iranian border guards refused to hand over Afghan army troops to the Taliban. Aug. 9: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Khatibzadeh said that Iran was in contact with the Taliban regarding border security. \u201cThere have been occasional developments at our borders, but the borders have been calm during this period with the efforts of the border guards and the courageous Army forces, Khatibzadeh said. \u201cWe have tried to send the message that Iran\u2019s borders must remain calm.\u201d Aug. 10: Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar hosted Iran\u2019s special envoy, Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, in Kabul to discuss Tehran\u2019s role in facilitating peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.

Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Mohammad Javad Zarif's Diplomatic Career and Relationships\n\nevidence: About this rating On 28 July 2015, the web site of Allen B. West, a former one-term congressman and conservative pundit, published an article asserting that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had hidden a close familial connection to an Iranian official with whom he had negotiated a nuclear deal. According to that article (\"You will NOT BELIEVE who was best man at John Kerry's daughter's wedding\"), John Kerry concealed the information that his son-in-law was Iranian during the U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for his position as secretary of state. Moreover, throughout the negotiations over a deal limiting Iran's development of nuclear weapons, Kerry hid the fact that he was buddy-buddy with Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister whom he negotiated the nuclear deal \u2014 so much so that the best man at the wedding of Kerry's daughter was Zarif's son: You not might be aware that in 2009, the daughter of Secretary of State John Kerry, Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerry's younger daughter by his first wife, married an Iranian-American physician named Dr. Brian (Behrooz) Vala Nahed. Of course you're not aware of it. Brian (Behrooz) Nahed is son of Nooshin and Reza Vala Nahid of Los Angeles. Brian's Persian birth name is \"Behrooz Vala Nahid\" but it is now shortened and Americanized in the media to \"Brian Nahed.\" At the time his engagement to Bradford Kerry, there was rarely any mention of Nahed's Persian/Iranian ancestry, and even the official wedding announcement in the October 2009 issue of New York Times carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)'s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college years. Gosh, I wonder why?? Gee, do you think Secretary Kerry should have recused himself from the negotiations with Iran at the very outset because of his long-standing relationship to his Iranian counter-part, Mohammad Javad Zarif? Let me explain. Zarif is the current minister of foreign affairs in the Rouhani administration and has held various significant diplomatic and cabinet posts since the 1990s. He was Kerry's chief counterpart in the nuclear deal negotiations. Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry's daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif's son. Does this bother anyone at all? Apparently Kerry only revealed his daughter's marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of State. But the subject never came up in his Senate confirmation hearing, either because Kerry never disclosed it, or because his former colleagues were \"too polite\" to bring it up. As Front Page Magazine pointed out several months ago, the nuclear talks with Iran were a tragic farce, choreographed and orchestrated by Iran. And unfortunately, we're going to have to live with the consequences. At least, I hope we live. All of this information was wrong. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerry's daughter from his previous marriage to writer Julia Stimson Thorne (from whom he was divorced in 1988), married Brian Vala Nahed on 10 October 2009. Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he is an American-born U.S. citizen who attended school at UCLA and Yale and is currently a neurosurgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital (where his wife is also a physician specializing in critical care). This information has been plainly available for years in his official workplace biography on the Massachusetts General Hospital web site: Dr. Brian Nahed is a neurosurgeon who specializes in brain tumors (glioblastoma, gliomas, metastatic brain tumors, and meningiomas) as well as Spinal Disorders. Dr. Nahed's clinic interest are in tumors of the eloquent cortex requiring awake surgery, language and motor mapping, and subcortical stimulation. Born in New York, Dr. Nahed attended UCLA where he majored in Neuroscience, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and with the department's Highest Honors. He attended the Yale School of Medicine where he was awarded the Doris Duke Clinical Research Fellowship and graduated with honors. Dr. Nahed completed his internship and neurosurgery residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital; where Dr. Nahed also completed a postdoctoral fellowship with Drs. Daniel Haber and Shyamala Maheswaran in the MGH Cancer Center. Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he was not born in Iran, he has never held Iranian citizenship, he has never worked or lived in Iran, and he has never even been to Iran. He's a natural-born U.S. citizen from New York who has lived, attended school, and worked in the United States his whole life\n\nquestion: Who did Mohammad Javad Zarif lead negotiations with as the foreign minister of Iran?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "John Kerry", "usage": 1123}, "You are an answer-extraction expert. Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Mohammad Javad Zarif's Diplomatic Career and Relationships\n\nevidence: . More important, he is not close friends with either Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif or Zarif's son: he doesn't know either of them, and Zarif's son was not the best man at his wedding (nor, as some accounts report, was Zarif's son his college roommate). Vanessa Kerry herself verified to us that Zarif's son was not at her wedding: The small piece of information here that is true is that Brian Nahed's parents were themselves born in Iran. However, they permanently left that country to immigrate to the U.S. forty years ago, well before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and now live in Los Angeles (where Brian's father also works as a physician). As for the rest of the \"facts\" presented in the Westian article, they were nothing more than a collection of supposition and innuendo, such as the claim that John Kerry \"only revealed his daughter's marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of State\" in 2013. By the article's own admission, that marriage had been very publicly covered in wedding announcement published by the New York Times in 2009, one which used the full \"Persianized\" versions of Brian's parents' names \u2014 something hardly suggestive of the notion that the media were conspiring to cover up revelation of their ancestry: The bride, who is a stepdaughter of Teresa Heinz Kerry and Richard J. Charlesworth, and the bridegroom, a son of Nooshin P. Nahed and Dr. Reza M. Nahed of Los Angeles, were married Saturday evening at Brandegee House, a Tuscan-style villa in Boston. The Right Rev. M. Thomas Shaw, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, officiated. Dr. Kerry and Dr. Nahed, both 32, are residents at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She is in her third year of a residency in internal medicine; he is in his fifth year of a residency in neurological surgery. More absurdly, the article's statement that \"even the official  wedding announcement carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)'s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college years\" was deliberately misleading and specious, as that wedding announcement also made no mention of the bride's birthplace and started her biography from her college years (which is in fact quite common in wedding announcements, especially those of people who have achieved significant accomplishments in adulthood). And it makes no logical sense whatsoever that anyone attempting to hide Brian Nahed's familial connection to Iran would \"carefully avoid any reference\" to his \"foreign\" birthplace of New York. Finally, the unsourced statement that \"Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise.\" is (even if true) little more than out-of-context innuendo intended to suggest some kind of close pre-negotiation friendship between the two figures without providing any actual evidence of it. Both men have an extensive history of political and diplomatic service to their countries over the last thirty years: Mohammad Javad Zarif lived in and was educated (up to the PhD level) in the United States, served as a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations (a position in which he met with a number of Washington politicians), has been a headline speaker at foreign policy conferences in the U.S. (attended by prominent Washington politicians), and has been Iran's minister of foreign affairs since 2013, while John Kerry served several terms in the U.S. Senate, was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, chaired the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, and has been U.S. Secretary of State since 2013. It's hardly a \"surprise\" to anyone the least bit familiar with the political world that two men who have long held high positions in their countries' national governments and been closely involved with foreign affairs might have crossed paths at some point prior to their first negotiation as their countries' official representatives.

The taped conversation was connected to an oral history project, titled \"In the Islamic Republic, the military field rules,\" that documents the work of then-president Hassan Rouhani and his government. The tape was obtained by the London-based news channel Iran International and publicized by The New York Times. Zarif did not dispute the authenticity of the leaked tape, but questioned the motive. Iran International noted that Zarif's claim was \"not very credible.\" Although the tape has not been authenticated, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman did not deny its validity, and critics of Zarif were calling for his resignation, saying that \"he had threatened Iran\u2019s national security by revealing to the world the country\u2019s inner politics\". Iran's president Hassan Rouhani ordered an investigation to identify who leaked the tape. He stated that it was \"stolen for clear reasons\". On May 2, 2021, in an Instagram post, Zarif apologized for the remarks that he made against Soleimani. In the tape, Zarif said former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told him that Israel attacked Iranian assets in Syria \"at least 200 times.\" Zarif said that he was astonished by the admission. Kerry was not recorded speaking on the tape, and the date of the recording is unknown. A posting on Iran International's website indicated that Zarif was taken aback, that it was not the IRGC who informed him about the Israeli strikes against Iran, but Kerry. NBC reported that the leaked tape \"inflamed a debate raging in Iran over the nuclear deal\" with upcoming presidential elections. Also, its effects in the US where \"Republican opponents of nuclear diplomacy with Iran have seized on Zarif's account\". On September 27, 2013, Kerry met with Zarif during the P5+1 and Iran summit, which eventually led to the JCPOA nuclear agreement. It was the highest-level direct contact between the United States and Iran in the last six years, and it made Kerry the first U.S. Secretary of State to have met with his Iranian counterpart since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. In April 2021, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State Ned Price stated in a press briefing that he couldn't confirm the accuracy or authenticity of the Zarif audiotape or its claims, but implied that Kerry would not have likely been disclosing confidential information if it occurred. He stated that prior press reporting of Israeli attacks on Syria would have made the suspected call contents already part of the public record, making Kerry's alleged disclosures to Zarif as not confidential. As CNN noted, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed in July 2017 that Israeli airstrikes had targeted Iranian-backed Hezbollah-bound convoys in Syria \"dozens of times\", and in August 2017, Israeli Air Force chief Maj. Gen. Amir Eshel confirmed that Israel had attacked convoys bringing arms to Hezbollah several times over the past five years. In 2018, Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz stated that \"in the last two years Israel has taken military action  more than 200 times within Syria itself.\" However, it is unclear whether Kerry allegedly revealed the Israeli operations to Zarif before or after Israel itself publicly reported them in 2018. In May 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported that then-President Donald Trump said that Kerry \u201cshould be prosecuted\u201d for meeting privately with Iranian officials. Nineteen Republican senators signed a letter asking President Joe Biden to investigate the Zarif claim, writing: \"We write to convey our grave concerns over U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry\u2019s position as a member of your administration's National Security Council and his record \u2013 both past and present \u2013 of potentially working with America\u2019s adversaries against our national security interests and those of our allies. We ask you to investigate recent allegations that Secretary Kerry revealed sensitive information to the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, and if true, call for his removal from your national security team.\" Three Republican representatives, Ann Wagner, Andy Barr, and Lee Zeldin, sent a letter to Diana Shaw, the State Department's acting inspector general, asking for a full investigation into Zarif's claims. In the letter they wrote, \u201cGiven the gravity of the security threat Iran poses to U.S. and Israeli interests, we respectfully ask that you fully investigate these allegations...Iran is a serious threat to Israel, a bulwark of democracy and stability in the Middle East. It is in our national security interest to stand by our strategic ally - not sell it out to our adversaries\u201d. The letter also requested that Shaw make a determination if Kerry should have his security clearance revoked. The lawmakers inquired what role Kerry had in formulating the Biden administration's policy on re-entering the JCPOA. They also questioned whether the state department knew of any Iranian proxy \u201cfollow-on attacks\u201d made against Israel after Kerry allegedly met with Zarif\n\nquestion: Who did Mohammad Javad Zarif lead negotiations with as the foreign minister of Iran?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1123}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In May 2021, Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee requested documents from the White House regarding Kerry's security clearance.

In a tweet, Kerry denied Zarif's account, writing: \u201cI can tell you that this story and these allegations are unequivocally false. This never happened \u2014 either when I was Secretary of State or since.\u201d Starting on April 27, 2021, some Republicans suggested that Kerry should resign from the Biden administration's National Security Council or were highly critical of Kerry's alleged disclosures. Other Republicans expressed uncertainty about the tape's veracity. In the tape, Zarif spoke about his relationship with Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by a United States drone strike in 2020. Zarif said that \"by assassinating  in Iraq, the United States delivered a major blow to Iran, more damaging than if it had wiped out an entire city in an attack\".\n\nquestion: Who did Mohammad Javad Zarif lead negotiations with as the foreign minister of Iran?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 322}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry married Dr. Brian Vala Nahed in 2009. The couple met as resident doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Nahed was born in New York. According to a New York Times announcement, the bridegroom graduated magna cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, and received his medical degree cum laude from Yale. His father, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine and critical-care physician, is the chief of staff at Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills, Calif. He also runs a private practice there, which is managed by the bridegroom\u2019s mother. Who is the Iranian in question? Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, and one of the principal negotiators in nuclear talks with the U.S. The stories allege that Zarif was the best man at Kerry\u2019s wedding, but there is no proof that this is true. The rumour started on Allen B. West\u2019s \u2013 a former one-term congressman and conservative pundit \u2013 website in July 2015: \u201cSecretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry\u2019s daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif\u2019s son.\u201d An Iranian news agency called the report a \u201cnews fabrication\u201d and said Zarif\u2019s son wasn\u2019t at the wedding. According to the report: \u201cOfficials at the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday strongly rejected some US media reports alleging that Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif\u2019s son had attended the wedding ceremony of Vanessa Kerry, the daughter of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The foreign ministry\u2019s denial came after several American websites claimed in the last few days that Zarif\u2019s son, Mehdi Zarif, had not only attended the wedding party of Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry and her Iranian American husband doctor Brian Vala Nahed, but also been Vala Nahed\u2019s best man. The report seems to have appeared on the US media not to hurt the Iranian foreign minister, but to damage Kerry\u2019s credit and reputation as the Republicans and the Israeli lobbies have started massive propaganda to torpedo a recent nuclear deal struck between the six world powers and Iran. Only the powerful Israeli lobby group, AIPAC, has declared a 20 million dollar fund for the purpose. And the Vanessa-Brian story only seems to be the beginning.\u201d The conclusion: Not only is Brian Nahed not Iranian, he wasn\u2019t born in Iran, has never held Iranian citizenship, and has never even been to Iran. He is a natural-born US citizen who has lived, attended school, and worked in the US his whole life. Furthermore, he is not close friends with either Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif or Zarif\u2019s son: he doesn\u2019t know either of them, and Zarif\u2019s son was not the best man at his wedding (nor, as some accounts report, was Zarif\u2019s son his college roommate).

The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran\u2019s Holocaust denial, sir.\u201d And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \u201cIran never denied it,\u201d Zarif tweeted back. \u201cThe man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\u201d The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad\u2019s successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \u201cdue to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\u201d That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master\u2019s in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \u201cborn to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\u201d Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. Committed to start drafting the comprehensive nuclear deal immediately. All will be served by a serious agreement based on mutual respect. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif\u2019s name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com \u2013 which cites Zarif\u2019s memoirs, titled \u201cMr. Ambassador\u201d \u2013 was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland. \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network\n\nquestion: Who did Mohammad Javad Zarif lead negotiations with as the foreign minister of Iran?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry", "usage": 1097}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was the foreign minister of Iran from 2013 until 2021 in the government of Hassan Rouhani. During his tenure as foreign minister, he led the Iranian negotiation with P5+1 countries which produced the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on 14 July 2015, lifting the economic sanctions against Iran on 16 January 2016. On 25 February 2019, Zarif resigned from his post as foreign minister. His resignation was rejected by Ali Khamenei and he continued as foreign minister. Before assuming his current position, he held various significant diplomatic and cabinet posts. He is a visiting professor at the School of International Relations and University of Tehran, teaching diplomacy and international organizations. He was the Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations from 2002 to 2007. He served as an advisor and senior advisor to the Foreign Minister, Deputy Foreign Minister in Legal and International affairs, member of the UN Eminent Persons Group on Dialogue Among Civilizations, Head of the UN Disarmament Commission in New York, and Vice President for International Affairs of the Islamic Azad University. Zarif was born in Tehran around 1960, although other sources have given the year of birth as 1959 and 1961. According to The New Republic, Zarif was born to an \"affluent, religiously devout and politically conservative merchant family in Tehran\". His father was one of the most well-known businessmen of Isfahan, and his mother Efat Kashani (d. 2013) was the daughter of one of the most famous businessmen of Tehran. He was educated at the Alavi School, a private religious institution. Zarif was shielded from TV, radio, and newspapers by his parents as a youth. There was only an alarm clock that played the Athan during prayers. Instead, he became exposed to revolutionary ideas by reading the books of Ali Shariati and Samad Behrangi. At age 17, he left Iran for the United States. Zarif attended Drew College Preparatory School, a private college-preparatory high school located in San Francisco, California. He went on to study at San Francisco State University, from which he gained a B.A. in 1981 and M.A. in 1982, both in international relations. Following this, Zarif continued his studies at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, University of Denver, from which he obtained a second M.A. in international relations in 1984 and a Ph.D. in international law and policy in 1988. His thesis was titled \"Self-Defense in International Law and Policy.\" Tom Rowe, a professor at the graduate school who led the committee that oversaw Zarif's dissertation, said: \"He was among the very best students that I've ever taught.\" Ved Nanda, who taught and was on Zarif's dissertation committee, recalled: \" good in the classroom. At that time... I thought he'd play an important part in his country's life.\" Zarif was appointed a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations in May 1982 \u2013 largely due to his English-speaking ability and relationships in America, rather than formal diplomatic training. As a junior diplomat Zarif was involved in negotiations to win the release of U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian gunmen in Lebanon, according to the memoirs of former United Nations envoy Giandomenico Picco. Even though the United States did not make a promised reciprocal goodwill gesture at the time, Zarif remained committed to improving ties. In 2000, Zarif served as chairman of the Asian preparatory meeting of the World Conference on Racism and as the chairman of the United Nations Disarmament Commission. Zarif was also professor of international law at the University of Tehran. He served as the vice president of Islamic Azad University in charge of foreign affairs from 2010 to 2012 under Abdollah Jasbi. He has served on the board of editors of a number of scholarly journals, including the Iranian Journal of International Affairs and Iranian Foreign Policy, and has written extensively on disarmament, human rights, international law, and regional conflicts. Zarif served as Iran's representative at the United Nations from 2002 to 2007. He was closely linked with developing the so-called \"Grand Bargain,\" a plan to resolve outstanding issues between the U.S. and Iran in 2003. Zarif, during his time at the UN, held private meetings with a number of Washington politicians, including the then-Senators Joseph Biden and Chuck Hagel. He resigned from office on 6 July 2007. He was succeeded by Mohammad Khazaee in the post. In 2007, Zarif was a headline speaker at an American Iranian Council conference in New Brunswick, New Jersey including Chuck Hagel, Dennis Kucinich, Nicholas Kristof,\n\nquestion: Who did Mohammad Javad Zarif lead negotiations with as the foreign minister of Iran?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "P5+1 countries", "usage": 1160}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

On 23 July 2013, it was reported that Zarif was Rouhani's choice for minister of foreign affairs. This was not confirmed by the president-elect's office until 4 August when Rouhani officially nominated Zarif for the position to the Iranian Parliament. He was confirmed by the parliament with 232 votes, replacing Ali Akbar Salehi in the position. Zarif welcomed the first visit by a foreign leader to Iran since Rouhani assumed the presidency ten days after his approval as Foreign Minister with the arrival of Oman's sultan, Qaboos bin Said Al Said. Stories spread that there was a secret agenda to his meetings with Iranian officials, involving claims that he came to convey messages from the United States and then to relay Iran's response to White House officials. On 5 September 2013, in an exchange prompted by his Rosh Hashanah greeting on Twitter, Zarif said that Iran does not deny the Holocaust, distancing the government from the often belligerent stances by former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Genuineness of Zarif's tweeting in English was confirmed by CNN's Christiane Amanpour. On 27 September 2013, he met with United States Secretary of State John Kerry during P5+1 and Iran summit. It was the highest-level direct contact between the United States and Iran in the last six years. After the meeting, Kerry said that \"We had a constructive meeting, and I think all of us were pleased that Foreign Minister Zarif came and made a presentation to us, which was very different in tone and very different in the vision that he held out with respect to possibilities of the future.\" After the breakup of talks on 12 November, Zarif rejected Kerry's claim that Iran had been unable to accept the deal \"at that particular moment\". He said \"no amount of spinning\" could change what had happened in Geneva, but it could \"further erode confidence\". Zarif appeared to blame France for \"gutting over half\" of a US draft deal. Representatives from Iran and the so-called P5+1 \u2013 met again on 20 November. Talks between senior American, Iranian and European diplomats in October 2014 produced no breakthrough agreement on curbing Iran's nuclear program, but officials said they still aimed to reach a deal by the 24 November deadline. A senior State Department official characterized each step of progress in the talks as \"chipping away\" at complex, technical differences, with virtually every sentence requiring an appendix of further explanation. \"We continue to make progress, but there is still a substantial amount of work to be done,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the difficult and secretive negotiations. Zarif and Kerry conferred, ahead of a fresh round of negotiations between Iran and six world powers in Geneva, on settling their 12-year standoff over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Lower-level negotiators on both sides met at the same venue on 15 January 2015 to iron out technical details ahead of negotiations 3 days later between Iran and the \"P5+1\" powers \u2013 the US, France, Germany, Russia, China and Britain. Speaking at a Tehran news conference, Zarif said the purpose of the talks with Kerry \"is to see if we can speed up and push the negotiations forward\". In February, Zarif said that Iran did not favor another extension of the talks on limiting its nuclear program and expected economic sanctions to be quickly lifted if an accord was reached. At a security conference in Munich, he said \"Sanctions are a liability; you need to get rid of them if you want a solution.\" Of the long effort to forge an agreement, he said \"This is the opportunity to do it, and we need to seize this opportunity. It may not be repeated.\" The nuclear talks have already been extended twice and face a late March deadline for working out the main outlines of an accord. The deadline for a detailed agreement is the end of June. Based on the Iran nuclear deal framework, which was declared on 2 April, Iran agreed to accept significant restrictions on its nuclear program for at least a decade and submit to international inspections under a framework deal. In return, international sanctions would be lifted; whether in phases or all at once still needed to be worked out. On 21 November it was reported by Iranian negotiators that progress was being made in talks in Geneva with world powers, expressing hope to bridge differences and sign an elusive deal over Tehran's nuclear drive. In statements carried by Iranian media after a one-hour meeting with Baroness Ashton, Zarif said \"Differences of opinion remain and we are negotiating over them. God willing we will reach a result.\" Three days later, the Geneva interim agreement, officially titled the Joint Plan of Action, was signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in Geneva, Switzerland. It consisted of a short-term freeze of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries worked toward a long-term agreement.

He responded, \"We do not jail people for their opinions\" Zarif condemned U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, saying the United States should be held \"accountable for crimes against humanity\". On 11 February 2019, Zarif met with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Nasrallah thanked Zarif for Iran's support of Hezbollah's fight against 'Zionist aggression', and Zarif affirmed his country's \"firm stance that supports Lebanon and its state, people and resistance\". In an interview conducted by CBS News on 25 April 2019, Zarif said that he was the one who proposed Iran's prisoner swap proposal to the U.S. government in October 2018, the proposal having been unanswered by the U.S. side up until that time. He added that the U.S. government must prove its seriousness before any negotiations. Zarif condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria viewing it as a violation of Syria's sovereignty. However regarding the US withdrawal from Syria Zarif commented saying the US was an \"irrelevant occupier in Syria\", and said that Iran would be willing to mediate tensions between Syria and Turkey. Zarif called the peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates a betrayal against Arab and non-Arab countries in the Middle East. Zarif stepped down from his post on 25 February 2019, announcing his resignation on Instagram. After greetings in honor of Iranian Women's and Mothers' day, he wrote I am apologising  you (wholeheartedly) for my (inability to continue my service and any) shortcomings in the past years during my time as foreign minister... I thank the Iranian nation and officials. Zarif did not elaborate or provide any further explanation. An aide said that one of the reasons for Zarif's resignation was anger over his exclusion that day from meetings with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who was visiting Tehran. Rouhani rejected Zarif's resignation two days later. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force, also rejected Zarif's resignation, with Soleimani remarking that Zarif is the \"main person in charge of foreign policy.\" In July 2019 the United States imposed sanctions on Zarif, and he was identified by the US as an \"illegitimate spokesperson for Iran\". In response, a spokesman for European Union diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini stated, \"We regret this decision.\" On 25 April 2021, The New York Times published content from a leaked audiotape of a three-hour taped conversation between economist Saeed Laylaz and Zarif. The taped conversation was connected to an oral history project, \"In the Islamic Republic the military field rules,\" that documents the work of Iran's current administration. The tape was obtained by the London-based news channel Iran International. In the tape, which the Times refers to as \"extraordinary\" moments, Zarif criticizes Qasem Soleimani and Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and alleges that former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told him that Israel attacked Iranian assets in Syria \"at least 200 times.\" Although the tape has not been authenticated, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman did not deny its validity. Zarif is married and has a daughter who is an interior decorator and a son who is a marketing consultant, both of whom were born in the United States. He met his wife in summer 1979 through his sister. They married in Iran but moved to New York within several weeks in the midst of the Iranian revolution. In addition to his native Persian, he is also fluent in English. Zarif has gained a domestic reputation and popularity among the people. His \"Never threaten an Iranian!\" remark, during the heated nuclear negotiations, gained attention from global news agencies. According to a poll conducted by Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC (iPOS) in March 2016, Zarif was the most popular political figure in Iran with 76% approval and 7% disapproval ratings.\n\nquestion: Who did Mohammad Javad Zarif lead negotiations with as the foreign minister of Iran?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 955}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif claimed in recently leaked audio that John Kerry, when he was serving as Secretary of State during the Obama administration, informed him of more than 200 Israeli operations in Syria. Kerry has previously been accused of colluding with Iranian leaders to undermine the Trump administration. Kerry is now a part of the Biden administration and has a seat on the National Security Council as the special presidential envoy for climate. Kerry shocked Zarif by revealing that Israel had attacked Iranian targets in Syria more than 200 times, according to leaked audio obtained by The New York Times and other outlets. Zarif also spoke frankly about his limited power compared to Ayatollah Ali Khameini and the blow the U.S. dealt to Iran by killing Gen. Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. IRAN\u2019S TOP DIPLOMAT, IN LEAKED RECORDING, OFFERS BLUNT COMMENTS ABOUT RUSSIA, SOLEIMANI Kerry faced criticism on Monday over Zarif's claim. \"John Kerry was ratting out Israeli covert operations in Syria directly to the Iranian foreign minister. Let that sink in. Wow,\" Noah Pollak of the foreign policy-focused Democratic Alliance Group wrote on Twitter. Former special advisor for Iran at the State Department Gabriel Noronha weighed in on Zarif's lasting political career, despite his differences with others in Iranian governnment. \"The main reason Zarif has survived as Foreign Minister for 8 years in Iran\u2019s cutthroat political environment is that he serves as the \u2018reasonable\u2019 storefront to the world, protecting the more empowered radical elements of the regime from Western and press scrutiny,\" Noronha said in a statement.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) \"Most of the time, Zarif\u2019s Foreign Ministry is relegated to the job of the marketing and PR team, justifying and defending the policy choices of the IRGC and Supreme Leader Khamenei abroad,\" he continued. \"I think the leak was likely instigated by regime insiders who have long hated Zarif and tried to oust him \u2014 they oppose current efforts to rejoin the JCPOA and also want to bolster domestic opposition to President Rouhani and his allies running for office in June.\" The release of the comments by Zarif set off a firestorm within Iran, where officials carefully mind their words amid a cutthroat political environment that includes the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, ultimately overseen by the country's supreme leader. Zarif has been suggested as a possible candidate for Iran's June 18 presidential election as well. In this September file photo, Secretary of State John Kerry, left, meets with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at United Nations headquarters. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) Outside of Iran, Zarif's comments could also affect talks in Vienna aimed at finding a way for Tehran and the U.S. to both come into compliance with Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Already, sabotage targeted Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz during the talks as Tehran has begun enriching a small amount of uranium up to 60% purity, which edges the country closer to weapons-grade levels. After the leak became public, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh did not dispute the tape's authenticity. He told journalists on Monday that the recording represented just a portion of a seven-hour interview Zarif gave to a well-known economist that was to be held for posterity by a think tank associated with the Iranian presidency. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Khatibzadeh called the release of the recording \"illegal\" and described it as \"selectively\" edited, though he and others did not offer opinions on how it became public.

For months, Iran had been positioning itself for the transition by hosting a Taliban delegation in January and intra-Afghan peace talks in July. In August, Iran\u2019s new president, Ebrahim Raisi, hailed the U.S. withdrawal as \u201can opportunity to restore life, security and durable peace.\u201d But Iran also appeared to be caught off-guard by the Taliban\u2019s sweeping takeover and the rapid collapse of the Afghan army. Iran \u201cis concerned over the escalating violence in Afghanistan, and in light of the Taliban taking control of Herat, calls for guarantees of complete safety for its diplomatic missions and the lives of its staff,\u201d Foreign Ministry Spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh tweeted on August 13. Iran has a strategic interest in Afghanistan, regardless of who is in power. The chaotic aftermath of the Taliban\u2019s takeover held the potential to undermine Tehran\u2019s long-term concerns, including stemming the flow of migrants and refugees, containing narcotics trafficking, maintaining cross-border trade, sharing water resources, ensuring the safety of the Shiite minority, and mitigating the threat from ISIS-Khorasan. Refugees and migrants: Iran has absorbed millions of refugees since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Afghans have also historically sought seasonal work in Iran. Remittance payments, primarily from undocumented Afghan men, have long been an important part of Afghanistan\u2019s cash-strapped economy. As of 2020, Iran hosted some 950,000 documented Afghan refugees and at least 2 million more undocumented Afghans. But Iran has repeatedly tried to expel undocumented Afghans. In the first seven months of 2021, Iran deported more than 360,000 Afghans, according to the U.N. migration agency. Narcotics trafficking: Iran has blamed the Afghan government and its Western allies for failing to crack down on opium production and drug smuggling. Since 1998, Afghanistan has been the world\u2019s top opiate producer. It supplies some 80 percent of the world\u2019s opium, much of which is smuggled to Iran and on to Europe. Between 1979 and 2014, Iran claims to have lost some 4,000 security forces fighting heavily armed drug traffickers along its eastern border. Drug use is a growing domestic problem for Iran too. As of 2020, some 2.8 million Iranians were regular drug users in a population of 84 million. Another 1.6 million were recreational users. Cross-border trade: Since 2001, Iran has sought to increase exports to landlocked Afghanistan. Iran also views Afghanistan as a transportation route to expand economic ties with Central and South Asian countries. In 2017, Iran surpassed Pakistan as Afghanistan\u2019s top trade partner. Trade has largely been one-way. In 2019, Iranian exports\u2014including electricity, oil, cement, machinery, metal products, pharmaceuticals, wheat, fabrics and edible oils\u2014totaled $1.24 billion. But Afghan exports to Iran \u2013including fruit, nuts, carpets, cotton and wool \u2013 amounted to only $15 million. Between March and June 2021, 11 percent of Iran\u2019s non-oil exports went to Afghanistan. Water resources: For decades, Iran and Afghanistan have disputed how to share water resources. The Helmand River flows from the mountains of the Hindu Kush through Afghanistan into southeastern Iran, where it is critical for agriculture, fishing and human consumption. The problem in modern times dates to the 1940s and 1950s, when Afghanistan built two dams\u2014the Kajaki and the Grishk\u2014on the Helmand River that could curtail water flow into Iran. In 1973, the two countries signed a treaty on sharing water resources, which focused heavily on distribution of water from Helmand River, but the accord was neither ratified nor implemented. Subsequent Afghan governments, including the Taliban, built, repaired or upgraded dams on the Helmand. From 1998 to 2001, the Taliban closed the sluices of the Kajaki Dam, cutting off water to Iran during a drought. In 2021, Afghanistan inaugurated another dam, the Kamal Khan, on the Helmand. Amnesty International says Taliban fighters recently tortured and killed members of an ethnic minority in Afghanistan, fueling fears that they will again impose a brutal rule. https://t.co/tSvLOITUK4 The Shiite minority: Iran has long supported the Hazaras, a historically oppressed ethnic minority who make up between 10 percent and 20 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s population. Most Hazaras, like most Iranians, are Shiite. They also speak a dialect of Persian. When the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan, it carried out waves of mass killings of Hazaras in 1998, 2000 and 2001. After the Taliban fell, Iran cultivated influence among the Hazaras by funding cultural and religious activities as well as local media. In 2013, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) began recruiting Hazaras to fight in the new Fat\n\nquestion: Who did Mohammad Javad Zarif lead negotiations with as the foreign minister of Iran?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Taliban", "usage": 1141}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Over the next four years, the IRGC deployed to Syria up to 50,000 Afghans, mostly refugees who were living in Iran. The Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K): Iran has been deeply concerned about the Afghan branch of the Islamic State that emerged in 2015. ISIS-K considers Shiites apostates and has targeted them in Afghanistan. In 2020, ISIS-K gunmen allegedly killed 16 people, including infants, at a maternity hospital in a mostly Hazara neighborhood in Kabul. In December 2020, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested that the Afghan government consider regrouping Fatemiyoun fighters for the fight against ISIS-K. Iran has long supported efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. Tehran was a key player during the Bonn talks, the international diplomacy to form a new government after the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance toppled the Taliban government in 2001. The Iranian delegation, headed by then-Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, made two particularly important contributions, according to James Dobbins, the U.S. envoy. First, Iranian diplomats suggested that the Bonn agreement require the new Afghan government to commit to holding democratic elections and fighting terrorism, items that were omitted in the initial draft. Second, Zarif persuaded the Northern Alliance to give up several ministries, paving the way for the formation of Hamid Karzai\u2019s government. Iran has also invested heavily in the economic development of its eastern neighbor, the seventh poorest country in the world. At the 2002 Afghanistan Recovery and Reconstruction Conference in Tokyo, Iran pledged $560 million over five years. Iran pledged another $100 million at the 2006 London Conference. Iran helped construct roads, railways, schools, energy and water infrastructure, especially in central and northern Afghanistan. In 2011, Iran announced that it had spent $600 million on infrastructure alone. Iran funded construction of the first railway link between the two countries, a 90-mile (140 kilometer) line from Khaf in northeastern Iran to Ghoryan in western Afghanistan. The line, inaugurated in 2020, is designed to eventually extend another 53 miles to Herat, Afghanistan\u2019s third largest city. Much of Iran\u2019s investment has been focused in and around Herat. For centuries, the city has been in Iran\u2019s cultural sphere of influence. It was ruled by the Iranian Safavid dynasty from 1507 to 1716. The Iranian Qajar dynasty only relinquished its claim to Herat after losing to the British in the Anglo-Persian war of 1856-57. Iran has reprised its mediator role since Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced a road map for potential peace talks with the Taliban in November 2018. On December 26, 2018, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), visited Kabul to meet with Afghan officials. He announced that Iran had been holding talks with the Taliban in coordination with the Afghan government. Four days later, a Taliban delegation visited Tehran for talks. \u201cSince the Islamic Republic of Iran is a powerful neighbor of Afghanistan, we should discuss the future of our country with Tehran in order to take positive steps towards strengthening friendship and peace on both sides,\u201d Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told the Iranian Labour News Agency in January 2019. Iran hosted more Taliban delegations in September 2019, November 2019, January 2021 and July 2021. Iran, a predominantly Shiite country, opposed the Taliban, a Sunni movement far more rigid in its strict application of Islamic law, when it ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. In 1998, tensions between Iran and the Taliban almost escalated into war after eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist were killed by Taliban militants in northern Mazar-i-Sharif. When the Iranian nationals went missing, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the \u201cworthless and lowly\u201d Taliban had \u201cno understanding of Islam or politics.\u201d But since at least 2007, the Islamic Republic has tried to navigate a policy that includes outreach to both the elected Afghan government and the Taliban. Iran covertly armed, trained and funded the Taliban while engaging with Kabul. Tehran provided the Taliban with small arms, explosives, mortars, RPGs, heavy machine guns, and rockets, according to the Pentagon. In 2015, a Taliban delegation led by Muhammad Tayyab Agha, the head of the Taliban\u2019s political office in Qatar, visited Tehran for talks on Afghanistan and regional issues. The Taliban acknowledged that its officials had visited Iran before. In 2016, Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour secretly visited Iran for talks; he was killed in a U.S. drone strike as he returned to Pakistan. In 2019, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessed that Tehran did not want to return the Taliban to power but aimed to \u201cmaintain influence with the group as a hedge in the event that the Taliban gains a role in a\n\nquestion: Who did Mohammad Javad Zarif lead negotiations with as the foreign minister of Iran?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Northern Alliance", "usage": 1148}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Zarif subsequently tweeted that the meeting had been \u201ccordial\u201d and promised Iran would stand with Afghans on their road to peace. After further talks on July 8, the two sides released a joint statement condemning attacks on civilians and public institutions. They agreed that \u201cwar is not the solution to the Afghanistan problem.\u201d Iran has deployed its 65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade (NOHED) in Taibad along the Afghan border amid Taliban's seizure of border crossings pic.twitter.com/9t9WfcdbCx July 9: The Taliban seized Islam Qala, a major border crossing between Iran and Afghanistan. The crossing had reportedly generated some $20 million in monthly revenue for the Afghan government. Videos circulated of Taliban fighters removing the Afghan flag from the border crossing. July 15-16: Rasoul Mousavi, the head of the west Asia department in Iran\u2019s foreign ministry, visited Kabul for talks with senior Afghan government officials, including Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation. \u201cIran supports putting an end to the situation in Afghanistan and resolving the crisis through dialogue,\u201d Mousavi told Abdullah. \u201cOpportunities pass like clouds. The opportunity of peace must be taken today, not tomorrow, as it might be late,\u201d Mousavi tweeted on his way back to Iran on July 17. Aug. 1: Iran\u2019s embassy in Kabul urged Iranians outside of the capital to leave Afghanistan. \u201cIt is recommended to the nationals of the Islamic Republic of Iran who live or do business in Afghan districts and cities other than the city of Kabul to immediately leave the Afghan territory,\u201d the embassy said in a statement following reports of Taliban attacks on an airport in Kandahar.

They agreed that intra-Afghan talks were the best way to stem the violence. \u201cThe international community must take an unequivocal stance in support of the political settlement for the crisis in Afghanistan and also condemn violence and its consequences,\u201d Zarif said. He also blamed foreign powers for the chaos in Afghanistan. Arnault said that Iran and other countries in the region could play a key role in supporting the peace process. Iran\u2019s special envoy for Afghanistan, Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, reiterated Tehran\u2019s support for intra-Afghan talks during a phone call with Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan\u2019s High Council for National Reconciliation. In a video circulated on social media, Iranian border guards refused to hand over Afghan army troops to the Taliban. Aug. 9: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Khatibzadeh said that Iran was in contact with the Taliban regarding border security. \u201cThere have been occasional developments at our borders, but the borders have been calm during this period with the efforts of the border guards and the courageous Army forces, Khatibzadeh said. \u201cWe have tried to send the message that Iran\u2019s borders must remain calm.\u201d Aug. 10: Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar hosted Iran\u2019s special envoy, Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, in Kabul to discuss Tehran\u2019s role in facilitating peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.

West, a former one-term congressman and conservative pundit, published an article asserting that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had hidden a close familial connection to an Iranian official with whom he had negotiated a nuclear deal. According to that article (\"You will NOT BELIEVE who was best man at John Kerry's daughter's wedding\"), John Kerry concealed the information that his son-in-law was Iranian during the U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for his position as secretary of state. Moreover, throughout the negotiations over a deal limiting Iran's development of nuclear weapons, Kerry hid the fact that he was buddy-buddy with Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister whom he negotiated the nuclear deal \u2014 so much so that the best man at the wedding of Kerry's daughter was Zarif's son: You not might be aware that in 2009, the daughter of Secretary of State John Kerry, Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerry's younger daughter by his first wife, married an Iranian-American physician named Dr. Brian (Behrooz) Vala Nahed. Of course you're not aware of it. Brian (Behrooz) Nahed is son of Nooshin and Reza Vala Nahid of Los Angeles. Brian's Persian birth name is \"Behrooz Vala Nahid\" but it is now shortened and Americanized in the media to \"Brian Nahed.\" At the time his engagement to Bradford Kerry, there was rarely any mention of Nahed's Persian/Iranian ancestry, and even the official wedding announcement in the October 2009 issue of New York Times carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)'s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college years. Gosh, I wonder why?? Gee, do you think Secretary Kerry should have recused himself from the negotiations with Iran at the very outset because of his long-standing relationship to his Iranian counter-part, Mohammad Javad Zarif? Let me explain. Zarif is the current minister of foreign affairs in the Rouhani administration and has held various significant diplomatic and cabinet posts since the 1990s. He was Kerry's chief counterpart in the nuclear deal negotiations. Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry's daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif's son. Does this bother anyone at all? Apparently Kerry only revealed his daughter's marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of State. But the subject never came up in his Senate confirmation hearing, either because Kerry never disclosed it, or because his former colleagues were \"too polite\" to bring it up. As Front Page Magazine pointed out several months ago, the nuclear talks with Iran were a tragic farce, choreographed and orchestrated by Iran. And unfortunately, we're going to have to live with the consequences. At least, I hope we live. All of this information was wrong. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerry's daughter from his previous marriage to writer Julia Stimson Thorne (from whom he was divorced in 1988), married Brian Vala Nahed on 10 October 2009. Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he is an American-born U.S. citizen who attended school at UCLA and Yale and is currently a neurosurgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital (where his wife is also a physician specializing in critical care). This information has been plainly available for years in his official workplace biography on the Massachusetts General Hospital web site: Dr. Brian Nahed is a neurosurgeon who specializes in brain tumors (glioblastoma, gliomas, metastatic brain tumors, and meningiomas) as well as Spinal Disorders. Dr. Nahed's clinic interest are in tumors of the eloquent cortex requiring awake surgery, language and motor mapping, and subcortical stimulation. Born in New York, Dr. Nahed attended UCLA where he majored in Neuroscience, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and with the department's Highest Honors. He attended the Yale School of Medicine where he was awarded the Doris Duke Clinical Research Fellowship and graduated with honors. Dr. Nahed completed his internship and neurosurgery residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital; where Dr. Nahed also completed a postdoctoral fellowship with Drs. Daniel Haber and Shyamala Maheswaran in the MGH Cancer Center. Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he was not born in Iran, he has never held Iranian citizenship, he has never worked or lived in Iran, and he has never even been to Iran. He's a natural-born U.S. citizen from New York who has lived, attended school, and worked in the United States his whole life\n\nquestion: What was Mohammad Javad Zarif's involvement in the Iranian Consulate takeover?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1122}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

More important, he is not close friends with either Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif or Zarif's son: he doesn't know either of them, and Zarif's son was not the best man at his wedding (nor, as some accounts report, was Zarif's son his college roommate). Vanessa Kerry herself verified to us that Zarif's son was not at her wedding: The small piece of information here that is true is that Brian Nahed's parents were themselves born in Iran. However, they permanently left that country to immigrate to the U.S. forty years ago, well before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and now live in Los Angeles (where Brian's father also works as a physician). As for the rest of the \"facts\" presented in the Westian article, they were nothing more than a collection of supposition and innuendo, such as the claim that John Kerry \"only revealed his daughter's marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of State\" in 2013. By the article's own admission, that marriage had been very publicly covered in wedding announcement published by the New York Times in 2009, one which used the full \"Persianized\" versions of Brian's parents' names \u2014 something hardly suggestive of the notion that the media were conspiring to cover up revelation of their ancestry: The bride, who is a stepdaughter of Teresa Heinz Kerry and Richard J. Charlesworth, and the bridegroom, a son of Nooshin P. Nahed and Dr. Reza M. Nahed of Los Angeles, were married Saturday evening at Brandegee House, a Tuscan-style villa in Boston. The Right Rev. M. Thomas Shaw, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, officiated. Dr. Kerry and Dr. Nahed, both 32, are residents at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She is in her third year of a residency in internal medicine; he is in his fifth year of a residency in neurological surgery. More absurdly, the article's statement that \"even the official  wedding announcement carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)'s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college years\" was deliberately misleading and specious, as that wedding announcement also made no mention of the bride's birthplace and started her biography from her college years (which is in fact quite common in wedding announcements, especially those of people who have achieved significant accomplishments in adulthood). And it makes no logical sense whatsoever that anyone attempting to hide Brian Nahed's familial connection to Iran would \"carefully avoid any reference\" to his \"foreign\" birthplace of New York. Finally, the unsourced statement that \"Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise.\" is (even if true) little more than out-of-context innuendo intended to suggest some kind of close pre-negotiation friendship between the two figures without providing any actual evidence of it. Both men have an extensive history of political and diplomatic service to their countries over the last thirty years: Mohammad Javad Zarif lived in and was educated (up to the PhD level) in the United States, served as a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations (a position in which he met with a number of Washington politicians), has been a headline speaker at foreign policy conferences in the U.S. (attended by prominent Washington politicians), and has been Iran's minister of foreign affairs since 2013, while John Kerry served several terms in the U.S. Senate, was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, chaired the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, and has been U.S. Secretary of State since 2013. It's hardly a \"surprise\" to anyone the least bit familiar with the political world that two men who have long held high positions in their countries' national governments and been closely involved with foreign affairs might have crossed paths at some point prior to their first negotiation as their countries' official representatives.

The taped conversation was connected to an oral history project, titled \"In the Islamic Republic, the military field rules,\" that documents the work of then-president Hassan Rouhani and his government. The tape was obtained by the London-based news channel Iran International and publicized by The New York Times. Zarif did not dispute the authenticity of the leaked tape, but questioned the motive. Iran International noted that Zarif's claim was \"not very credible.\" Although the tape has not been authenticated, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman did not deny its validity, and critics of Zarif were calling for his resignation, saying that \"he had threatened Iran\u2019s national security by revealing to the world the country\u2019s inner politics\". Iran's president Hassan Rouhani ordered an investigation to identify who leaked the tape. He stated that it was \"stolen for clear reasons\". On May 2, 2021, in an Instagram post, Zarif apologized for the remarks that he made against Soleimani. In the tape, Zarif said former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told him that Israel attacked Iranian assets in Syria \"at least 200 times.\" Zarif said that he was astonished by the admission. Kerry was not recorded speaking on the tape, and the date of the recording is unknown. A posting on Iran International's website indicated that Zarif was taken aback, that it was not the IRGC who informed him about the Israeli strikes against Iran, but Kerry. NBC reported that the leaked tape \"inflamed a debate raging in Iran over the nuclear deal\" with upcoming presidential elections. Also, its effects in the US where \"Republican opponents of nuclear diplomacy with Iran have seized on Zarif's account\". On September 27, 2013, Kerry met with Zarif during the P5+1 and Iran summit, which eventually led to the JCPOA nuclear agreement. It was the highest-level direct contact between the United States and Iran in the last six years, and it made Kerry the first U.S. Secretary of State to have met with his Iranian counterpart since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. In April 2021, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State Ned Price stated in a press briefing that he couldn't confirm the accuracy or authenticity of the Zarif audiotape or its claims, but implied that Kerry would not have likely been disclosing confidential information if it occurred. He stated that prior press reporting of Israeli attacks on Syria would have made the suspected call contents already part of the public record, making Kerry's alleged disclosures to Zarif as not confidential. As CNN noted, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed in July 2017 that Israeli airstrikes had targeted Iranian-backed Hezbollah-bound convoys in Syria \"dozens of times\", and in August 2017, Israeli Air Force chief Maj. Gen. Amir Eshel confirmed that Israel had attacked convoys bringing arms to Hezbollah several times over the past five years. In 2018, Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz stated that \"in the last two years Israel has taken military action  more than 200 times within Syria itself.\" However, it is unclear whether Kerry allegedly revealed the Israeli operations to Zarif before or after Israel itself publicly reported them in 2018. In May 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported that then-President Donald Trump said that Kerry \u201cshould be prosecuted\u201d for meeting privately with Iranian officials. Nineteen Republican senators signed a letter asking President Joe Biden to investigate the Zarif claim, writing: \"We write to convey our grave concerns over U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry\u2019s position as a member of your administration's National Security Council and his record \u2013 both past and present \u2013 of potentially working with America\u2019s adversaries against our national security interests and those of our allies. We ask you to investigate recent allegations that Secretary Kerry revealed sensitive information to the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, and if true, call for his removal from your national security team.\" Three Republican representatives, Ann Wagner, Andy Barr, and Lee Zeldin, sent a letter to Diana Shaw, the State Department's acting inspector general, asking for a full investigation into Zarif's claims. In the letter they wrote, \u201cGiven the gravity of the security threat Iran poses to U.S. and Israeli interests, we respectfully ask that you fully investigate these allegations...Iran is a serious threat to Israel, a bulwark of democracy and stability in the Middle East. It is in our national security interest to stand by our strategic ally - not sell it out to our adversaries\u201d. The letter also requested that Shaw make a determination if Kerry should have his security clearance revoked. The lawmakers inquired what role Kerry had in formulating the Biden administration's policy on re-entering the JCPOA. They also questioned whether the state department knew of any Iranian proxy \u201cfollow-on attacks\u201d made against Israel after Kerry allegedly met with Zarif\n\nquestion: What was Mohammad Javad Zarif's involvement in the Iranian Consulate takeover?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1122}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This never happened \u2014 either when I was Secretary of State or since.\u201d Starting on April 27, 2021, some Republicans suggested that Kerry should resign from the Biden administration's National Security Council or were highly critical of Kerry's alleged disclosures. Other Republicans expressed uncertainty about the tape's veracity. In the tape, Zarif spoke about his relationship with Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by a United States drone strike in 2020. Zarif said that \"by assassinating  in Iraq, the United States delivered a major blow to Iran, more damaging than if it had wiped out an entire city in an attack\".\n\nquestion: What was Mohammad Javad Zarif's involvement in the Iranian Consulate takeover?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 321}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry married Dr. Brian Vala Nahed in 2009. The couple met as resident doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Nahed was born in New York. According to a New York Times announcement, the bridegroom graduated magna cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, and received his medical degree cum laude from Yale. His father, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine and critical-care physician, is the chief of staff at Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills, Calif. He also runs a private practice there, which is managed by the bridegroom\u2019s mother. Who is the Iranian in question? Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, and one of the principal negotiators in nuclear talks with the U.S. The stories allege that Zarif was the best man at Kerry\u2019s wedding, but there is no proof that this is true. The rumour started on Allen B. West\u2019s \u2013 a former one-term congressman and conservative pundit \u2013 website in July 2015: \u201cSecretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry\u2019s daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif\u2019s son.\u201d An Iranian news agency called the report a \u201cnews fabrication\u201d and said Zarif\u2019s son wasn\u2019t at the wedding. According to the report: \u201cOfficials at the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday strongly rejected some US media reports alleging that Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif\u2019s son had attended the wedding ceremony of Vanessa Kerry, the daughter of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The foreign ministry\u2019s denial came after several American websites claimed in the last few days that Zarif\u2019s son, Mehdi Zarif, had not only attended the wedding party of Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry and her Iranian American husband doctor Brian Vala Nahed, but also been Vala Nahed\u2019s best man. The report seems to have appeared on the US media not to hurt the Iranian foreign minister, but to damage Kerry\u2019s credit and reputation as the Republicans and the Israeli lobbies have started massive propaganda to torpedo a recent nuclear deal struck between the six world powers and Iran. Only the powerful Israeli lobby group, AIPAC, has declared a 20 million dollar fund for the purpose. And the Vanessa-Brian story only seems to be the beginning.\u201d The conclusion: Not only is Brian Nahed not Iranian, he wasn\u2019t born in Iran, has never held Iranian citizenship, and has never even been to Iran. He is a natural-born US citizen who has lived, attended school, and worked in the US his whole life. Furthermore, he is not close friends with either Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif or Zarif\u2019s son: he doesn\u2019t know either of them, and Zarif\u2019s son was not the best man at his wedding (nor, as some accounts report, was Zarif\u2019s son his college roommate). Vanessa Kerry herself verified that Zarif\u2019s son was not at her wedding: Persian Shrug http://t.co/BtnKMzXM27 via @po_st Happy 2 verify.

Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Mohammad Javad Zarif's Diplomatic Career and Relationships\n\nevidence: Mohammad Javad Zarif has spent more time with John Kerry than any other foreign minister He once participated in a takeover of the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco The Iranian foreign minister tweets in English If you\u2019ve been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran \u2013 if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero\u2019s welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \u201cLong live Zarif,\u201d crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \u201cpolished\u201d and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \u201cjovial.\u201d An Internet search for \u201cMohammad Javad Zarif\u201d and \u201cjovial\u201d yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: Iran/P5+1 Statement: \"The EU will TERMINATE the implementation of ALL nuclear-related economic and financial sanctions\". How about this? In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \u201cHappy Rosh Hashanah,\u201d referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \u201cThanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran\u2019s Holocaust denial, sir.\u201d And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \u201cIran never denied it,\u201d Zarif tweeted back. \u201cThe man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\u201d The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad\u2019s successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \u201cdue to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\u201d That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master\u2019s in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \u201cborn to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\u201d Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. Committed to start drafting the comprehensive nuclear deal immediately. All will be served by a serious agreement based on mutual respect. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif\u2019s name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com \u2013 which cites Zarif\u2019s memoirs, titled \u201cMr. Ambassador\u201d \u2013 was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland. \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network\n\nquestion: What was Mohammad Javad Zarif's involvement in the Iranian Consulate takeover?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "He was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco.", "usage": 1104}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was the foreign minister of Iran from 2013 until 2021 in the government of Hassan Rouhani. During his tenure as foreign minister, he led the Iranian negotiation with P5+1 countries which produced the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on 14 July 2015, lifting the economic sanctions against Iran on 16 January 2016. On 25 February 2019, Zarif resigned from his post as foreign minister. His resignation was rejected by Ali Khamenei and he continued as foreign minister. Before assuming his current position, he held various significant diplomatic and cabinet posts. He is a visiting professor at the School of International Relations and University of Tehran, teaching diplomacy and international organizations. He was the Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations from 2002 to 2007. He served as an advisor and senior advisor to the Foreign Minister, Deputy Foreign Minister in Legal and International affairs, member of the UN Eminent Persons Group on Dialogue Among Civilizations, Head of the UN Disarmament Commission in New York, and Vice President for International Affairs of the Islamic Azad University. Zarif was born in Tehran around 1960, although other sources have given the year of birth as 1959 and 1961. According to The New Republic, Zarif was born to an \"affluent, religiously devout and politically conservative merchant family in Tehran\". His father was one of the most well-known businessmen of Isfahan, and his mother Efat Kashani (d. 2013) was the daughter of one of the most famous businessmen of Tehran. He was educated at the Alavi School, a private religious institution. Zarif was shielded from TV, radio, and newspapers by his parents as a youth. There was only an alarm clock that played the Athan during prayers. Instead, he became exposed to revolutionary ideas by reading the books of Ali Shariati and Samad Behrangi. At age 17, he left Iran for the United States. Zarif attended Drew College Preparatory School, a private college-preparatory high school located in San Francisco, California. He went on to study at San Francisco State University, from which he gained a B.A. in 1981 and M.A. in 1982, both in international relations. Following this, Zarif continued his studies at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, University of Denver, from which he obtained a second M.A. in international relations in 1984 and a Ph.D. in international law and policy in 1988. His thesis was titled \"Self-Defense in International Law and Policy.\" Tom Rowe, a professor at the graduate school who led the committee that oversaw Zarif's dissertation, said: \"He was among the very best students that I've ever taught.\" Ved Nanda, who taught and was on Zarif's dissertation committee, recalled: \" good in the classroom. At that time... I thought he'd play an important part in his country's life.\" Zarif was appointed a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations in May 1982 \u2013 largely due to his English-speaking ability and relationships in America, rather than formal diplomatic training. As a junior diplomat Zarif was involved in negotiations to win the release of U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian gunmen in Lebanon, according to the memoirs of former United Nations envoy Giandomenico Picco. Even though the United States did not make a promised reciprocal goodwill gesture at the time, Zarif remained committed to improving ties. In 2000, Zarif served as chairman of the Asian preparatory meeting of the World Conference on Racism and as the chairman of the United Nations Disarmament Commission. Zarif was also professor of international law at the University of Tehran. He served as the vice president of Islamic Azad University in charge of foreign affairs from 2010 to 2012 under Abdollah Jasbi. He has served on the board of editors of a number of scholarly journals, including the Iranian Journal of International Affairs and Iranian Foreign Policy, and has written extensively on disarmament, human rights, international law, and regional conflicts. Zarif served as Iran's representative at the United Nations from 2002 to 2007. He was closely linked with developing the so-called \"Grand Bargain,\" a plan to resolve outstanding issues between the U.S. and Iran in 2003. Zarif, during his time at the UN, held private meetings with a number of Washington politicians, including the then-Senators Joseph Biden and Chuck Hagel. He resigned from office on 6 July 2007. He was succeeded by Mohammad Khazaee in the post. In 2007, Zarif was a headline speaker at an American Iranian Council conference in New Brunswick, New Jersey including Chuck Hagel, Dennis Kucinich, Nicholas Kristof,\n\nquestion: What was Mohammad Javad Zarif's involvement in the Iranian Consulate takeover?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1156}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

On 23 July 2013, it was reported that Zarif was Rouhani's choice for minister of foreign affairs. This was not confirmed by the president-elect's office until 4 August when Rouhani officially nominated Zarif for the position to the Iranian Parliament. He was confirmed by the parliament with 232 votes, replacing Ali Akbar Salehi in the position. Zarif welcomed the first visit by a foreign leader to Iran since Rouhani assumed the presidency ten days after his approval as Foreign Minister with the arrival of Oman's sultan, Qaboos bin Said Al Said. Stories spread that there was a secret agenda to his meetings with Iranian officials, involving claims that he came to convey messages from the United States and then to relay Iran's response to White House officials. On 5 September 2013, in an exchange prompted by his Rosh Hashanah greeting on Twitter, Zarif said that Iran does not deny the Holocaust, distancing the government from the often belligerent stances by former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Genuineness of Zarif's tweeting in English was confirmed by CNN's Christiane Amanpour. On 27 September 2013, he met with United States Secretary of State John Kerry during P5+1 and Iran summit. It was the highest-level direct contact between the United States and Iran in the last six years. After the meeting, Kerry said that \"We had a constructive meeting, and I think all of us were pleased that Foreign Minister Zarif came and made a presentation to us, which was very different in tone and very different in the vision that he held out with respect to possibilities of the future.\" After the breakup of talks on 12 November, Zarif rejected Kerry's claim that Iran had been unable to accept the deal \"at that particular moment\". He said \"no amount of spinning\" could change what had happened in Geneva, but it could \"further erode confidence\". Zarif appeared to blame France for \"gutting over half\" of a US draft deal. Representatives from Iran and the so-called P5+1 \u2013 met again on 20 November. Talks between senior American, Iranian and European diplomats in October 2014 produced no breakthrough agreement on curbing Iran's nuclear program, but officials said they still aimed to reach a deal by the 24 November deadline. A senior State Department official characterized each step of progress in the talks as \"chipping away\" at complex, technical differences, with virtually every sentence requiring an appendix of further explanation. \"We continue to make progress, but there is still a substantial amount of work to be done,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the difficult and secretive negotiations. Zarif and Kerry conferred, ahead of a fresh round of negotiations between Iran and six world powers in Geneva, on settling their 12-year standoff over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Lower-level negotiators on both sides met at the same venue on 15 January 2015 to iron out technical details ahead of negotiations 3 days later between Iran and the \"P5+1\" powers \u2013 the US, France, Germany, Russia, China and Britain. Speaking at a Tehran news conference, Zarif said the purpose of the talks with Kerry \"is to see if we can speed up and push the negotiations forward\". In February, Zarif said that Iran did not favor another extension of the talks on limiting its nuclear program and expected economic sanctions to be quickly lifted if an accord was reached. At a security conference in Munich, he said \"Sanctions are a liability; you need to get rid of them if you want a solution.\" Of the long effort to forge an agreement, he said \"This is the opportunity to do it, and we need to seize this opportunity. It may not be repeated.\" The nuclear talks have already been extended twice and face a late March deadline for working out the main outlines of an accord. The deadline for a detailed agreement is the end of June. Based on the Iran nuclear deal framework, which was declared on 2 April, Iran agreed to accept significant restrictions on its nuclear program for at least a decade and submit to international inspections under a framework deal. In return, international sanctions would be lifted; whether in phases or all at once still needed to be worked out. On 21 November it was reported by Iranian negotiators that progress was being made in talks in Geneva with world powers, expressing hope to bridge differences and sign an elusive deal over Tehran's nuclear drive. In statements carried by Iranian media after a one-hour meeting with Baroness Ashton, Zarif said \"Differences of opinion remain and we are negotiating over them. God willing we will reach a result.\" Three days later, the Geneva interim agreement, officially titled the Joint Plan of Action, was signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in Geneva, Switzerland. It consisted of a short-term freeze of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries worked toward a long-term agreement.

He responded, \"We do not jail people for their opinions\" Zarif condemned U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, saying the United States should be held \"accountable for crimes against humanity\". On 11 February 2019, Zarif met with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Nasrallah thanked Zarif for Iran's support of Hezbollah's fight against 'Zionist aggression', and Zarif affirmed his country's \"firm stance that supports Lebanon and its state, people and resistance\". In an interview conducted by CBS News on 25 April 2019, Zarif said that he was the one who proposed Iran's prisoner swap proposal to the U.S. government in October 2018, the proposal having been unanswered by the U.S. side up until that time. He added that the U.S. government must prove its seriousness before any negotiations. Zarif condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria viewing it as a violation of Syria's sovereignty. However regarding the US withdrawal from Syria Zarif commented saying the US was an \"irrelevant occupier in Syria\", and said that Iran would be willing to mediate tensions between Syria and Turkey. Zarif called the peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates a betrayal against Arab and non-Arab countries in the Middle East. Zarif stepped down from his post on 25 February 2019, announcing his resignation on Instagram. After greetings in honor of Iranian Women's and Mothers' day, he wrote I am apologising  you (wholeheartedly) for my (inability to continue my service and any) shortcomings in the past years during my time as foreign minister... I thank the Iranian nation and officials. Zarif did not elaborate or provide any further explanation. An aide said that one of the reasons for Zarif's resignation was anger over his exclusion that day from meetings with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who was visiting Tehran. Rouhani rejected Zarif's resignation two days later. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force, also rejected Zarif's resignation, with Soleimani remarking that Zarif is the \"main person in charge of foreign policy.\" In July 2019 the United States imposed sanctions on Zarif, and he was identified by the US as an \"illegitimate spokesperson for Iran\". In response, a spokesman for European Union diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini stated, \"We regret this decision.\" On 25 April 2021, The New York Times published content from a leaked audiotape of a three-hour taped conversation between economist Saeed Laylaz and Zarif. The taped conversation was connected to an oral history project, \"In the Islamic Republic the military field rules,\" that documents the work of Iran's current administration. The tape was obtained by the London-based news channel Iran International. In the tape, which the Times refers to as \"extraordinary\" moments, Zarif criticizes Qasem Soleimani and Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and alleges that former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told him that Israel attacked Iranian assets in Syria \"at least 200 times.\" Although the tape has not been authenticated, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman did not deny its validity. Zarif is married and has a daughter who is an interior decorator and a son who is a marketing consultant, both of whom were born in the United States. He met his wife in summer 1979 through his sister. They married in Iran but moved to New York within several weeks in the midst of the Iranian revolution. In addition to his native Persian, he is also fluent in English. Zarif has gained a domestic reputation and popularity among the people. His \"Never threaten an Iranian!\" remark, during the heated nuclear negotiations, gained attention from global news agencies. According to a poll conducted by Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC (iPOS) in March 2016, Zarif was the most popular political figure in Iran with 76% approval and 7% disapproval ratings.\n\nquestion: What was Mohammad Javad Zarif's involvement in the Iranian Consulate takeover?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 954}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif claimed in recently leaked audio that John Kerry, when he was serving as Secretary of State during the Obama administration, informed him of more than 200 Israeli operations in Syria. Kerry has previously been accused of colluding with Iranian leaders to undermine the Trump administration. Kerry is now a part of the Biden administration and has a seat on the National Security Council as the special presidential envoy for climate. Kerry shocked Zarif by revealing that Israel had attacked Iranian targets in Syria more than 200 times, according to leaked audio obtained by The New York Times and other outlets. Zarif also spoke frankly about his limited power compared to Ayatollah Ali Khameini and the blow the U.S. dealt to Iran by killing Gen. Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. IRAN\u2019S TOP DIPLOMAT, IN LEAKED RECORDING, OFFERS BLUNT COMMENTS ABOUT RUSSIA, SOLEIMANI Kerry faced criticism on Monday over Zarif's claim. \"John Kerry was ratting out Israeli covert operations in Syria directly to the Iranian foreign minister. Let that sink in. Wow,\" Noah Pollak of the foreign policy-focused Democratic Alliance Group wrote on Twitter. Former special advisor for Iran at the State Department Gabriel Noronha weighed in on Zarif's lasting political career, despite his differences with others in Iranian governnment. \"The main reason Zarif has survived as Foreign Minister for 8 years in Iran\u2019s cutthroat political environment is that he serves as the \u2018reasonable\u2019 storefront to the world, protecting the more empowered radical elements of the regime from Western and press scrutiny,\" Noronha said in a statement. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif prepares to address the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, at United Nations headquarters, Wednesday, July 17, 2019. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) \"Most of the time, Zarif\u2019s Foreign Ministry is relegated to the job of the marketing and PR team, justifying and defending the policy choices of the IRGC and Supreme Leader Khamenei abroad,\" he continued. \"I think the leak was likely instigated by regime insiders who have long hated Zarif and tried to oust him \u2014 they oppose current efforts to rejoin the JCPOA and also want to bolster domestic opposition to President Rouhani and his allies running for office in June.\" The release of the comments by Zarif set off a firestorm within Iran, where officials carefully mind their words amid a cutthroat political environment that includes the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, ultimately overseen by the country's supreme leader. Zarif has been suggested as a possible candidate for Iran's June 18 presidential election as well. In this September file photo, Secretary of State John Kerry, left, meets with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at United Nations headquarters. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) Outside of Iran, Zarif's comments could also affect talks in Vienna aimed at finding a way for Tehran and the U.S. to both come into compliance with Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Already, sabotage targeted Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz during the talks as Tehran has begun enriching a small amount of uranium up to 60% purity, which edges the country closer to weapons-grade levels. After the leak became public, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh did not dispute the tape's authenticity. He told journalists on Monday that the recording represented just a portion of a seven-hour interview Zarif gave to a well-known economist that was to be held for posterity by a think tank associated with the Iranian presidency. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Khatibzadeh called the release of the recording \"illegal\" and described it as \"selectively\" edited, though he and others did not offer opinions on how it became public. Zarif, visiting Iraq on Monday after a trip to Qatar, took no questions from journalists after giving a brief statement in Baghdad. Fox News' inquiry to the State Department was not returned at the time of publication. Fox News' Rich Edson and Nick Kalman and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

For months, Iran had been positioning itself for the transition by hosting a Taliban delegation in January and intra-Afghan peace talks in July. In August, Iran\u2019s new president, Ebrahim Raisi, hailed the U.S. withdrawal as \u201can opportunity to restore life, security and durable peace.\u201d But Iran also appeared to be caught off-guard by the Taliban\u2019s sweeping takeover and the rapid collapse of the Afghan army. Iran \u201cis concerned over the escalating violence in Afghanistan, and in light of the Taliban taking control of Herat, calls for guarantees of complete safety for its diplomatic missions and the lives of its staff,\u201d Foreign Ministry Spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh tweeted on August 13. Iran has a strategic interest in Afghanistan, regardless of who is in power. The chaotic aftermath of the Taliban\u2019s takeover held the potential to undermine Tehran\u2019s long-term concerns, including stemming the flow of migrants and refugees, containing narcotics trafficking, maintaining cross-border trade, sharing water resources, ensuring the safety of the Shiite minority, and mitigating the threat from ISIS-Khorasan. Refugees and migrants: Iran has absorbed millions of refugees since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Afghans have also historically sought seasonal work in Iran. Remittance payments, primarily from undocumented Afghan men, have long been an important part of Afghanistan\u2019s cash-strapped economy. As of 2020, Iran hosted some 950,000 documented Afghan refugees and at least 2 million more undocumented Afghans. But Iran has repeatedly tried to expel undocumented Afghans. In the first seven months of 2021, Iran deported more than 360,000 Afghans, according to the U.N. migration agency. Narcotics trafficking: Iran has blamed the Afghan government and its Western allies for failing to crack down on opium production and drug smuggling. Since 1998, Afghanistan has been the world\u2019s top opiate producer. It supplies some 80 percent of the world\u2019s opium, much of which is smuggled to Iran and on to Europe. Between 1979 and 2014, Iran claims to have lost some 4,000 security forces fighting heavily armed drug traffickers along its eastern border. Drug use is a growing domestic problem for Iran too. As of 2020, some 2.8 million Iranians were regular drug users in a population of 84 million. Another 1.6 million were recreational users. Cross-border trade: Since 2001, Iran has sought to increase exports to landlocked Afghanistan. Iran also views Afghanistan as a transportation route to expand economic ties with Central and South Asian countries. In 2017, Iran surpassed Pakistan as Afghanistan\u2019s top trade partner. Trade has largely been one-way. In 2019, Iranian exports\u2014including electricity, oil, cement, machinery, metal products, pharmaceuticals, wheat, fabrics and edible oils\u2014totaled $1.24 billion. But Afghan exports to Iran \u2013including fruit, nuts, carpets, cotton and wool \u2013 amounted to only $15 million. Between March and June 2021, 11 percent of Iran\u2019s non-oil exports went to Afghanistan. Water resources: For decades, Iran and Afghanistan have disputed how to share water resources. The Helmand River flows from the mountains of the Hindu Kush through Afghanistan into southeastern Iran, where it is critical for agriculture, fishing and human consumption. The problem in modern times dates to the 1940s and 1950s, when Afghanistan built two dams\u2014the Kajaki and the Grishk\u2014on the Helmand River that could curtail water flow into Iran. In 1973, the two countries signed a treaty on sharing water resources, which focused heavily on distribution of water from Helmand River, but the accord was neither ratified nor implemented. Subsequent Afghan governments, including the Taliban, built, repaired or upgraded dams on the Helmand. From 1998 to 2001, the Taliban closed the sluices of the Kajaki Dam, cutting off water to Iran during a drought. In 2021, Afghanistan inaugurated another dam, the Kamal Khan, on the Helmand. Amnesty International says Taliban fighters recently tortured and killed members of an ethnic minority in Afghanistan, fueling fears that they will again impose a brutal rule. https://t.co/tSvLOITUK4 The Shiite minority: Iran has long supported the Hazaras, a historically oppressed ethnic minority who make up between 10 percent and 20 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s population. Most Hazaras, like most Iranians, are Shiite. They also speak a dialect of Persian. When the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan, it carried out waves of mass killings of Hazaras in 1998, 2000 and 2001. After the Taliban fell, Iran cultivated influence among the Hazaras by funding cultural and religious activities as well as local media. In 2013, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) began recruiting Hazaras to fight in the new Fat\n\nquestion: What was Mohammad Javad Zarif's involvement in the Iranian Consulate takeover?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1140}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Over the next four years, the IRGC deployed to Syria up to 50,000 Afghans, mostly refugees who were living in Iran. The Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K): Iran has been deeply concerned about the Afghan branch of the Islamic State that emerged in 2015. ISIS-K considers Shiites apostates and has targeted them in Afghanistan. In 2020, ISIS-K gunmen allegedly killed 16 people, including infants, at a maternity hospital in a mostly Hazara neighborhood in Kabul. In December 2020, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested that the Afghan government consider regrouping Fatemiyoun fighters for the fight against ISIS-K. Iran has long supported efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. Tehran was a key player during the Bonn talks, the international diplomacy to form a new government after the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance toppled the Taliban government in 2001. The Iranian delegation, headed by then-Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, made two particularly important contributions, according to James Dobbins, the U.S. envoy. First, Iranian diplomats suggested that the Bonn agreement require the new Afghan government to commit to holding democratic elections and fighting terrorism, items that were omitted in the initial draft. Second, Zarif persuaded the Northern Alliance to give up several ministries, paving the way for the formation of Hamid Karzai\u2019s government. Iran has also invested heavily in the economic development of its eastern neighbor, the seventh poorest country in the world. At the 2002 Afghanistan Recovery and Reconstruction Conference in Tokyo, Iran pledged $560 million over five years. Iran pledged another $100 million at the 2006 London Conference. Iran helped construct roads, railways, schools, energy and water infrastructure, especially in central and northern Afghanistan. In 2011, Iran announced that it had spent $600 million on infrastructure alone. Iran funded construction of the first railway link between the two countries, a 90-mile (140 kilometer) line from Khaf in northeastern Iran to Ghoryan in western Afghanistan. The line, inaugurated in 2020, is designed to eventually extend another 53 miles to Herat, Afghanistan\u2019s third largest city. Much of Iran\u2019s investment has been focused in and around Herat. For centuries, the city has been in Iran\u2019s cultural sphere of influence. It was ruled by the Iranian Safavid dynasty from 1507 to 1716. The Iranian Qajar dynasty only relinquished its claim to Herat after losing to the British in the Anglo-Persian war of 1856-57. Iran has reprised its mediator role since Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced a road map for potential peace talks with the Taliban in November 2018. On December 26, 2018, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), visited Kabul to meet with Afghan officials. He announced that Iran had been holding talks with the Taliban in coordination with the Afghan government. Four days later, a Taliban delegation visited Tehran for talks. \u201cSince the Islamic Republic of Iran is a powerful neighbor of Afghanistan, we should discuss the future of our country with Tehran in order to take positive steps towards strengthening friendship and peace on both sides,\u201d Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told the Iranian Labour News Agency in January 2019. Iran hosted more Taliban delegations in September 2019, November 2019, January 2021 and July 2021. Iran, a predominantly Shiite country, opposed the Taliban, a Sunni movement far more rigid in its strict application of Islamic law, when it ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. In 1998, tensions between Iran and the Taliban almost escalated into war after eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist were killed by Taliban militants in northern Mazar-i-Sharif. When the Iranian nationals went missing, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the \u201cworthless and lowly\u201d Taliban had \u201cno understanding of Islam or politics.\u201d But since at least 2007, the Islamic Republic has tried to navigate a policy that includes outreach to both the elected Afghan government and the Taliban. Iran covertly armed, trained and funded the Taliban while engaging with Kabul. Tehran provided the Taliban with small arms, explosives, mortars, RPGs, heavy machine guns, and rockets, according to the Pentagon. In 2015, a Taliban delegation led by Muhammad Tayyab Agha, the head of the Taliban\u2019s political office in Qatar, visited Tehran for talks on Afghanistan and regional issues. The Taliban acknowledged that its officials had visited Iran before. In 2016, Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour secretly visited Iran for talks; he was killed in a U.S. drone strike as he returned to Pakistan. In 2019, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessed that Tehran did not want to return the Taliban to power but aimed to \u201cmaintain influence with the group as a hedge in the event that the Taliban gains a role in a\n\nquestion: What was Mohammad Javad Zarif's involvement in the Iranian Consulate takeover?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1146}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Zarif subsequently tweeted that the meeting had been \u201ccordial\u201d and promised Iran would stand with Afghans on their road to peace. After further talks on July 8, the two sides released a joint statement condemning attacks on civilians and public institutions. They agreed that \u201cwar is not the solution to the Afghanistan problem.\u201d Iran has deployed its 65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade (NOHED) in Taibad along the Afghan border amid Taliban's seizure of border crossings pic.twitter.com/9t9WfcdbCx July 9: The Taliban seized Islam Qala, a major border crossing between Iran and Afghanistan. The crossing had reportedly generated some $20 million in monthly revenue for the Afghan government. Videos circulated of Taliban fighters removing the Afghan flag from the border crossing. July 15-16: Rasoul Mousavi, the head of the west Asia department in Iran\u2019s foreign ministry, visited Kabul for talks with senior Afghan government officials, including Abdullah Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation. \u201cIran supports putting an end to the situation in Afghanistan and resolving the crisis through dialogue,\u201d Mousavi told Abdullah. \u201cOpportunities pass like clouds.

They agreed that intra-Afghan talks were the best way to stem the violence. \u201cThe international community must take an unequivocal stance in support of the political settlement for the crisis in Afghanistan and also condemn violence and its consequences,\u201d Zarif said. He also blamed foreign powers for the chaos in Afghanistan. Arnault said that Iran and other countries in the region could play a key role in supporting the peace process. Iran\u2019s special envoy for Afghanistan, Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, reiterated Tehran\u2019s support for intra-Afghan talks during a phone call with Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan\u2019s High Council for National Reconciliation. In a video circulated on social media, Iranian border guards refused to hand over Afghan army troops to the Taliban. Aug. 9: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Khatibzadeh said that Iran was in contact with the Taliban regarding border security. \u201cThere have been occasional developments at our borders, but the borders have been calm during this period with the efforts of the border guards and the courageous Army forces, Khatibzadeh said. \u201cWe have tried to send the message that Iran\u2019s borders must remain calm.\u201d Aug. 10: Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar hosted Iran\u2019s special envoy, Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, in Kabul to discuss Tehran\u2019s role in facilitating peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.

Aug. 18: Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, welcomed the U.S. departure from Afghanistan and said that Israel would eventually follow suit by withdrawing from territory claimed by Palestinians. \u201cThe end of any occupation is a humiliating dismissal. The fate that befell the United States in Vietnam, #Afghanistan and Iraq is also the inevitable fate of the occupying Zionist regime,\u201d he tweeted. Mohammad Reza Naghdi, the IRGC\u2019s deputy director of cultural and social affairs, also hailed the withdrawal. \u201cThe result of resisting against a great power is victory,\u201d he told Sepah News.

Your task is to extract a short answer from the evidence to the question. Directly answer without any explanations. If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Mohammad Javad Zarif's Diplomatic Career and Relationships\n\nevidence: About this rating On 28 July 2015, the web site of Allen B. West, a former one-term congressman and conservative pundit, published an article asserting that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had hidden a close familial connection to an Iranian official with whom he had negotiated a nuclear deal. According to that article (\"You will NOT BELIEVE who was best man at John Kerry's daughter's wedding\"), John Kerry concealed the information that his son-in-law was Iranian during the U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for his position as secretary of state. Moreover, throughout the negotiations over a deal limiting Iran's development of nuclear weapons, Kerry hid the fact that he was buddy-buddy with Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister whom he negotiated the nuclear deal \u2014 so much so that the best man at the wedding of Kerry's daughter was Zarif's son: You not might be aware that in 2009, the daughter of Secretary of State John Kerry, Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerry's younger daughter by his first wife, married an Iranian-American physician named Dr. Brian (Behrooz) Vala Nahed. Of course you're not aware of it. Brian (Behrooz) Nahed is son of Nooshin and Reza Vala Nahid of Los Angeles. Brian's Persian birth name is \"Behrooz Vala Nahid\" but it is now shortened and Americanized in the media to \"Brian Nahed.\" At the time his engagement to Bradford Kerry, there was rarely any mention of Nahed's Persian/Iranian ancestry, and even the official wedding announcement in the October 2009 issue of New York Times carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)'s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college years. Gosh, I wonder why?? Gee, do you think Secretary Kerry should have recused himself from the negotiations with Iran at the very outset because of his long-standing relationship to his Iranian counter-part, Mohammad Javad Zarif? Let me explain. Zarif is the current minister of foreign affairs in the Rouhani administration and has held various significant diplomatic and cabinet posts since the 1990s. He was Kerry's chief counterpart in the nuclear deal negotiations. Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry's daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif's son. Does this bother anyone at all? Apparently Kerry only revealed his daughter's marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of State. But the subject never came up in his Senate confirmation hearing, either because Kerry never disclosed it, or because his former colleagues were \"too polite\" to bring it up. As Front Page Magazine pointed out several months ago, the nuclear talks with Iran were a tragic farce, choreographed and orchestrated by Iran. And unfortunately, we're going to have to live with the consequences. At least, I hope we live. All of this information was wrong. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, John Kerry's daughter from his previous marriage to writer Julia Stimson Thorne (from whom he was divorced in 1988), married Brian Vala Nahed on 10 October 2009. Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he is an American-born U.S. citizen who attended school at UCLA and Yale and is currently a neurosurgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital (where his wife is also a physician specializing in critical care). This information has been plainly available for years in his official workplace biography on the Massachusetts General Hospital web site: Dr. Brian Nahed is a neurosurgeon who specializes in brain tumors (glioblastoma, gliomas, metastatic brain tumors, and meningiomas) as well as Spinal Disorders. Dr. Nahed's clinic interest are in tumors of the eloquent cortex requiring awake surgery, language and motor mapping, and subcortical stimulation. Born in New York, Dr. Nahed attended UCLA where he majored in Neuroscience, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and with the department's Highest Honors. He attended the Yale School of Medicine where he was awarded the Doris Duke Clinical Research Fellowship and graduated with honors. Dr. Nahed completed his internship and neurosurgery residency at the Massachusetts General Hospital; where Dr. Nahed also completed a postdoctoral fellowship with Drs. Daniel Haber and Shyamala Maheswaran in the MGH Cancer Center. Brian Nahed is not Iranian: he was not born in Iran, he has never held Iranian citizenship, he has never worked or lived in Iran, and he has never even been to Iran. He's a natural-born U.S. citizen from New York who has lived, attended school, and worked in the United States his whole life\n\nquestion: How is Mohammad Javad Zarif known for communicating with the international community?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1121}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Mohammad Javad Zarif's Diplomatic Career and Relationships\n\nevidence: . More important, he is not close friends with either Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif or Zarif's son: he doesn't know either of them, and Zarif's son was not the best man at his wedding (nor, as some accounts report, was Zarif's son his college roommate). Vanessa Kerry herself verified to us that Zarif's son was not at her wedding: The small piece of information here that is true is that Brian Nahed's parents were themselves born in Iran. However, they permanently left that country to immigrate to the U.S. forty years ago, well before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and now live in Los Angeles (where Brian's father also works as a physician). As for the rest of the \"facts\" presented in the Westian article, they were nothing more than a collection of supposition and innuendo, such as the claim that John Kerry \"only revealed his daughter's marriage to an Iranian-American once he had taken over as Secretary of State\" in 2013. By the article's own admission, that marriage had been very publicly covered in wedding announcement published by the New York Times in 2009, one which used the full \"Persianized\" versions of Brian's parents' names \u2014 something hardly suggestive of the notion that the media were conspiring to cover up revelation of their ancestry: The bride, who is a stepdaughter of Teresa Heinz Kerry and Richard J. Charlesworth, and the bridegroom, a son of Nooshin P. Nahed and Dr. Reza M. Nahed of Los Angeles, were married Saturday evening at Brandegee House, a Tuscan-style villa in Boston. The Right Rev. M. Thomas Shaw, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, officiated. Dr. Kerry and Dr. Nahed, both 32, are residents at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She is in her third year of a residency in internal medicine; he is in his fifth year of a residency in neurological surgery. More absurdly, the article's statement that \"even the official  wedding announcement carefully avoids any reference to Dr. Nahed (Nahid)'s birthplace (which is uncommon in wedding announcements) and starts his biography from his college years\" was deliberately misleading and specious, as that wedding announcement also made no mention of the bride's birthplace and started her biography from her college years (which is in fact quite common in wedding announcements, especially those of people who have achieved significant accomplishments in adulthood). And it makes no logical sense whatsoever that anyone attempting to hide Brian Nahed's familial connection to Iran would \"carefully avoid any reference\" to his \"foreign\" birthplace of New York. Finally, the unsourced statement that \"Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise.\" is (even if true) little more than out-of-context innuendo intended to suggest some kind of close pre-negotiation friendship between the two figures without providing any actual evidence of it. Both men have an extensive history of political and diplomatic service to their countries over the last thirty years: Mohammad Javad Zarif lived in and was educated (up to the PhD level) in the United States, served as a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations (a position in which he met with a number of Washington politicians), has been a headline speaker at foreign policy conferences in the U.S. (attended by prominent Washington politicians), and has been Iran's minister of foreign affairs since 2013, while John Kerry served several terms in the U.S. Senate, was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, chaired the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, and has been U.S. Secretary of State since 2013. It's hardly a \"surprise\" to anyone the least bit familiar with the political world that two men who have long held high positions in their countries' national governments and been closely involved with foreign affairs might have crossed paths at some point prior to their first negotiation as their countries' official representatives.

The taped conversation was connected to an oral history project, titled \"In the Islamic Republic, the military field rules,\" that documents the work of then-president Hassan Rouhani and his government. The tape was obtained by the London-based news channel Iran International and publicized by The New York Times. Zarif did not dispute the authenticity of the leaked tape, but questioned the motive. Iran International noted that Zarif's claim was \"not very credible.\" Although the tape has not been authenticated, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman did not deny its validity, and critics of Zarif were calling for his resignation, saying that \"he had threatened Iran\u2019s national security by revealing to the world the country\u2019s inner politics\". Iran's president Hassan Rouhani ordered an investigation to identify who leaked the tape. He stated that it was \"stolen for clear reasons\". On May 2, 2021, in an Instagram post, Zarif apologized for the remarks that he made against Soleimani. In the tape, Zarif said former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told him that Israel attacked Iranian assets in Syria \"at least 200 times.\" Zarif said that he was astonished by the admission. Kerry was not recorded speaking on the tape, and the date of the recording is unknown. A posting on Iran International's website indicated that Zarif was taken aback, that it was not the IRGC who informed him about the Israeli strikes against Iran, but Kerry. NBC reported that the leaked tape \"inflamed a debate raging in Iran over the nuclear deal\" with upcoming presidential elections. Also, its effects in the US where \"Republican opponents of nuclear diplomacy with Iran have seized on Zarif's account\". On September 27, 2013, Kerry met with Zarif during the P5+1 and Iran summit, which eventually led to the JCPOA nuclear agreement. It was the highest-level direct contact between the United States and Iran in the last six years, and it made Kerry the first U.S. Secretary of State to have met with his Iranian counterpart since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. In April 2021, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State Ned Price stated in a press briefing that he couldn't confirm the accuracy or authenticity of the Zarif audiotape or its claims, but implied that Kerry would not have likely been disclosing confidential information if it occurred. He stated that prior press reporting of Israeli attacks on Syria would have made the suspected call contents already part of the public record, making Kerry's alleged disclosures to Zarif as not confidential. As CNN noted, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed in July 2017 that Israeli airstrikes had targeted Iranian-backed Hezbollah-bound convoys in Syria \"dozens of times\", and in August 2017, Israeli Air Force chief Maj. Gen. Amir Eshel confirmed that Israel had attacked convoys bringing arms to Hezbollah several times over the past five years. In 2018, Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz stated that \"in the last two years Israel has taken military action  more than 200 times within Syria itself.\" However, it is unclear whether Kerry allegedly revealed the Israeli operations to Zarif before or after Israel itself publicly reported them in 2018. In May 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported that then-President Donald Trump said that Kerry \u201cshould be prosecuted\u201d for meeting privately with Iranian officials. Nineteen Republican senators signed a letter asking President Joe Biden to investigate the Zarif claim, writing: \"We write to convey our grave concerns over U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry\u2019s position as a member of your administration's National Security Council and his record \u2013 both past and present \u2013 of potentially working with America\u2019s adversaries against our national security interests and those of our allies. We ask you to investigate recent allegations that Secretary Kerry revealed sensitive information to the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, and if true, call for his removal from your national security team.\" Three Republican representatives, Ann Wagner, Andy Barr, and Lee Zeldin, sent a letter to Diana Shaw, the State Department's acting inspector general, asking for a full investigation into Zarif's claims. In the letter they wrote, \u201cGiven the gravity of the security threat Iran poses to U.S. and Israeli interests, we respectfully ask that you fully investigate these allegations...Iran is a serious threat to Israel, a bulwark of democracy and stability in the Middle East. It is in our national security interest to stand by our strategic ally - not sell it out to our adversaries\u201d. The letter also requested that Shaw make a determination if Kerry should have his security clearance revoked. The lawmakers inquired what role Kerry had in formulating the Biden administration's policy on re-entering the JCPOA. They also questioned whether the state department knew of any Iranian proxy \u201cfollow-on attacks\u201d made against Israel after Kerry allegedly met with Zarif\n\nquestion: How is Mohammad Javad Zarif known for communicating with the international community?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "He communicated with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry during the P5+1 and Iran summit that led to the JCPOA nuclear agreement.", "usage": 1149}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In May 2021, Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee requested documents from the White House regarding Kerry's security clearance.

In a tweet, Kerry denied Zarif's account, writing: \u201cI can tell you that this story and these allegations are unequivocally false. This never happened \u2014 either when I was Secretary of State or since.\u201d Starting on April 27, 2021, some Republicans suggested that Kerry should resign from the Biden administration's National Security Council or were highly critical of Kerry's alleged disclosures. Other Republicans expressed uncertainty about the tape's veracity. In the tape, Zarif spoke about his relationship with Qasem Soleimani, who was killed by a United States drone strike in 2020. Zarif said that \"by assassinating  in Iraq, the United States delivered a major blow to Iran, more damaging than if it had wiped out an entire city in an attack\".\n\nquestion: How is Mohammad Javad Zarif known for communicating with the international community?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 320}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry married Dr. Brian Vala Nahed in 2009. The couple met as resident doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Nahed was born in New York. According to a New York Times announcement, the bridegroom graduated magna cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, and received his medical degree cum laude from Yale. His father, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine and critical-care physician, is the chief of staff at Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills, Calif. He also runs a private practice there, which is managed by the bridegroom\u2019s mother. Who is the Iranian in question? Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, and one of the principal negotiators in nuclear talks with the U.S. The stories allege that Zarif was the best man at Kerry\u2019s wedding, but there is no proof that this is true. The rumour started on Allen B. West\u2019s \u2013 a former one-term congressman and conservative pundit \u2013 website in July 2015: \u201cSecretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a decade ago at a dinner party hosted by George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the best man at the 2009 wedding between Kerry\u2019s daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala Nahed? Javad Zarif\u2019s son.\u201d An Iranian news agency called the report a \u201cnews fabrication\u201d and said Zarif\u2019s son wasn\u2019t at the wedding. According to the report: \u201cOfficials at the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday strongly rejected some US media reports alleging that Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif\u2019s son had attended the wedding ceremony of Vanessa Kerry, the daughter of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The foreign ministry\u2019s denial came after several American websites claimed in the last few days that Zarif\u2019s son, Mehdi Zarif, had not only attended the wedding party of Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry and her Iranian American husband doctor Brian Vala Nahed, but also been Vala Nahed\u2019s best man. The report seems to have appeared on the US media not to hurt the Iranian foreign minister, but to damage Kerry\u2019s credit and reputation as the Republicans and the Israeli lobbies have started massive propaganda to torpedo a recent nuclear deal struck between the six world powers and Iran. Only the powerful Israeli lobby group, AIPAC, has declared a 20 million dollar fund for the purpose. And the Vanessa-Brian story only seems to be the beginning.\u201d The conclusion: Not only is Brian Nahed not Iranian, he wasn\u2019t born in Iran, has never held Iranian citizenship, and has never even been to Iran. He is a natural-born US citizen who has lived, attended school, and worked in the US his whole life. Furthermore, he is not close friends with either Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif or Zarif\u2019s son: he doesn\u2019t know either of them, and Zarif\u2019s son was not the best man at his wedding (nor, as some accounts report, was Zarif\u2019s son his college roommate).

He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran \u2013 if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero\u2019s welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \u201cLong live Zarif,\u201d crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \u201cpolished\u201d and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \u201cjovial.\u201d An Internet search for \u201cMohammad Javad Zarif\u201d and \u201cjovial\u201d yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: Iran/P5+1 Statement: \"The EU will TERMINATE the implementation of ALL nuclear-related economic and financial sanctions\". How about this? In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \u201cHappy Rosh Hashanah,\u201d referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \u201cThanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran\u2019s Holocaust denial, sir.\u201d And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \u201cIran never denied it,\u201d Zarif tweeted back. \u201cThe man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\u201d The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad\u2019s successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \u201cdue to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\u201d That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master\u2019s in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \u201cborn to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\u201d Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. Committed to start drafting the comprehensive nuclear deal immediately. All will be served by a serious agreement based on mutual respect. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif\u2019s name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com \u2013 which cites Zarif\u2019s memoirs, titled \u201cMr. Ambassador\u201d \u2013 was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland. \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network\n\nquestion: How is Mohammad Javad Zarif known for communicating with the international community?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "He tweets in English.", "usage": 1092}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was the foreign minister of Iran from 2013 until 2021 in the government of Hassan Rouhani. During his tenure as foreign minister, he led the Iranian negotiation with P5+1 countries which produced the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on 14 July 2015, lifting the economic sanctions against Iran on 16 January 2016. On 25 February 2019, Zarif resigned from his post as foreign minister. His resignation was rejected by Ali Khamenei and he continued as foreign minister. Before assuming his current position, he held various significant diplomatic and cabinet posts. He is a visiting professor at the School of International Relations and University of Tehran, teaching diplomacy and international organizations. He was the Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations from 2002 to 2007. He served as an advisor and senior advisor to the Foreign Minister, Deputy Foreign Minister in Legal and International affairs, member of the UN Eminent Persons Group on Dialogue Among Civilizations, Head of the UN Disarmament Commission in New York, and Vice President for International Affairs of the Islamic Azad University. Zarif was born in Tehran around 1960, although other sources have given the year of birth as 1959 and 1961. According to The New Republic, Zarif was born to an \"affluent, religiously devout and politically conservative merchant family in Tehran\". His father was one of the most well-known businessmen of Isfahan, and his mother Efat Kashani (d. 2013) was the daughter of one of the most famous businessmen of Tehran. He was educated at the Alavi School, a private religious institution. Zarif was shielded from TV, radio, and newspapers by his parents as a youth. There was only an alarm clock that played the Athan during prayers. Instead, he became exposed to revolutionary ideas by reading the books of Ali Shariati and Samad Behrangi. At age 17, he left Iran for the United States. Zarif attended Drew College Preparatory School, a private college-preparatory high school located in San Francisco, California. He went on to study at San Francisco State University, from which he gained a B.A. in 1981 and M.A. in 1982, both in international relations. Following this, Zarif continued his studies at the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, University of Denver, from which he obtained a second M.A. in international relations in 1984 and a Ph.D. in international law and policy in 1988. His thesis was titled \"Self-Defense in International Law and Policy.\" Tom Rowe, a professor at the graduate school who led the committee that oversaw Zarif's dissertation, said: \"He was among the very best students that I've ever taught.\" Ved Nanda, who taught and was on Zarif's dissertation committee, recalled: \" good in the classroom. At that time... I thought he'd play an important part in his country's life.\" Zarif was appointed a member of the Iranian delegation to the United Nations in May 1982 \u2013 largely due to his English-speaking ability and relationships in America, rather than formal diplomatic training. As a junior diplomat Zarif was involved in negotiations to win the release of U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian gunmen in Lebanon, according to the memoirs of former United Nations envoy Giandomenico Picco. Even though the United States did not make a promised reciprocal goodwill gesture at the time, Zarif remained committed to improving ties. In 2000, Zarif served as chairman of the Asian preparatory meeting of the World Conference on Racism and as the chairman of the United Nations Disarmament Commission. Zarif was also professor of international law at the University of Tehran. He served as the vice president of Islamic Azad University in charge of foreign affairs from 2010 to 2012 under Abdollah Jasbi. He has served on the board of editors of a number of scholarly journals, including the Iranian Journal of International Affairs and Iranian Foreign Policy, and has written extensively on disarmament, human rights, international law, and regional conflicts. Zarif served as Iran's representative at the United Nations from 2002 to 2007. He was closely linked with developing the so-called \"Grand Bargain,\" a plan to resolve outstanding issues between the U.S. and Iran in 2003. Zarif, during his time at the UN, held private meetings with a number of Washington politicians, including the then-Senators Joseph Biden and Chuck Hagel. He resigned from office on 6 July 2007. He was succeeded by Mohammad Khazaee in the post. In 2007, Zarif was a headline speaker at an American Iranian Council conference in New Brunswick, New Jersey including Chuck Hagel, Dennis Kucinich, Nicholas Kristof,\n\nquestion: How is Mohammad Javad Zarif known for communicating with the international community?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Zarif was involved in negotiations to win the release of U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian gunmen in Lebanon.", "usage": 1179}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

On 23 July 2013, it was reported that Zarif was Rouhani's choice for minister of foreign affairs. This was not confirmed by the president-elect's office until 4 August when Rouhani officially nominated Zarif for the position to the Iranian Parliament. He was confirmed by the parliament with 232 votes, replacing Ali Akbar Salehi in the position. Zarif welcomed the first visit by a foreign leader to Iran since Rouhani assumed the presidency ten days after his approval as Foreign Minister with the arrival of Oman's sultan, Qaboos bin Said Al Said. Stories spread that there was a secret agenda to his meetings with Iranian officials, involving claims that he came to convey messages from the United States and then to relay Iran's response to White House officials. On 5 September 2013, in an exchange prompted by his Rosh Hashanah greeting on Twitter, Zarif said that Iran does not deny the Holocaust, distancing the government from the often belligerent stances by former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Genuineness of Zarif's tweeting in English was confirmed by CNN's Christiane Amanpour. On 27 September 2013, he met with United States Secretary of State John Kerry during P5+1 and Iran summit. It was the highest-level direct contact between the United States and Iran in the last six years. After the meeting, Kerry said that \"We had a constructive meeting, and I think all of us were pleased that Foreign Minister Zarif came and made a presentation to us, which was very different in tone and very different in the vision that he held out with respect to possibilities of the future.\" After the breakup of talks on 12 November, Zarif rejected Kerry's claim that Iran had been unable to accept the deal \"at that particular moment\". He said \"no amount of spinning\" could change what had happened in Geneva, but it could \"further erode confidence\". Zarif appeared to blame France for \"gutting over half\" of a US draft deal. Representatives from Iran and the so-called P5+1 \u2013 met again on 20 November. Talks between senior American, Iranian and European diplomats in October 2014 produced no breakthrough agreement on curbing Iran's nuclear program, but officials said they still aimed to reach a deal by the 24 November deadline. A senior State Department official characterized each step of progress in the talks as \"chipping away\" at complex, technical differences, with virtually every sentence requiring an appendix of further explanation. \"We continue to make progress, but there is still a substantial amount of work to be done,\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the difficult and secretive negotiations. Zarif and Kerry conferred, ahead of a fresh round of negotiations between Iran and six world powers in Geneva, on settling their 12-year standoff over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Lower-level negotiators on both sides met at the same venue on 15 January 2015 to iron out technical details ahead of negotiations 3 days later between Iran and the \"P5+1\" powers \u2013 the US, France, Germany, Russia, China and Britain. Speaking at a Tehran news conference, Zarif said the purpose of the talks with Kerry \"is to see if we can speed up and push the negotiations forward\". In February, Zarif said that Iran did not favor another extension of the talks on limiting its nuclear program and expected economic sanctions to be quickly lifted if an accord was reached. At a security conference in Munich, he said \"Sanctions are a liability; you need to get rid of them if you want a solution.\" Of the long effort to forge an agreement, he said \"This is the opportunity to do it, and we need to seize this opportunity. It may not be repeated.\" The nuclear talks have already been extended twice and face a late March deadline for working out the main outlines of an accord. The deadline for a detailed agreement is the end of June. Based on the Iran nuclear deal framework, which was declared on 2 April, Iran agreed to accept significant restrictions on its nuclear program for at least a decade and submit to international inspections under a framework deal. In return, international sanctions would be lifted; whether in phases or all at once still needed to be worked out. On 21 November it was reported by Iranian negotiators that progress was being made in talks in Geneva with world powers, expressing hope to bridge differences and sign an elusive deal over Tehran's nuclear drive. In statements carried by Iranian media after a one-hour meeting with Baroness Ashton, Zarif said \"Differences of opinion remain and we are negotiating over them. God willing we will reach a result.\" Three days later, the Geneva interim agreement, officially titled the Joint Plan of Action, was signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in Geneva, Switzerland. It consisted of a short-term freeze of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries worked toward a long-term agreement.

He responded, \"We do not jail people for their opinions\" Zarif condemned U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, saying the United States should be held \"accountable for crimes against humanity\". On 11 February 2019, Zarif met with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. Nasrallah thanked Zarif for Iran's support of Hezbollah's fight against 'Zionist aggression', and Zarif affirmed his country's \"firm stance that supports Lebanon and its state, people and resistance\". In an interview conducted by CBS News on 25 April 2019, Zarif said that he was the one who proposed Iran's prisoner swap proposal to the U.S. government in October 2018, the proposal having been unanswered by the U.S. side up until that time. He added that the U.S. government must prove its seriousness before any negotiations. Zarif condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria viewing it as a violation of Syria's sovereignty. However regarding the US withdrawal from Syria Zarif commented saying the US was an \"irrelevant occupier in Syria\", and said that Iran would be willing to mediate tensions between Syria and Turkey. Zarif called the peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates a betrayal against Arab and non-Arab countries in the Middle East. Zarif stepped down from his post on 25 February 2019, announcing his resignation on Instagram. After greetings in honor of Iranian Women's and Mothers' day, he wrote I am apologising  you (wholeheartedly) for my (inability to continue my service and any) shortcomings in the past years during my time as foreign minister... I thank the Iranian nation and officials. Zarif did not elaborate or provide any further explanation. An aide said that one of the reasons for Zarif's resignation was anger over his exclusion that day from meetings with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who was visiting Tehran. Rouhani rejected Zarif's resignation two days later. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force, also rejected Zarif's resignation, with Soleimani remarking that Zarif is the \"main person in charge of foreign policy.\" In July 2019 the United States imposed sanctions on Zarif, and he was identified by the US as an \"illegitimate spokesperson for Iran\". In response, a spokesman for European Union diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini stated, \"We regret this decision.\" On 25 April 2021, The New York Times published content from a leaked audiotape of a three-hour taped conversation between economist Saeed Laylaz and Zarif. The taped conversation was connected to an oral history project, \"In the Islamic Republic the military field rules,\" that documents the work of Iran's current administration. The tape was obtained by the London-based news channel Iran International. In the tape, which the Times refers to as \"extraordinary\" moments, Zarif criticizes Qasem Soleimani and Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and alleges that former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told him that Israel attacked Iranian assets in Syria \"at least 200 times.\" Although the tape has not been authenticated, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman did not deny its validity. Zarif is married and has a daughter who is an interior decorator and a son who is a marketing consultant, both of whom were born in the United States. He met his wife in summer 1979 through his sister. They married in Iran but moved to New York within several weeks in the midst of the Iranian revolution. In addition to his native Persian, he is also fluent in English. Zarif has gained a domestic reputation and popularity among the people. His \"Never threaten an Iranian!\" remark, during the heated nuclear negotiations, gained attention from global news agencies. According to a poll conducted by Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC (iPOS) in March 2016, Zarif was the most popular political figure in Iran with 76% approval and 7% disapproval ratings.\n\nquestion: How is Mohammad Javad Zarif known for communicating with the international community?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Mohammad Javad Zarif is known for condemning U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, proposing Iran's prisoner swap proposal to the U.S. government, and calling the peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates a betrayal against Arab and non-Arab countries in the Middle East.", "usage": 1013}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif claimed in recently leaked audio that John Kerry, when he was serving as Secretary of State during the Obama administration, informed him of more than 200 Israeli operations in Syria. Kerry has previously been accused of colluding with Iranian leaders to undermine the Trump administration. Kerry is now a part of the Biden administration and has a seat on the National Security Council as the special presidential envoy for climate. Kerry shocked Zarif by revealing that Israel had attacked Iranian targets in Syria more than 200 times, according to leaked audio obtained by The New York Times and other outlets. Zarif also spoke frankly about his limited power compared to Ayatollah Ali Khameini and the blow the U.S. dealt to Iran by killing Gen. Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. IRAN\u2019S TOP DIPLOMAT, IN LEAKED RECORDING, OFFERS BLUNT COMMENTS ABOUT RUSSIA, SOLEIMANI Kerry faced criticism on Monday over Zarif's claim. \"John Kerry was ratting out Israeli covert operations in Syria directly to the Iranian foreign minister. Let that sink in. Wow,\" Noah Pollak of the foreign policy-focused Democratic Alliance Group wrote on Twitter. Former special advisor for Iran at the State Department Gabriel Noronha weighed in on Zarif's lasting political career, despite his differences with others in Iranian governnment. \"The main reason Zarif has survived as Foreign Minister for 8 years in Iran\u2019s cutthroat political environment is that he serves as the \u2018reasonable\u2019 storefront to the world, protecting the more empowered radical elements of the regime from Western and press scrutiny,\" Noronha said in a statement. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif prepares to address the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, at United Nations headquarters, Wednesday, July 17, 2019. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) \"Most of the time, Zarif\u2019s Foreign Ministry is relegated to the job of the marketing and PR team, justifying and defending the policy choices of the IRGC and Supreme Leader Khamenei abroad,\" he continued. \"I think the leak was likely instigated by regime insiders who have long hated Zarif and tried to oust him \u2014 they oppose current efforts to rejoin the JCPOA and also want to bolster domestic opposition to President Rouhani and his allies running for office in June.\" The release of the comments by Zarif set off a firestorm within Iran, where officials carefully mind their words amid a cutthroat political environment that includes the powerful paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, ultimately overseen by the country's supreme leader. Zarif has been suggested as a possible candidate for Iran's June 18 presidential election as well. In this September file photo, Secretary of State John Kerry, left, meets with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at United Nations headquarters. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) Outside of Iran, Zarif's comments could also affect talks in Vienna aimed at finding a way for Tehran and the U.S. to both come into compliance with Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Already, sabotage targeted Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz during the talks as Tehran has begun enriching a small amount of uranium up to 60% purity, which edges the country closer to weapons-grade levels. After the leak became public, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh did not dispute the tape's authenticity. He told journalists on Monday that the recording represented just a portion of a seven-hour interview Zarif gave to a well-known economist that was to be held for posterity by a think tank associated with the Iranian presidency. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Khatibzadeh called the release of the recording \"illegal\" and described it as \"selectively\" edited, though he and others did not offer opinions on how it became public. Zarif, visiting Iraq on Monday after a trip to Qatar, took no questions from journalists after giving a brief statement in Baghdad.

For months, Iran had been positioning itself for the transition by hosting a Taliban delegation in January and intra-Afghan peace talks in July. In August, Iran\u2019s new president, Ebrahim Raisi, hailed the U.S. withdrawal as \u201can opportunity to restore life, security and durable peace.\u201d But Iran also appeared to be caught off-guard by the Taliban\u2019s sweeping takeover and the rapid collapse of the Afghan army. Iran \u201cis concerned over the escalating violence in Afghanistan, and in light of the Taliban taking control of Herat, calls for guarantees of complete safety for its diplomatic missions and the lives of its staff,\u201d Foreign Ministry Spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh tweeted on August 13. Iran has a strategic interest in Afghanistan, regardless of who is in power. The chaotic aftermath of the Taliban\u2019s takeover held the potential to undermine Tehran\u2019s long-term concerns, including stemming the flow of migrants and refugees, containing narcotics trafficking, maintaining cross-border trade, sharing water resources, ensuring the safety of the Shiite minority, and mitigating the threat from ISIS-Khorasan. Refugees and migrants: Iran has absorbed millions of refugees since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Afghans have also historically sought seasonal work in Iran. Remittance payments, primarily from undocumented Afghan men, have long been an important part of Afghanistan\u2019s cash-strapped economy. As of 2020, Iran hosted some 950,000 documented Afghan refugees and at least 2 million more undocumented Afghans. But Iran has repeatedly tried to expel undocumented Afghans. In the first seven months of 2021, Iran deported more than 360,000 Afghans, according to the U.N. migration agency. Narcotics trafficking: Iran has blamed the Afghan government and its Western allies for failing to crack down on opium production and drug smuggling. Since 1998, Afghanistan has been the world\u2019s top opiate producer. It supplies some 80 percent of the world\u2019s opium, much of which is smuggled to Iran and on to Europe. Between 1979 and 2014, Iran claims to have lost some 4,000 security forces fighting heavily armed drug traffickers along its eastern border. Drug use is a growing domestic problem for Iran too. As of 2020, some 2.8 million Iranians were regular drug users in a population of 84 million. Another 1.6 million were recreational users. Cross-border trade: Since 2001, Iran has sought to increase exports to landlocked Afghanistan. Iran also views Afghanistan as a transportation route to expand economic ties with Central and South Asian countries. In 2017, Iran surpassed Pakistan as Afghanistan\u2019s top trade partner. Trade has largely been one-way. In 2019, Iranian exports\u2014including electricity, oil, cement, machinery, metal products, pharmaceuticals, wheat, fabrics and edible oils\u2014totaled $1.24 billion. But Afghan exports to Iran \u2013including fruit, nuts, carpets, cotton and wool \u2013 amounted to only $15 million. Between March and June 2021, 11 percent of Iran\u2019s non-oil exports went to Afghanistan. Water resources: For decades, Iran and Afghanistan have disputed how to share water resources. The Helmand River flows from the mountains of the Hindu Kush through Afghanistan into southeastern Iran, where it is critical for agriculture, fishing and human consumption. The problem in modern times dates to the 1940s and 1950s, when Afghanistan built two dams\u2014the Kajaki and the Grishk\u2014on the Helmand River that could curtail water flow into Iran. In 1973, the two countries signed a treaty on sharing water resources, which focused heavily on distribution of water from Helmand River, but the accord was neither ratified nor implemented. Subsequent Afghan governments, including the Taliban, built, repaired or upgraded dams on the Helmand. From 1998 to 2001, the Taliban closed the sluices of the Kajaki Dam, cutting off water to Iran during a drought. In 2021, Afghanistan inaugurated another dam, the Kamal Khan, on the Helmand. Amnesty International says Taliban fighters recently tortured and killed members of an ethnic minority in Afghanistan, fueling fears that they will again impose a brutal rule. https://t.co/tSvLOITUK4 The Shiite minority: Iran has long supported the Hazaras, a historically oppressed ethnic minority who make up between 10 percent and 20 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s population. Most Hazaras, like most Iranians, are Shiite. They also speak a dialect of Persian. When the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan, it carried out waves of mass killings of Hazaras in 1998, 2000 and 2001. After the Taliban fell, Iran cultivated influence among the Hazaras by funding cultural and religious activities as well as local media. In 2013, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) began recruiting Hazaras to fight in the new Fat\n\nquestion: How is Mohammad Javad Zarif known for communicating with the international community?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1139}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Over the next four years, the IRGC deployed to Syria up to 50,000 Afghans, mostly refugees who were living in Iran. The Islamic State-Khorasan (ISIS-K): Iran has been deeply concerned about the Afghan branch of the Islamic State that emerged in 2015. ISIS-K considers Shiites apostates and has targeted them in Afghanistan. In 2020, ISIS-K gunmen allegedly killed 16 people, including infants, at a maternity hospital in a mostly Hazara neighborhood in Kabul. In December 2020, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested that the Afghan government consider regrouping Fatemiyoun fighters for the fight against ISIS-K. Iran has long supported efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. Tehran was a key player during the Bonn talks, the international diplomacy to form a new government after the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance toppled the Taliban government in 2001. The Iranian delegation, headed by then-Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, made two particularly important contributions, according to James Dobbins, the U.S. envoy. First, Iranian diplomats suggested that the Bonn agreement require the new Afghan government to commit to holding democratic elections and fighting terrorism, items that were omitted in the initial draft. Second, Zarif persuaded the Northern Alliance to give up several ministries, paving the way for the formation of Hamid Karzai\u2019s government. Iran has also invested heavily in the economic development of its eastern neighbor, the seventh poorest country in the world. At the 2002 Afghanistan Recovery and Reconstruction Conference in Tokyo, Iran pledged $560 million over five years. Iran pledged another $100 million at the 2006 London Conference. Iran helped construct roads, railways, schools, energy and water infrastructure, especially in central and northern Afghanistan. In 2011, Iran announced that it had spent $600 million on infrastructure alone. Iran funded construction of the first railway link between the two countries, a 90-mile (140 kilometer) line from Khaf in northeastern Iran to Ghoryan in western Afghanistan. The line, inaugurated in 2020, is designed to eventually extend another 53 miles to Herat, Afghanistan\u2019s third largest city. Much of Iran\u2019s investment has been focused in and around Herat. For centuries, the city has been in Iran\u2019s cultural sphere of influence. It was ruled by the Iranian Safavid dynasty from 1507 to 1716. The Iranian Qajar dynasty only relinquished its claim to Herat after losing to the British in the Anglo-Persian war of 1856-57. Iran has reprised its mediator role since Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announced a road map for potential peace talks with the Taliban in November 2018. On December 26, 2018, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), visited Kabul to meet with Afghan officials. He announced that Iran had been holding talks with the Taliban in coordination with the Afghan government. Four days later, a Taliban delegation visited Tehran for talks. \u201cSince the Islamic Republic of Iran is a powerful neighbor of Afghanistan, we should discuss the future of our country with Tehran in order to take positive steps towards strengthening friendship and peace on both sides,\u201d Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told the Iranian Labour News Agency in January 2019. Iran hosted more Taliban delegations in September 2019, November 2019, January 2021 and July 2021. Iran, a predominantly Shiite country, opposed the Taliban, a Sunni movement far more rigid in its strict application of Islamic law, when it ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. In 1998, tensions between Iran and the Taliban almost escalated into war after eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist were killed by Taliban militants in northern Mazar-i-Sharif. When the Iranian nationals went missing, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the \u201cworthless and lowly\u201d Taliban had \u201cno understanding of Islam or politics.\u201d But since at least 2007, the Islamic Republic has tried to navigate a policy that includes outreach to both the elected Afghan government and the Taliban. Iran covertly armed, trained and funded the Taliban while engaging with Kabul. Tehran provided the Taliban with small arms, explosives, mortars, RPGs, heavy machine guns, and rockets, according to the Pentagon. In 2015, a Taliban delegation led by Muhammad Tayyab Agha, the head of the Taliban\u2019s political office in Qatar, visited Tehran for talks on Afghanistan and regional issues. The Taliban acknowledged that its officials had visited Iran before. In 2016, Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour secretly visited Iran for talks; he was killed in a U.S. drone strike as he returned to Pakistan. In 2019, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessed that Tehran did not want to return the Taliban to power but aimed to \u201cmaintain influence with the group as a hedge in the event that the Taliban gains a role in a\n\nquestion: How is Mohammad Javad Zarif known for communicating with the international community?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "He served as Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister and was a key player in the international diplomacy to form a new government in Afghanistan after the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance toppled the Taliban government in 2001.", "usage": 1186}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

They agreed that intra-Afghan talks were the best way to stem the violence. \u201cThe international community must take an unequivocal stance in support of the political settlement for the crisis in Afghanistan and also condemn violence and its consequences,\u201d Zarif said. He also blamed foreign powers for the chaos in Afghanistan. Arnault said that Iran and other countries in the region could play a key role in supporting the peace process. Iran\u2019s special envoy for Afghanistan, Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, reiterated Tehran\u2019s support for intra-Afghan talks during a phone call with Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan\u2019s High Council for National Reconciliation.
