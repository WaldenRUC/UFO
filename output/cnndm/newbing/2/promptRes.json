China is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its \"Strike Hard\" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of Xinjiang. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013. Amnesty's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in China, where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret. Belarus and Vietnam, too, do not release data on death penalty cases. \"The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide),\" Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty's Director of Global Issues, told CNN. \"A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition.\" While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including Egypt and Nigeria, \"against scores of people in some cases.\" The organization found \"positive developments\" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions. Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the Middle East and North Africa were down 23% compared to 2013. \"Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments... I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments,\" Gaughran said. \"Across the board, with the exception of Europe and Central Asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region.\" The resumption of the use of capital punishment in Belarus -- the only country in Europe and Central Asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region. The United States has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the Americas to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014. The state of Washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year. The U.S. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only Iran (289+), Iraq (61+), and Saudi Arabia (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available, Amnesty estimates that China also executes \"thousands\" of prisoners each year, \"more than the rest of the world put together.\" The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. \"In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards,\" the report stated. \"In 2014 Amnesty International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka.\" The United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment. \"The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another,\" he said, in marking World Day against Death Penalty in October. \"We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights.\" Amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.\n\n\nquestion: How many countries recorded commutations or pardons of death sentences?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1069}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This figure represents the highest number of executions that Amnesty International has recorded in the past five years (since 2017, when 993 executions were recorded). China remained the world\u2019s leading executioner, but the true extent of the use of the death penalty in this country remains unknown as this data remains classified as a state secret. The global figure recorded by Amnesty International excludes the thousands of executions believed to have been carried out in China, as well as those carried out in Viet Nam and North Korea where Amnesty International believes the death penalty was resorted to extensively. Most known executions took place in China (1000s), Iran (at least 576) Saudi Arabia (196), Egypt (24), and the USA (18). In 2022, 93% of known global executions (excluding China) were carried out in the Middle East and North Africa.

Last year saw a worrying rise in executions and death sentences in some countries after earlier Covid-19 restrictions were removed from courts. Amnesty\u2019s Report, Death Sentences and Executions 2021, is an authoritative annual survey on the death penalty and shows that at least 579 executions were known to have been carried out in 18 countries last year\u2060, a 20% increase on the recorded total for 2020\u2060. As in previous years, the data does not include the thousands of people Amnesty believes were executed in China, as well as the significant number of executions thought to have taken place in North Korea and Vietnam. State secrecy in these countries make it impossible to accurately monitor executions. Amnesty\u2019s report also emphasises that some of the figures should be regarded as minimum figures. One disturbing trend was the effect of a lifting of earlier Covid-19 restrictions on judicial buildings including courts in various countries. With these steadily re-opening during 2021, judges handed down at least 2,052 death sentences in 56 countries - almost 40% more than in 2020. Overall, by the end of last year at least 28,670 people were under sentence of death around the world. However, Amnesty\u2019s report also shows that an underlying long-term trend toward reduced use of capital punishment continued during 2021, with the yearly death toll of 573 making it the second-lowest (after 2020) recorded by Amnesty since at least 2010. In the USA, 2021 saw the lowest number of executions (11) since 1988, while Virginia became the 23rd state - and first southern state - to abolish the death penalty, and the Biden administration established a temporary moratorium on federal executions in July. The minority of countries that still retain the death penalty are on notice: a world without state-sanctioned killing is not only imaginable - it is within reach and we will continue to fight for it. - Agn\u00e8s Callamard, Amnesty International\u2019s Secretary General Read the full report below.

Last year saw a worrying rise in executions and death sentences in some countries after earlier Covid-19 restrictions were removed from courts. Amnesty\u2019s Report, Death Sentences and Executions 2021, is an authoritative annual survey on the death penalty and shows that at least 579 executions were known to have been carried out in 18 countries last year\u2060, a 20% increase on the recorded total for 2020\u2060. As in previous years, the data does not include the thousands of people Amnesty believes were executed in China, as well as the significant number of executions thought to have taken place in North Korea and Vietnam. State secrecy in these countries make it impossible to accurately monitor executions. Amnesty\u2019s report also emphasises that some of the figures should be regarded as minimum figures. One disturbing trend was the effect of a lifting of earlier Covid-19 restrictions on judicial buildings including courts in various countries. With these steadily re-opening during 2021, judges handed down at least 2,052 death sentences in 56 countries - almost 40% more than in 2020. Overall, by the end of last year at least 28,670 people were under sentence of death around the world. However, Amnesty\u2019s report also shows that an underlying long-term trend toward reduced use of capital punishment continued during 2021, with the yearly death toll of 573 making it the second-lowest (after 2020) recorded by Amnesty since at least 2010. In the USA, 2021 saw the lowest number of executions (11) since 1988, while Virginia became the 23rd state - and first southern state - to abolish the death penalty, and the Biden administration established a temporary moratorium on federal executions in July. The minority of countries that still retain the death penalty are on notice: a world without state-sanctioned killing is not only imaginable - it is within reach and we will continue to fight for it. - Agn\u00e8s Callamard, Amnesty International\u2019s Secretary General Read the full report below.

Amnesty International recorded 883 executions in 20 countries in 2022, marking a 53% increase from 579 recorded in 2021. This figure represents the highest number of executions that Amnesty International has recorded in the past five years (since 2017, when 993 executions were recorded). China remained the world\u2019s leading executioner, but the true extent of the use of the death penalty in this country remains unknown as this data remains classified as a state secret. The global figure recorded by Amnesty International excludes the thousands of executions believed to have been carried out in China, as well as those carried out in Viet Nam and North Korea where Amnesty International believes the death penalty was resorted to extensively. Most known executions took place in China (1000s), Iran (at least 576) Saudi Arabia (196), Egypt (24), and the USA (18). In 2022, 93% of known global executions (excluding China) were carried out in the Middle East and North Africa. The 196 executions recorded in Saudi Arabia were the highest yearly total known for this country in 30 years. A total of 13 women were known to have been executed in the world: Iran (12) and Saudi Arabia (1). Amnesty International recorded executions in 20 countries, compared to 18 countries in 2021. 325 executions were recorded for drug-related offences: 255 in Iran; 57 in Saudi Arabia; 11 in Singapore; and in China (+). In calculating the global total of executions carried out for drug-related offences, two were counted for China in accordance with Amnesty International\u2019s research methodology. At least 3 public executions were recorded in Afghanistan (1+) and Iran (2). In Iran, at least 5 people were executed for crimes that occurred when they were below 18 years of age. A post shared by Amnesty International UK (@amnestyuk) Executions resumed in five countries: Afghanistan, Kuwait, Myanmar, Palestine (State of) and Singapore. Botswana, UAE and Oman carried out executions in 2021, but did not do so in 2022. The following methods of execution were used in 2022: beheading, hanging, lethal injection and shooting. At least 2,016 new death sentences across 52 countries were imposed in 2022, compared to at least 2,052 in 56 countries in 2021. Amnesty International recorded commutations or pardons of death sentences in 26 countries. Five countries \u2014 Bahrain, Comoros, Laos, Niger and South Korea \u2014 handed down death sentences after a hiatus. Amnesty International recorded at least 28 exonerations of prisoners who had been sentenced to death in four countries: Kenya (20), Morocco/Western Sahara (1), the USA (2), and Zimbabwe (5). Globally, at least 28,282 people were under sentence of death at the end of 2022. Six countries abolished the death penalty either fully (Kazakhstan, Papua New Guinea, Sierra Leone, and the Central African Republic) or partially (Equatorial Guinea and Zambia, who abolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes only) in 2022. At the end of 2022, 112 countries were abolitionist for all crimes, while 9 were abolitionist for ordinary crimes only Regional Analysis For the 14th consecutive year, the USA remained the only country in the region to carry out executions. The number of executions carried out in the USA increased by 64%, rising from 11 in 2021 to 18 in 2022. Outgoing Governor of Oregon Kate Brown commuted all remaining death sentences in the state. For the sixth consecutive year, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and the USA were the only countries in the region that imposed new death sentences. In Asia-Pacific, eight countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Japan, Myanmar, North Korea, Singapore and Viet Nam) are known to have carried out executions in 2022, an increase from five in 2021. The number of new death sentences recorded regionally increased by 5% from 819 in 2021 to 861 in 2022. Military authorities carried out the first executions in Myanmar in four decades, including the execution of two high-profile opposition politicians. Executions also resumed after a hiatus in Afghanistan and Singapore. Papua New Guinea became the 21st country in the Asia-Pacific region to abolish the death penalty for all crimes. Belarus carried out one execution in 2022. It was the only country in Europe and Central Asia to do so. Kazakhstan abolished the death penalty for all crimes and ratified a key UN treaty on abolition. Russia and Tajikistan continued to observe moratoriums on executions\n\nquestion: How many new death sentences were imposed in 2022?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "2,016", "usage": 1177}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.
