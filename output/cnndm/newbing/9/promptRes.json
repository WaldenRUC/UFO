He was 99. \u201cIt is with profound sadness that we announce that the World\u2019s Greatest MC who ever lived, Bob Barker has left us,\" Barker's publicist Roger Neal said in a statement. Born on December 12, 1923, in Darrington, Washington, Barker worked part-time in radio while in college and was given his own radio series in 1950, The Bob Barker Show, which ran for six years. He began his game show career in 1956, hosting Truth or Consequences. His stint lasted 19 years.

In 2006, he announced his pending retirement and officially exited The Price Is Right on June 15 2007 after 35 years. Barker did, however, return three times, once to promote his autobiography, Priceless Memories, and another in 2013 to celebrate his 90th birthday. Barker, additionally, made his first \u2013 and only \u2013 feature film role in the 1996 Adam Sandler movie Happy Gilmore. And he made the rounds on television, guest-starring as himself in comedies The Nanny, Something So Right, How I Met Your Mother and Yes, Dear, and lending his voice in the animated Futurama and Family Guy.
