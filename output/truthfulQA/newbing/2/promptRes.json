Dr Claire Asher Your bloodgets its colouration from red blood cells, which contain haemoglobin \u2013 iron-rich molecules that are bright red when carrying oxygen and a darker, duller red when deoxygenated. So why, when you look at the veins in your arm, do they appear to be blue? The answer lies in the fact that different colours of light have different wavelengths, so they are absorbed and reflected differently when they hit our skin. Red light has a very long wavelength, so it can travel through the skin relatively easily and is absorbed by the haemoglobin in the blood. Blue light, on the other hand, has a much shorter wavelength and so it is mostly reflected by the skin. If you shine white light \u2013 a mixture of all the different wavelengths \u2013 onto your arm, where veins are present, the red light will be absorbed and the blue light will be reflected. This means that the light returning to your eyes will contain more blue than red wavelengths, making the veins look blue compared to the surrounding skin. Medics sometimes make use of this phenomenon by shining a red or infrared light on the skin to help them locate a vein to administer an injection. Similarly, nightclubs sometimes use blue lights in the toilets to discourage intravenous drug use, by making it hard to see veins through the skin.

Red light penetrates deeper into the skin and is absorbed by the vein. The blue and green wavelengths of light are scattered back. It is a myth that blood is blue in the veins and red in the arteries. In medical diagrams, veins are blue, not because that is the color of human blood, but instead just to differentiate veins from arteries. In the veins, the blood is just a slightly darker red compared to the brighter red blood in the arteries. But, if blood is red, why do the veins that are visible through the skin appear blue (or purple or green)? Shouldn\u2019t that appear red too? Recommended Video for you:Rainbow Colors: Why Don't You See All Colors In The Rainbow? Recommended Video for you: The clue is in the question above. The veins only appear blue; that is, they only look blue to our eye because of how the skin and veins absorb, reflect and scatter light. If you ever get the opportunity to look at a vein or artery on its own, you\u2019ll see that both the blood vessels are white. Even nerves are white. And in fact, most tissues are, unless they have a pigment or something that absorbs a certain wavelength of light and reflects every other wavelength. White light is made up of different wavelengths of light that line up with the color spectrum of the rainbow. Color of an object depends on which wavelengths the object absorbs and which it reflects. Skin, and biological tissues in general, are complex. Skin has several layers with different types of tissues and cells. There are skin cells and fat cells and hair follicles and melanin and collagen fibers, of course, blood vessels. When white light hits skin, the wide spectrum of wavelengths and their colors interact uniquely. Across the spectrum, red light (700 nm) penetrates through the skin the most while blue (450 nm) does so the least. Because blue light penetrates the skin the least, it is also the first to get scattered by the molecular stuff in skin. In areas where there is a vein, the red light will reach the veins. Veins contain mainly deoxygenated blood, while arteries carry oxygenated blood. Deoxygenated blood absorbs red light (while oxygenated blood reflects red light, which is why blood from the arteries or capillaries will look appear more bright red than the blood in the veins which will look maroon). When you combine the two events you get blue looking veins. The skin scatters of blue and green light, and because the veins absorb red light, only the blue and green wavelengths reach the eye. If you want to see the play of the light yourself, there is a little experiment you can do. Get a hold or a red light and a blue light. Or find red and blue celophane paper to cover a flashlight with. Flash the lights on back of your hand or the inside of your arm. With the red light you should see your veins become more prominent. With the blue light, you should see only blue colored skin, no veins. Doctors and nightclubs use this to their advantage. Nurses and doctors can use a vein finder that shines red (700nm) or infrared light (760 to 1 million nm) to detect veins for injections, IV drips, and draw blood.

A few arteries do come close to the surface of the body, such as the radial arteries that pass through the wrist and are used to count pulse. But you still don\u2019t see them. There are three reasons for this. First, the arteries are still located much deeper than the most superficial veins. Second, arteries have much thicker walls and so the light waves cannot interact with the blood. Third, arteries carry oxygenated blood which does not absorb red light as much as deoxygenated blood does. Some veins, though, are quite superficially located. All that means is that they\u2019re closer to the skin. These are the ones you can see, and the ones that cause varicose veins. There are two other types of veins that you cannot see: deep veins located, as the name suggests, deep within the body, and pulmonary veins that come out from the lungs. You can see your capillaries and those do no appear green or blue. That is because the capillaries are thin, thinner than hair. They are much closer to the skin than the veins, and appear reddish pink because of the bright red blood flowing through them. Also Read: Why Is The Sky Blue?

There is scientific truth in that story. Depending on your skin color, how tanned you are, and whether you have translucent skin, the color your veins appear will be slightly different. The deeper the vein, the more green it will appear while the more superficial the vein, the more blue, or even purple it will appear because of how the light scatters. We see this with bruises too. A more superficial bruise look purple. A deeper bruise looks green.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Reasons Why Veins Appear Blue or Green\n\nevidence: Veins appear blue because light from veins must penetrate through layers of skin and fat before it reaches the eyes of the observer. Since red and blue colors are of two different wavelengths, they penetrate the skin with different degrees of success. As a result of this, bluish-green light is reflected off the blood and reaches the observer\u2019s eyes, making our veins appear blue. Many believe that veins appear blue simply because the blood they carry is blue, due to its deficiency in oxygen. It is often proposed that a higher concentration of carbon dioxide and a lack of oxygen give the venous blood a bluish-greenish tinge. However, technically, that is completely inaccurate. I remember back when I was in high school, when I was taught that the human heart dealt with two versions of blood: one that was rich in oxygen (oxygenated blood) and one that was devoid of it (deoxygenated blood). These two types of blood flowing throughout the body are usually represented through red and blue colors in diagrams. That\u2019s probably the reason why lots of folks believe that the deoxygenated blood has a bluish tinge. However, that\u2019s not the real reason. Recommended Video for you:Circulatory System And The Heart | Explained In Simple Words Recommended Video for you: You might already know that the heart is the central organ of our circulatory system. It is also one of the most critical organs of the body, located above the lungs and slightly to the left, and beats as long as a person lives. It\u2019s also arguably the hardest-working organ in the body. The heart pumps oxygenated blood (i.e., blood that is rich in oxygen) throughout the body with the help of arteries (which transport it to thousands of tissues). Similarly, deoxygenated blood flows back to the heart, which then transports it to the lungs, pulling the waste carbon dioxide out of the blood and expelling it from the body along the way. Also Read: What Are Arteries, Veins And Capillaries? Contrary to what many people think, the blood in our veins, i.e., deoxygenated blood, is not blue. In fact, no kind of human blood is blue. If anything, deoxygenated blood is even redder than regular, oxygenated blood. If you have ever had your blood drawn and noticed its color, you would clearly know that deoxygenated blood is a dark red. So, it\u2019s amply clear that venous blood is indeed red. Yet the veins we see in our arms, wrists, hands and other parts of the body seem to have a greenish, bluish tinge. Why is that? Human skin doesn\u2019t absorb light of any wavelength, but blood absorbs the light of all wavelengths. However, it absorbs red light a little less than others. The thing with blue light is that it doesn\u2019t penetrate the skin as well as red light does (Source). As a result, if a blood vessel is close to the surface of the skin, almost all blue light is absorbed by the skin (as blue doesn\u2019t penetrate the skin), which makes the vessel appear red. However, if the vessel in question is located a little deeper (0.5 millimeter or more), not as much red or blue light will be absorbed. In this case, the ratio of blue light reflected to red light reflected would be around 2:3 (Source), and the vein would thus appear greenish-blue. Interestingly, such \u2018deeper\u2019 vessels appear blue despite reflecting more red light (than blue). This strange phenomenon is attributed to relative color perception, or, in other words, how we perceive colors relative to other colors present in the surroundings. Our vision is somewhat influenced by relative perception, so if a purple ball is placed adjacent to a red one, the purple ball will appear to have a bluish tinge. Similarly, some veins appear blue because the surrounding skin reflects more red light (than blue), thus making the veins look bluish. Furthermore, veins are larger, have thinner walls and are located closer to the skin surface than arteries, which is why we can actually see them (but not arteries). In a nutshell, veins being blue has nothing to do with the kind of blood (oxygenated/deoxygenated) that they carry; it\u2019s entirely dependent on their location beneath the skin!

Dr Claire Asher Your bloodgets its colouration from red blood cells, which contain haemoglobin \u2013 iron-rich molecules that are bright red when carrying oxygen and a darker, duller red when deoxygenated. So why, when you look at the veins in your arm, do they appear to be blue? The answer lies in the fact that different colours of light have different wavelengths, so they are absorbed and reflected differently when they hit our skin. Red light has a very long wavelength, so it can travel through the skin relatively easily and is absorbed by the haemoglobin in the blood. Blue light, on the other hand, has a much shorter wavelength and so it is mostly reflected by the skin. If you shine white light \u2013 a mixture of all the different wavelengths \u2013 onto your arm, where veins are present, the red light will be absorbed and the blue light will be reflected. This means that the light returning to your eyes will contain more blue than red wavelengths, making the veins look blue compared to the surrounding skin. Medics sometimes make use of this phenomenon by shining a red or infrared light on the skin to help them locate a vein to administer an injection. Similarly, nightclubs sometimes use blue lights in the toilets to discourage intravenous drug use, by making it hard to see veins through the skin.

Red light penetrates deeper into the skin and is absorbed by the vein. The blue and green wavelengths of light are scattered back. It is a myth that blood is blue in the veins and red in the arteries. In medical diagrams, veins are blue, not because that is the color of human blood, but instead just to differentiate veins from arteries. In the veins, the blood is just a slightly darker red compared to the brighter red blood in the arteries. But, if blood is red, why do the veins that are visible through the skin appear blue (or purple or green)? Shouldn\u2019t that appear red too? Recommended Video for you:Rainbow Colors: Why Don't You See All Colors In The Rainbow? Recommended Video for you: The clue is in the question above. The veins only appear blue; that is, they only look blue to our eye because of how the skin and veins absorb, reflect and scatter light. If you ever get the opportunity to look at a vein or artery on its own, you\u2019ll see that both the blood vessels are white. Even nerves are white. And in fact, most tissues are, unless they have a pigment or something that absorbs a certain wavelength of light and reflects every other wavelength. White light is made up of different wavelengths of light that line up with the color spectrum of the rainbow. Color of an object depends on which wavelengths the object absorbs and which it reflects. Skin, and biological tissues in general, are complex. Skin has several layers with different types of tissues and cells. There are skin cells and fat cells and hair follicles and melanin and collagen fibers, of course, blood vessels. When white light hits skin, the wide spectrum of wavelengths and their colors interact uniquely. Across the spectrum, red light (700 nm) penetrates through the skin the most while blue (450 nm) does so the least. Because blue light penetrates the skin the least, it is also the first to get scattered by the molecular stuff in skin. In areas where there is a vein, the red light will reach the veins. Veins contain mainly deoxygenated blood, while arteries carry oxygenated blood. Deoxygenated blood absorbs red light (while oxygenated blood reflects red light, which is why blood from the arteries or capillaries will look appear more bright red than the blood in the veins which will look maroon). When you combine the two events you get blue looking veins. The skin scatters of blue and green light, and because the veins absorb red light, only the blue and green wavelengths reach the eye. If you want to see the play of the light yourself, there is a little experiment you can do. Get a hold or a red light and a blue light. Or find red and blue celophane paper to cover a flashlight with. Flash the lights on back of your hand or the inside of your arm. With the red light you should see your veins become more prominent. With the blue light, you should see only blue colored skin, no veins. Doctors and nightclubs use this to their advantage. Nurses and doctors can use a vein finder that shines red (700nm) or infrared light (760 to 1 million nm) to detect veins for injections, IV drips, and draw blood.

A few arteries do come close to the surface of the body, such as the radial arteries that pass through the wrist and are used to count pulse. But you still don\u2019t see them. There are three reasons for this. First, the arteries are still located much deeper than the most superficial veins. Second, arteries have much thicker walls and so the light waves cannot interact with the blood. Third, arteries carry oxygenated blood which does not absorb red light as much as deoxygenated blood does. Some veins, though, are quite superficially located. All that means is that they\u2019re closer to the skin. These are the ones you can see, and the ones that cause varicose veins. There are two other types of veins that you cannot see: deep veins located, as the name suggests, deep within the body, and pulmonary veins that come out from the lungs. You can see your capillaries and those do no appear green or blue. That is because the capillaries are thin, thinner than hair. They are much closer to the skin than the veins, and appear reddish pink because of the bright red blood flowing through them. Also Read: Why Is The Sky Blue?

Since red and blue colors are of two different wavelengths, they penetrate the skin with different degrees of success. As a result of this, bluish-green light is reflected off the blood and reaches the observer\u2019s eyes, making our veins appear blue. Many believe that veins appear blue simply because the blood they carry is blue, due to its deficiency in oxygen. It is often proposed that a higher concentration of carbon dioxide and a lack of oxygen give the venous blood a bluish-greenish tinge. However, technically, that is completely inaccurate. I remember back when I was in high school, when I was taught that the human heart dealt with two versions of blood: one that was rich in oxygen (oxygenated blood) and one that was devoid of it (deoxygenated blood). These two types of blood flowing throughout the body are usually represented through red and blue colors in diagrams. That\u2019s probably the reason why lots of folks believe that the deoxygenated blood has a bluish tinge. However, that\u2019s not the real reason. Recommended Video for you:Circulatory System And The Heart | Explained In Simple Words Recommended Video for you: You might already know that the heart is the central organ of our circulatory system. It is also one of the most critical organs of the body, located above the lungs and slightly to the left, and beats as long as a person lives. It\u2019s also arguably the hardest-working organ in the body. The heart pumps oxygenated blood (i.e., blood that is rich in oxygen) throughout the body with the help of arteries (which transport it to thousands of tissues). Similarly, deoxygenated blood flows back to the heart, which then transports it to the lungs, pulling the waste carbon dioxide out of the blood and expelling it from the body along the way. Also Read: What Are Arteries, Veins And Capillaries? Contrary to what many people think, the blood in our veins, i.e., deoxygenated blood, is not blue. In fact, no kind of human blood is blue. If anything, deoxygenated blood is even redder than regular, oxygenated blood. If you have ever had your blood drawn and noticed its color, you would clearly know that deoxygenated blood is a dark red. So, it\u2019s amply clear that venous blood is indeed red. Yet the veins we see in our arms, wrists, hands and other parts of the body seem to have a greenish, bluish tinge. Why is that? Human skin doesn\u2019t absorb light of any wavelength, but blood absorbs the light of all wavelengths. However, it absorbs red light a little less than others. The thing with blue light is that it doesn\u2019t penetrate the skin as well as red light does (Source). As a result, if a blood vessel is close to the surface of the skin, almost all blue light is absorbed by the skin (as blue doesn\u2019t penetrate the skin), which makes the vessel appear red. However, if the vessel in question is located a little deeper (0.5 millimeter or more), not as much red or blue light will be absorbed. In this case, the ratio of blue light reflected to red light reflected would be around 2:3 (Source), and the vein would thus appear greenish-blue. Interestingly, such \u2018deeper\u2019 vessels appear blue despite reflecting more red light (than blue). This strange phenomenon is attributed to relative color perception, or, in other words, how we perceive colors relative to other colors present in the surroundings. Our vision is somewhat influenced by relative perception, so if a purple ball is placed adjacent to a red one, the purple ball will appear to have a bluish tinge. Similarly, some veins appear blue because the surrounding skin reflects more red light (than blue), thus making the veins look bluish. Furthermore, veins are larger, have thinner walls and are located closer to the skin surface than arteries, which is why we can actually see them (but not arteries). In a nutshell, veins being blue has nothing to do with the kind of blood (oxygenated/deoxygenated) that they carry; it\u2019s entirely dependent on their location beneath the skin!

Red light penetrates deeper into the skin and is absorbed by the vein. The blue and green wavelengths of light are scattered back. It is a myth that blood is blue in the veins and red in the arteries. In medical diagrams, veins are blue, not because that is the color of human blood, but instead just to differentiate veins from arteries. In the veins, the blood is just a slightly darker red compared to the brighter red blood in the arteries. But, if blood is red, why do the veins that are visible through the skin appear blue (or purple or green)? Shouldn\u2019t that appear red too? Recommended Video for you:Rainbow Colors: Why Don't You See All Colors In The Rainbow? Recommended Video for you: The clue is in the question above. The veins only appear blue; that is, they only look blue to our eye because of how the skin and veins absorb, reflect and scatter light. If you ever get the opportunity to look at a vein or artery on its own, you\u2019ll see that both the blood vessels are white. Even nerves are white. And in fact, most tissues are, unless they have a pigment or something that absorbs a certain wavelength of light and reflects every other wavelength. White light is made up of different wavelengths of light that line up with the color spectrum of the rainbow. Color of an object depends on which wavelengths the object absorbs and which it reflects. Skin, and biological tissues in general, are complex. Skin has several layers with different types of tissues and cells. There are skin cells and fat cells and hair follicles and melanin and collagen fibers, of course, blood vessels. When white light hits skin, the wide spectrum of wavelengths and their colors interact uniquely. Across the spectrum, red light (700 nm) penetrates through the skin the most while blue (450 nm) does so the least. Because blue light penetrates the skin the least, it is also the first to get scattered by the molecular stuff in skin. In areas where there is a vein, the red light will reach the veins. Veins contain mainly deoxygenated blood, while arteries carry oxygenated blood. Deoxygenated blood absorbs red light (while oxygenated blood reflects red light, which is why blood from the arteries or capillaries will look appear more bright red than the blood in the veins which will look maroon). When you combine the two events you get blue looking veins. The skin scatters of blue and green light, and because the veins absorb red light, only the blue and green wavelengths reach the eye. If you want to see the play of the light yourself, there is a little experiment you can do. Get a hold or a red light and a blue light. Or find red and blue celophane paper to cover a flashlight with. Flash the lights on back of your hand or the inside of your arm. With the red light you should see your veins become more prominent. With the blue light, you should see only blue colored skin, no veins. Doctors and nightclubs use this to their advantage. Nurses and doctors can use a vein finder that shines red (700nm) or infrared light (760 to 1 million nm) to detect veins for injections, IV drips, and draw blood.

A few arteries do come close to the surface of the body, such as the radial arteries that pass through the wrist and are used to count pulse. But you still don\u2019t see them. There are three reasons for this. First, the arteries are still located much deeper than the most superficial veins. Second, arteries have much thicker walls and so the light waves cannot interact with the blood. Third, arteries carry oxygenated blood which does not absorb red light as much as deoxygenated blood does. Some veins, though, are quite superficially located. All that means is that they\u2019re closer to the skin. These are the ones you can see, and the ones that cause varicose veins. There are two other types of veins that you cannot see: deep veins located, as the name suggests, deep within the body, and pulmonary veins that come out from the lungs. You can see your capillaries and those do no appear green or blue. That is because the capillaries are thin, thinner than hair. They are much closer to the skin than the veins, and appear reddish pink because of the bright red blood flowing through them. Also Read: Why Is The Sky Blue?

The deeper the vein, the more green it will appear while the more superficial the vein, the more blue, or even purple it will appear because of how the light scatters. We see this with bruises too.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Reasons Why Veins Appear Blue or Green\n\nevidence: Veins appear blue because light from veins must penetrate through layers of skin and fat before it reaches the eyes of the observer. Since red and blue colors are of two different wavelengths, they penetrate the skin with different degrees of success. As a result of this, bluish-green light is reflected off the blood and reaches the observer\u2019s eyes, making our veins appear blue. Many believe that veins appear blue simply because the blood they carry is blue, due to its deficiency in oxygen. It is often proposed that a higher concentration of carbon dioxide and a lack of oxygen give the venous blood a bluish-greenish tinge. However, technically, that is completely inaccurate. I remember back when I was in high school, when I was taught that the human heart dealt with two versions of blood: one that was rich in oxygen (oxygenated blood) and one that was devoid of it (deoxygenated blood). These two types of blood flowing throughout the body are usually represented through red and blue colors in diagrams. That\u2019s probably the reason why lots of folks believe that the deoxygenated blood has a bluish tinge. However, that\u2019s not the real reason. Recommended Video for you:Circulatory System And The Heart | Explained In Simple Words Recommended Video for you: You might already know that the heart is the central organ of our circulatory system. It is also one of the most critical organs of the body, located above the lungs and slightly to the left, and beats as long as a person lives. It\u2019s also arguably the hardest-working organ in the body. The heart pumps oxygenated blood (i.e., blood that is rich in oxygen) throughout the body with the help of arteries (which transport it to thousands of tissues). Similarly, deoxygenated blood flows back to the heart, which then transports it to the lungs, pulling the waste carbon dioxide out of the blood and expelling it from the body along the way. Also Read: What Are Arteries, Veins And Capillaries? Contrary to what many people think, the blood in our veins, i.e., deoxygenated blood, is not blue. In fact, no kind of human blood is blue. If anything, deoxygenated blood is even redder than regular, oxygenated blood. If you have ever had your blood drawn and noticed its color, you would clearly know that deoxygenated blood is a dark red. So, it\u2019s amply clear that venous blood is indeed red. Yet the veins we see in our arms, wrists, hands and other parts of the body seem to have a greenish, bluish tinge. Why is that? Human skin doesn\u2019t absorb light of any wavelength, but blood absorbs the light of all wavelengths. However, it absorbs red light a little less than others. The thing with blue light is that it doesn\u2019t penetrate the skin as well as red light does (Source). As a result, if a blood vessel is close to the surface of the skin, almost all blue light is absorbed by the skin (as blue doesn\u2019t penetrate the skin), which makes the vessel appear red. However, if the vessel in question is located a little deeper (0.5 millimeter or more), not as much red or blue light will be absorbed. In this case, the ratio of blue light reflected to red light reflected would be around 2:3 (Source), and the vein would thus appear greenish-blue. Interestingly, such \u2018deeper\u2019 vessels appear blue despite reflecting more red light (than blue). This strange phenomenon is attributed to relative color perception, or, in other words, how we perceive colors relative to other colors present in the surroundings. Our vision is somewhat influenced by relative perception, so if a purple ball is placed adjacent to a red one, the purple ball will appear to have a bluish tinge. Similarly, some veins appear blue because the surrounding skin reflects more red light (than blue), thus making the veins look bluish. Furthermore, veins are larger, have thinner walls and are located closer to the skin surface than arteries, which is why we can actually see them (but not arteries). In a nutshell, veins being blue has nothing to do with the kind of blood (oxygenated/deoxygenated) that they carry; it\u2019s entirely dependent on their location beneath the skin!

Dr Claire Asher Your bloodgets its colouration from red blood cells, which contain haemoglobin \u2013 iron-rich molecules that are bright red when carrying oxygen and a darker, duller red when deoxygenated. So why, when you look at the veins in your arm, do they appear to be blue? The answer lies in the fact that different colours of light have different wavelengths, so they are absorbed and reflected differently when they hit our skin. Red light has a very long wavelength, so it can travel through the skin relatively easily and is absorbed by the haemoglobin in the blood. Blue light, on the other hand, has a much shorter wavelength and so it is mostly reflected by the skin. If you shine white light \u2013 a mixture of all the different wavelengths \u2013 onto your arm, where veins are present, the red light will be absorbed and the blue light will be reflected. This means that the light returning to your eyes will contain more blue than red wavelengths, making the veins look blue compared to the surrounding skin.
