Many people think you must be a family member to file a missing person report, but that is incorrect. You should file a missing person report immediately. Waiting a day or two to see if they return on their own is not advised. The most important hours of a missing person case are the first 72 hours. This is when search and rescue crews have the greatest chance of recovering the person alive. Filing a missing person report triggers a few critical events. The person is entered into NCIC (National Crime Information Center). NCIC is a database shared amongst law enforcement agencies. Once entered into NCIC, if an officer in any city or state comes into contact with the missing person and runs them through the system, they will be flagged as missing. If the missing person is deemed an \u201cat risk\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d missing (I will cover these designations in a different blog post), then a BOLO (Be On The Lookout) will be sent from the reporting agency to all nearby agencies with a thorough description of the missing person and the circumstances of their missing case. If a crime is believed to have been committed in connection to their disappearance, such as a kidnapping, then an APB (All Points Bulletin) will be issued. As I mentioned at the beginning, anyone can file a missing person report about a missing person, not just family. Law enforcement might try to tell you differently or use various excuses to prevent you from filing a report, but you have the right to file a report if you wish, and they have the duty to take that report. To prove that point, this is a screenshot from the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department policies and procedures regarding missing person reports: Los Angeles County Sheriff Department Missing Person Report Policy and Procedure Often, a person goes missing because they are under duress. Whether abduction, mental health, Alzheimer\u2019s, autism, runaway, getting lost, or any other reason, search and rescue (SAR) has the greatest chance of finding the missing person and recovering them safely if they are reported missing sooner than later. You should file the missing person report with the law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over the area the person was last seen in person. If the last seen location is unknown, then file the missing person report with the law enforcement agency of the area where the missing person lives. It\u2019s better to file a missing person report and error on the side of caution than blindly hope for the best. Get the resources in motion.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: Immediate Reporting of Missing Persons: The Importance of Acting Quickly\n\nevidence: Do you need to report someone as a missing person, either in Australia or overseas? If you have concerns for someone\u2019s safety and welfare, and their whereabouts is unknown, you can file a missing person\u2019s report at your local police station. The first 24 hours following a person\u2019s disappearance are the most crucial. This is because the sooner police are able to follow-up leads, such as the availability of CCTV footage, the more likely the person will be found safe and well. It is important to give the police all the facts and circumstances related to the disappearance, including search efforts already made by you and others. Relevant information may include intimate or private details regarding the missing person or their lifestyle. When filing a missing person\u2019s report, be prepared (where possible) with the following information about the person who is missing: If you have concerns for the safety and welfare of a family member or friend missing overseas, and you have been unable to make contact with them (or any known travelling companions), you can report them missing at your local police station. You will need all the information included in \u2018What information do I need to take?\u2019 to file a missing person\u2019s report. Once a missing person\u2019s report has been made the report will be forwarded by your local police to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), who will coordinate the investigation into the missing person. DFAT has a Consular Section responsible for the protection and welfare of Australians travelling or living abroad. DFAT will pursue individual matters based on a serious concern for the welfare of an Australian overseas and a belief the person concerned needs consular assistance. Consular staff will contact you and explain the missing person processes and will also confirm family consent for DFAT to provide information to external agencies, including INTERPOL, and foreign law enforcement agencies (where applicable). Your local police will also undertake checks with financial institutions (banks), mobile phone providers, and airlines and travel operators. For further information of DFATs roll with Australians missing overseas, you can view their guide on the Smart Traveller website. If you are overseas and want to report someone as missing in Australia, you need to attend your local police station and make a missing persons report. Your local police will complete a missing person report and disseminate the report through INTERPOL channels to the relevant Australian police jurisdiction for further investigation. The Australian local police station who takes carriage of the case will liaise with the Next of Kin (NOK) of the missing person, either by email or telephone in relation to ongoing investigation. Alternatively, if you know of any friends or family of your loved one who are in Australia, they may attend their local police station on your behalf to lodge a missing persons report as described above. When making the report to local police, be prepared with the information listed in 'What information do I need to take?' section above. Richard Leape was last heard from by his family in April 1993.

If you have concerns for someone\u2019s safety and welfare, and their whereabouts is unknown, you can file a missing person\u2019s report at your local police station. The first 24 hours following a person\u2019s disappearance are the most crucial. This is because the sooner police are able to follow-up leads, such as the availability of CCTV footage, the more likely the person will be found safe and well. It is important to give the police all the facts and circumstances related to the disappearance, including search efforts already made by you and others. Relevant information may include intimate or private details regarding the missing person or their lifestyle. When filing a missing person\u2019s report, be prepared (where possible) with the following information about the person who is missing: If you have concerns for the safety and welfare of a family member or friend missing overseas, and you have been unable to make contact with them (or any known travelling companions), you can report them missing at your local police station. You will need all the information included in \u2018What information do I need to take?\u2019 to file a missing person\u2019s report.

DFAT has a Consular Section responsible for the protection and welfare of Australians travelling or living abroad. DFAT will pursue individual matters based on a serious concern for the welfare of an Australian overseas and a belief the person concerned needs consular assistance.

Many people think you must be a family member to file a missing person report, but that is incorrect. You should file a missing person report immediately. Waiting a day or two to see if they return on their own is not advised. The most important hours of a missing person case are the first 72 hours. This is when search and rescue crews have the greatest chance of recovering the person alive. Filing a missing person report triggers a few critical events. The person is entered into NCIC (National Crime Information Center). NCIC is a database shared amongst law enforcement agencies. Once entered into NCIC, if an officer in any city or state comes into contact with the missing person and runs them through the system, they will be flagged as missing. If the missing person is deemed an \u201cat risk\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d missing (I will cover these designations in a different blog post), then a BOLO (Be On The Lookout) will be sent from the reporting agency to all nearby agencies with a thorough description of the missing person and the circumstances of their missing case. If a crime is believed to have been committed in connection to their disappearance, such as a kidnapping, then an APB (All Points Bulletin) will be issued. As I mentioned at the beginning, anyone can file a missing person report about a missing person, not just family. Law enforcement might try to tell you differently or use various excuses to prevent you from filing a report, but you have the right to file a report if you wish, and they have the duty to take that report. To prove that point, this is a screenshot from the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department policies and procedures regarding missing person reports: Los Angeles County Sheriff Department Missing Person Report Policy and Procedure Often, a person goes missing because they are under duress. Whether abduction, mental health, Alzheimer\u2019s, autism, runaway, getting lost, or any other reason, search and rescue (SAR) has the greatest chance of finding the missing person and recovering them safely if they are reported missing sooner than later. You should file the missing person report with the law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over the area the person was last seen in person. If the last seen location is unknown, then file the missing person report with the law enforcement agency of the area where the missing person lives. It\u2019s better to file a missing person report and error on the side of caution than blindly hope for the best. Get the resources in motion.

If you have concerns for someone\u2019s safety and welfare, and their whereabouts is unknown, you can file a missing person\u2019s report at your local police station. The first 24 hours following a person\u2019s disappearance are the most crucial. This is because the sooner police are able to follow-up leads, such as the availability of CCTV footage, the more likely the person will be found safe and well. It is important to give the police all the facts and circumstances related to the disappearance, including search efforts already made by you and others. Relevant information may include intimate or private details regarding the missing person or their lifestyle. When filing a missing person\u2019s report, be prepared (where possible) with the following information about the person who is missing: If you have concerns for the safety and welfare of a family member or friend missing overseas, and you have been unable to make contact with them (or any known travelling companions), you can report them missing at your local police station. You will need all the information included in \u2018What information do I need to take?\u2019 to file a missing person\u2019s report. Once a missing person\u2019s report has been made the report will be forwarded by your local police to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), who will coordinate the investigation into the missing person. DFAT has a Consular Section responsible for the protection and welfare of Australians travelling or living abroad. DFAT will pursue individual matters based on a serious concern for the welfare of an Australian overseas and a belief the person concerned needs consular assistance. Consular staff will contact you and explain the missing person processes and will also confirm family consent for DFAT to provide information to external agencies, including INTERPOL, and foreign law enforcement agencies (where applicable). Your local police will also undertake checks with financial institutions (banks), mobile phone providers, and airlines and travel operators. For further information of DFATs roll with Australians missing overseas, you can view their guide on the Smart Traveller website. If you are overseas and want to report someone as missing in Australia, you need to attend your local police station and make a missing persons report. Your local police will complete a missing person report and disseminate the report through INTERPOL channels to the relevant Australian police jurisdiction for further investigation. The Australian local police station who takes carriage of the case will liaise with the Next of Kin (NOK) of the missing person, either by email or telephone in relation to ongoing investigation. Alternatively, if you know of any friends or family of your loved one who are in Australia, they may attend their local police station on your behalf to lodge a missing persons report as described above. When making the report to local police, be prepared with the information listed in 'What information do I need to take?' section above. Richard Leape was last heard from by his family in April 1993.
