Here\u2019s how it works. Bullfighting conjures a common image: An angry bull charging at a matador\u2019s small red cape, the muleta. But, why does the beast charge at the sight of red? Actually, it doesn\u2019t. Bulls, along with all other cattle, are color-blind to red. Thus, the bull is likely irritated not by the muleta\u2019s color, but by the cape\u2019s movement as the matador whips it around. In support of this is the fact that a bull charges the matador\u2019s other cape \u2014 the larger capote \u2014 with equal fury. Yet this cape is magenta on one side and gold or blue on the other. Related: What Really Happens to Fighting Bulls After the Fight? Still don\u2019t believe it? In 2007, the Discovery Channel\u2019s MythBusters tested a live bull on color versus movement in three separate experiments. First, they put three stationary flags, which were red, blue and white, in the bull\u2019s enclosure. The bull charged all three flags regardless of color. Next, they put three dummies dressed in red, blue and white in the ring, and again the bull charged all three without discrimination (and actually charged the red dummy last). Finally, they put a live person dressed in red in the ring with the bull. That person stood still while two cowboys \u2014 not in red \u2014 moved around the ring. The bull went after the moving cowboys and left the motionless red-clad person alone. So, if a bull can\u2019t see red, why is the muleta red? The small cape comes out in the last stage of the bullfight, when the bull meets its end, and its color helps mask one of the more gruesome aspects of a bull fight: splatters of the animal's blood.

What do matadors wear under their pants? The traje de luces (\u2018suit of lights\u2019) is the traditional clothing that Spanish bullfighters (toreros, picadores, and rejoneadores) wear in the bullring.

The electric pink socks, that supposedly indicate wealth as well as serve to rile the bulls up for a good fight.

Contrary to popular belief, bulls are not angered by the colour red. You\u2019ve almost certainly heard the myth that bulls will go crazy at the sight of anything red. For quite a while, popular culture has included stories of unfortunate characters, unlucky enough to be wearing red clothes or carrying a red balloon, suddenly finding themselves the sole target of a bull\u2019s aggression. But not only is this trope overdone, it\u2019s completely incorrect. These clich\u00e9s stem from matadors\u2019 use of muletas (red capes) to taunt bulls into an ill-advised charge. However, the cape\u2019s colour is not for the bull, it\u2019s for the spectators. A red cape masks the blood of the bull during the finale of a bullfight when the matador finally puts down the bull and ends the fight. With a red cape, the spectacle looks a lot less violent and bloody than it really is, in the hopes that it will be more enjoyable for those watching. The cause of the bull\u2019s anger is not the redness of the cape. That would actually be the cape\u2019s motion. A cape of any colour could cause the bull to charge as long as the bullfighter waves it the same way. In fact, bulls are colour-blind. They only have 2 cones (colour receptors) in their eyes, whereas humans have 3. Bulls, like other ungulates (animals with hooves), have dichromatic vision. They have two different cone cells, those cells in the retina that detect color. One type of cone cell detect short wavelengths (S-cone) that is most sensitive at 444 to 445 nm (blue/violet region). The other type of cone cells perceive medium to long wavelengths at around 552-555 nm (yellowish-green). Since red light has a wavelength of around 650 nm, the bulls would only be able to see the capes in shades of grey. Rate This Biscuit Average rating / 5. Vote count: No ratings so far!

This style of bullfighting involves a physical contest with humans (and other animals) attempting to publicly subdue, immobilize, or kill a bull. The most common bull used is the Spanish Fighting Bull (Toro Bravo), a type of cattle native to the Iberian Peninsula. This style of bullfighting is seen to be both a sport and performance art. The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition \u2013 bulls are color blind. They attack moving objects; the brightly-colored cape is used to mask blood stains. In a traditional corrida, three toreros (or matadores) each \"fight\" against two out of a total of six \"fighting\" bulls to death, each bull being at least four years old and weighs up to about 600 kg (1,300 lb) (with a minimum weight limit of 460 kg (1,010 lb)). Bullfighting season in Spain runs from March to October. The practice is also known as a corrida de toros (\"bull-running\") or tauromaquia. Since the late-1980s, bullfighting in Spain has declined in popularity due to animal welfare concerns, its association with blood sport, and its links to nationalism. Most historians trace festivities involving bulls to prehistoric times, as a trend that once extended through the entire Mediterranean coast and has just survived in Iberia and part of France. Early bullfights had a high mortality rate. Alejandro Recio, a Spanish historian, considers the Neolithic city of Konya, Turkey, discovered by James Mellaart in 1958, as evidence of sacrificial tauromaquia associated with traditional rituals. This claim is based on the abundance of representations of bulls, as well as on the preservation of horns and bullheads attached to walls. Since then various archeological findings have proven the uninterrupted importance of the bull as a symbol of the sun for the Iberian cults, like the presence of berracos (known in Portuguese as berr\u00e3o), or the importance of the bull in the surviving Celtiberian and Celtic rituals that continued into the 21st century. These pre-Roman religions centered on the ritual sacrifice of sacred animals through direct or symbolic combat and was a likely motive for the depiction of bulls. Bullrings are believed to originate their bullfighting tradition from Roman gladiator games. During Roman Hispania gladiators were forced to fight animals by sword, such as bulls, bears, and wolves. The Romans tried to abolish and ban the \"puere\" practice of bullfighting, considering it was too risky for the youth and not a proper way to worship the state deities. According to Frommer's Travel Guide, bullfighting in Spain traces its origins to 711 CE, with the first official bullfight, or \"corrida de toros,\" being held in honor of the coronation of King Alfonso VIII. Once part of the Roman Empire, Spain owes its bullfighting tradition in part to gladiator games. At first, bullfighting was done on horseback and was reserved for Spanish aristocracy. During the Arab rule of Iberia, the ruling class tried to ban the practice of bullfighting, considering it a pagan celebration and heresy. Bullfighting was illegal in all Arab territory but became a mark of identity and resistance for Christian Iberians, especially for the nobility that started using it as a way to gain prestige. At first, bullfighting was done on horseback and was reserved for Spanish aristocracy; in contests the \"fighters\" were referred to as rejoneadores. In the 16th century Pope Pius V banned bullfighting for its ties to paganism and for the danger it posed to the participants. Anyone who would sponsor, watch or participate in a bullfight was to be excommunicated by the Church. Spanish and Portuguese bullfighters kept the tradition alive covertly, and his successor, Pope Gregory XIII, took efforts to relax this penalty. Pope Gregory advised bullfighters to not use the sport as way to honor Jesus Christ or the Saints, as was typical in Spain and Portugal. King Philip V, the first King of Spain of Bourbon descent, ended bullfighting in the country because he believed it was in poor taste for nobles to practice such a bloody sport. The change in bullfighting standards ran parallel to the discontent of the foreign rule of the Bourbons, and their lack of interest in understanding the politics, economics or culture of their new kingdom culminated in the Esquilache Riots of 1766. New forms of bullfighting continued to develop as decrees against the activity proved largely ineffective. After growing in popularity in Spain, King Carlos III attempted to ban bullfighting in 1771. He attempted to reduce the social tension by building two of the eldest and largest bullfighting rings in Madrid as part of an offensive to fix the resentment some nobles and other powerful\n\nquestion: Are bulls color blind?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "YES", "usage": 1130}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

King Charles IV attempted to formally ban the sport again after his predecessor made concessions. King Joseph Bonaparte reversed this decision by hosting a bullfight during his coronation in 1808. Joaqu\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Costillares (1743\u20131800) was a Spanish bullfighter from Seville who has been credited with founding modern Spanish-style bullfighting. He established the \"cuadrillas tradition\" where teams of two or three banderilleros and two picadors taunt the bull. He also organized the tercios de lidia (\"thirds of fight\") borrowed from the theatre; invented the Veronica and other basic cape movements as well as the current traje de luces (\"suit of light\"); and created the cape maneuvers (muleta), typical in this style of bullfighting since the 19th century. Each matador has six assistants\u2014two picadores (\"lancers\") mounted on horseback, three banderilleros (\"flagmen\"), and a mozo de espada (\"the lad of the swords\"). Collectively they compose a cuadrilla or team of bullfighters. The crew also includes an ayuda (aide to sword servant) and subalternos (subordinates) including at least two peones (pages, singular pe\u00f3n). The modern Spanish-style bullfight (corrida, \"run\") is highly standardized, with three distinct parts (tercios, \"thirds\"), the start of each of which is announced by a trumpet sound. The participants first enter the arena in a parade (pase\u00edllo) to salute the presiding dignitary (presidente), usually accompanied by band music. The corrida begins to the tune of live-played pasodobles, many of which were composed to honour famous toreros. Torero costumes are influenced by 17th century Andalusian clothing. Matadors are distinguished by a \"suit of lights\" (traje de luces), custom-made and embroidered with silver or golden thread. The bull then enters the ring to be tested for aggressiveness by the matador and banderilleros with the magenta and gold capote (dress cape). Bulls are raised on the open range by specialist breeding estates called ganader\u00eda. The bull enters the arena with a rosette on its back bearing the colours of the estate of its origin. The first stage is called the tercio de varas (\"third of lances\"). The matador observes how the bull reacts to the waving of the banderilleros' cloak. They also note vision problems, unusual head movements, or if the bull favors a part of the ring called a querencia (territory). A bull trying to reach its querencia is often more dangerous than a bull that is attacking the cape directly. The initial attack by the matador is called the suerte de capote (\"act of the cape\"), and there are a number of fundamental \"lances\" (or passes) that matadors make; the most common being the ver\u00f3nica (named after Saint Veronica), which is the act of a matador letting their cloak trail over the bull's head as it runs past. Then two picadores enter the arena each armed with a lance (vara), mounted on large heavily-padded and blindfolded horses. The entrance of the horse attracts the bull to the picadores. The picadores repeatedly drive their lances into the muscles (morrillo) of the bull's neck to weaken the animal. As the picadores stab the bull's neck, the bull charges and attempts to lift the picador's horse. If the picador is successful, the bull will hold its head and horns lower as a result of injury and weakness during the following stages of the fight. This makes the bull less dangerous to enable the matador to perform the passes of modern bullfighting. In a mandatory step in the corrida, regulations require that a plaza judge ensures a certain number of hits are made before it is considered completed. In the next stage \u2013 the tercio de banderillas (\"third of small flag\") \u2013 the matador attempts to plant two barbed or dart-like sticks known as banderillas (\"little flags\") onto the bull's shoulders. These weaken the ridges of neck and shoulder muscle (which set fighting bulls apart from cattle) through loss of blood, while also spurring the bull into making more aggressive charges. By this point the bull has lost a significant amount of blood, exhausting the animal. The matador then enters with his cape and sword, attempting to tire the bull further with several runs at the cape. The matadors place the banderillas around the bull. If the presidente decides that the bull is relatively weak or unwilling to fight, they may order the use of black banderillas, considered to be a poor reflection on the breeder. In the third\n\nquestion: Are bulls color blind?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1083}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This cape is stretched with a wooden dowel and, in right-handed passes, the sword as well. Having dedicated the bull to an individual or the whole audience, the matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a series of passes, demonstrating their control over it. The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition \u2013 bulls are color blind. The movement of the cape is what irritates bulls; the colour by itself has the purpose of masking blood stains. The faena is the entire performance combined with the muleta, which is usually broken down into a series of tandas (episodes). A typical tanda consists of three to five basic passes and then the finishing touch (remate), such as a pase de pecho, or pase de desprecio. Well-received passes are celebrated by the audience with shouts of \"\u00a1ole!\". The faena ends with a final series of passes in which the matador with a muleta attempts to manoeuvre the bull into a position to stab it between the shoulder blades and through the aorta or heart. The entire part of the bullfight with the muleta is called the tercio de muerte (\"third of death\") or suerte de muleta (\"act of muleta\"). The act of thrusting the sword (estoca or estoque) is called an estocada. A clumsy estocada that fails to give a \"quick and clean death\" will often raise loud protests from the crowd and may ruin the whole performance. If estocada is not successful, the matador must then perform a descabello and cut the bull's spinal cord with a second sword called verdugo, to kill it instantly and spare the animal pain. Although the matador's final blow is usually fatal, it may take the bull some time to die. A coup de gr\u00e2ce is therefore administered by a pe\u00f3n named a puntillero, using a dagger to further pierce the spinal cord. The matador must kill the bull in 15 minutes after the first muleta pass, at most. After 10 minutes, if the bull is still alive, the presidente will order an aviso, a warning given with a trumpet sound. If a further three minutes elapse, a second aviso will be given; a third and final aviso is given after a further two minutes. The presidente will then give an order to have the bull returned to its pen (corral), or, if local law so requires, to have the bull killed outside the ring. It is a dishonor for the failing matador. The bull's body is dragged out by a team of mules. If the presidente is impressed by the performance of the bull, he orders a tour around the ring to honour the animal. Very rarely, a bull will be allowed to survive a fight as an indulgence granted in recognition of an exceptional performance. The spectators will demand an indulto from the presidente, by waving handkerchiefs before the estocada. The matador will stop and look at the presidente. If he stands still, he will resume their action and kill the bull. But if he has an orange handkerchief hung on his balcony, the matador will imitate the estocada with a banderilla or with the palm of his hand and the bull will be \"freed\". Such bulls are generally retired from competition and raised as studs, as their experience in the ring makes them extremely dangerous opponents. A fighting bull is never used in the ring twice, because they learn from experience, and the entire strategy of the matador is based on the assumption that the bull has not learned from previous experience. This also invalidates bulls who have been run in their estate by illegal fighters (maletillas), who in earlier times would sneak into an estate by night to practice their skills. A trofeo (trophy) is the usual indicator of a successful faena. When the records of bullfights are kept, trofeos earned by the matador are always mentioned. If the crowd demands, the matador is allowed to take a lap of victory around the ring. If at least half of the spectators petition the presidente by waving handkerchiefs, the presidente is obliged to award the matador with one ear of the bull. To award the matador with another ear or with two ears and the tail (los m\u00e1ximos trofeos), depends solely on the presidente's appreciation. A matador who won at least two ears is given the permission to be carried on the shoulders of the admirers (salida en hombros). In some cities, such as Seville,\n\nquestion: Are bulls color blind?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Yes", "usage": 1082}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In general, a matador that faces a bull that is freed is usually awarded los m\u00e1ximos trofeos, although only symbolically; ears or the tail can only be physically cut off of a dead bull. Bullfighting is normally fatal for the bull, and it is dangerous for the matador. Picadors and banderilleros are sometimes gored, but this is not common. The suertes with the capote are risky, but it is the faena, in particular the estocada, that is the most dangerous. A matador of classical (Manolete) style is trained to divert the bull with the muleta but to come close to the right horn as he makes the fatal sword-thrust between the scapulae and through the aorta. At this moment, the danger to the matador is the greatest. Most matadors have been gored many times. A special type of surgeon has developed, in Spain and elsewhere, to treat cornadas, or horn-wounds. The bullring normally has an infirmary with an operating room, reserved for the immediate treatment of matadors with cornadas. The bullring has a chapel where a matador can pray before the corrida and where a priest can be found in case an emergency sacrament of extreme unction (also known as Anointing of the Sick or Last Rites) is needed. A poll conducted in 2014\u20132015 by the Spanish Ministry of Culture places bullfighting 10th in the list of most popular paid leisure activities. In 2015 9.5% of Spaniards went to a paid bullfight. By Autonomous Communities, Navarre headed the list, followed by Castile-Leon, Aragon, La Rioja, Castile-La Mancha and Extremadura. The regions least interested in bullfighting were Galicia, the Canary Islands, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. According to the poll, during the 2014\u201315 period 9.5% of the potential audience (Spaniards aged 15 and higher) would have attended a corrida at least once; this amounts to over 3.5 million people. The history of female bullfighters participating in Spanish-style bullfighting has been traced to the sport's earliest renditions, namely during the late-1700s and early 1800s. Francisco Goya, an 18th-century Spanish painter, first depicted a female bullfighter in his work La Pajuelera, which featured a woman sparring with a bull on horseback. The Spanish government banned women from participating in the sport from 1909 to 1934, following the Second Spanish Republic's liberation of women until 1939. On 10 August 1974, under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, women were once again allowed to bullfight. Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Hern\u00e1ndez G\u00f3mez was the first woman to earn her bullfighting license (torera) after the ban was lifted. During the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, women were forced to exile in other Spanish-speaking countries and the United States in order to continue bullfighting. Throughout the 1980s women had difficulty completing their alternativa, a ceremony where a bullfighter becomes a matador, due to the social pressures of the decade. Activism against bullfighting has existed in Spain since the beginning of the early 20th century, when a group of intellectuals, belonging to the Generation of '98, rallied against the popularity of bullfighting and other social issues, dismissing them as \"non-European\" elements of Spanish culture, which were to blame for the country's social and economic backwardness. In the 21st century, bullfighting has come under increasing attack from animal rights activists and political actors for its links to Spanish nationalism. Separatist and nationalist sentiment in Catalonia has played a key role in the region-wide ban of a practice which is strongly associated to Spanish national identity. However the bous al carrer runnings of the bulls are not banned. Galician and Basque nationalists have also expressed abolitionist stances, although in the case of the latter this has been somewhat mooted by the conundrum of bullfighting being at the heart of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona. Animal welfare concerns are perhaps the prime driver of opposition to bullfighting outside Spain, although rejection of traditionalism and Criollo elitism may also play a role in Latin America. In the Canary Islands, bullfights are banned but cock fights, banned in the rest of Spain, are popular. Animal rights activists claim bullfighting is a cruel or barbarous blood sport, in which the bull suffers severe stress and a slow, torturous death.

Other arguments in favor of bullfighting include those to the effect that the death of animals in slaughterhouses is often much worse than the death in the ring, and that both types of animal die for entertainment since humans do not need to consume meat, eating it instead for taste (bulls enter the food chain after the bullfight). The last common defense to the practice is the conservationist standpoint for both the tradition itself and the Bravo bull variety, as Bravo bulls are the closest living relative to the European wild bull, completely extinct now and divided into sub-breeds whose only use is provision of meat and milk, serving the food industry. After years of increased pressure against bullfighting by abolitionist movements within Spain, the death of bullfighter Victor Barrio in July 2016 led to hundreds of comments being posted on various social media expressing joy towards the event and openly mocking his family and widow. This led to a significant backlash within Spain against anti-bullfighting activism, and criminal investigations are ongoing against those involved. Within a few days of Barrio's death, over 200,000 signatures had been collected demanding action be taken against one such activist. Tercio de varas: Suerte de capote.

Here\u2019s how it works. Bullfighting conjures a common image: An angry bull charging at a matador\u2019s small red cape, the muleta. But, why does the beast charge at the sight of red? Actually, it doesn\u2019t. Bulls, along with all other cattle, are color-blind to red. Thus, the bull is likely irritated not by the muleta\u2019s color, but by the cape\u2019s movement as the matador whips it around. In support of this is the fact that a bull charges the matador\u2019s other cape \u2014 the larger capote \u2014 with equal fury. Yet this cape is magenta on one side and gold or blue on the other. Related: What Really Happens to Fighting Bulls After the Fight? Still don\u2019t believe it? In 2007, the Discovery Channel\u2019s MythBusters tested a live bull on color versus movement in three separate experiments. First, they put three stationary flags, which were red, blue and white, in the bull\u2019s enclosure. The bull charged all three flags regardless of color. Next, they put three dummies dressed in red, blue and white in the ring, and again the bull charged all three without discrimination (and actually charged the red dummy last). Finally, they put a live person dressed in red in the ring with the bull. That person stood still while two cowboys \u2014 not in red \u2014 moved around the ring. The bull went after the moving cowboys and left the motionless red-clad person alone. So, if a bull can\u2019t see red, why is the muleta red?

In fact, the muleta is only used in the final 3rd of a bullfight The matador uses it to hide his sword, and he pierces the bull as it charges past. The cape is traditionally red to mask the bloodstains. Matadors became national heroes because of their courage and their ability to be in front of a bull.

What do matadors wear under their pants? The traje de luces (\u2018suit of lights\u2019) is the traditional clothing that Spanish bullfighters (toreros, picadores, and rejoneadores) wear in the bullring. The term originates from the sequins and reflective threads of gold or silver. Why do matadors wear pink socks? The electric pink socks, that supposedly indicate wealth as well as serve to rile the bulls up for a good fight.

However, the cape\u2019s colour is not for the bull, it\u2019s for the spectators. A red cape masks the blood of the bull during the finale of a bullfight when the matador finally puts down the bull and ends the fight. With a red cape, the spectacle looks a lot less violent and bloody than it really is, in the hopes that it will be more enjoyable for those watching. The cause of the bull\u2019s anger is not the redness of the cape. That would actually be the cape\u2019s motion. A cape of any colour could cause the bull to charge as long as the bullfighter waves it the same way. In fact, bulls are colour-blind. They only have 2 cones (colour receptors) in their eyes, whereas humans have 3. Bulls, like other ungulates (animals with hooves), have dichromatic vision. They have two different cone cells, those cells in the retina that detect color. One type of cone cell detect short wavelengths (S-cone) that is most sensitive at 444 to 445 nm (blue/violet region). The other type of cone cells perceive medium to long wavelengths at around 552-555 nm (yellowish-green). Since red light has a wavelength of around 650 nm, the bulls would only be able to see the capes in shades of grey. Rate This Biscuit Average rating / 5. Vote count: No ratings so far!

This style of bullfighting involves a physical contest with humans (and other animals) attempting to publicly subdue, immobilize, or kill a bull. The most common bull used is the Spanish Fighting Bull (Toro Bravo), a type of cattle native to the Iberian Peninsula. This style of bullfighting is seen to be both a sport and performance art. The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition \u2013 bulls are color blind. They attack moving objects; the brightly-colored cape is used to mask blood stains. In a traditional corrida, three toreros (or matadores) each \"fight\" against two out of a total of six \"fighting\" bulls to death, each bull being at least four years old and weighs up to about 600 kg (1,300 lb) (with a minimum weight limit of 460 kg (1,010 lb)). Bullfighting season in Spain runs from March to October. The practice is also known as a corrida de toros (\"bull-running\") or tauromaquia. Since the late-1980s, bullfighting in Spain has declined in popularity due to animal welfare concerns, its association with blood sport, and its links to nationalism. Most historians trace festivities involving bulls to prehistoric times, as a trend that once extended through the entire Mediterranean coast and has just survived in Iberia and part of France. Early bullfights had a high mortality rate. Alejandro Recio, a Spanish historian, considers the Neolithic city of Konya, Turkey, discovered by James Mellaart in 1958, as evidence of sacrificial tauromaquia associated with traditional rituals. This claim is based on the abundance of representations of bulls, as well as on the preservation of horns and bullheads attached to walls. Since then various archeological findings have proven the uninterrupted importance of the bull as a symbol of the sun for the Iberian cults, like the presence of berracos (known in Portuguese as berr\u00e3o), or the importance of the bull in the surviving Celtiberian and Celtic rituals that continued into the 21st century. These pre-Roman religions centered on the ritual sacrifice of sacred animals through direct or symbolic combat and was a likely motive for the depiction of bulls. Bullrings are believed to originate their bullfighting tradition from Roman gladiator games. During Roman Hispania gladiators were forced to fight animals by sword, such as bulls, bears, and wolves. The Romans tried to abolish and ban the \"puere\" practice of bullfighting, considering it was too risky for the youth and not a proper way to worship the state deities. According to Frommer's Travel Guide, bullfighting in Spain traces its origins to 711 CE, with the first official bullfight, or \"corrida de toros,\" being held in honor of the coronation of King Alfonso VIII. Once part of the Roman Empire, Spain owes its bullfighting tradition in part to gladiator games. At first, bullfighting was done on horseback and was reserved for Spanish aristocracy. During the Arab rule of Iberia, the ruling class tried to ban the practice of bullfighting, considering it a pagan celebration and heresy. Bullfighting was illegal in all Arab territory but became a mark of identity and resistance for Christian Iberians, especially for the nobility that started using it as a way to gain prestige. At first, bullfighting was done on horseback and was reserved for Spanish aristocracy; in contests the \"fighters\" were referred to as rejoneadores. In the 16th century Pope Pius V banned bullfighting for its ties to paganism and for the danger it posed to the participants. Anyone who would sponsor, watch or participate in a bullfight was to be excommunicated by the Church. Spanish and Portuguese bullfighters kept the tradition alive covertly, and his successor, Pope Gregory XIII, took efforts to relax this penalty. Pope Gregory advised bullfighters to not use the sport as way to honor Jesus Christ or the Saints, as was typical in Spain and Portugal. King Philip V, the first King of Spain of Bourbon descent, ended bullfighting in the country because he believed it was in poor taste for nobles to practice such a bloody sport. The change in bullfighting standards ran parallel to the discontent of the foreign rule of the Bourbons, and their lack of interest in understanding the politics, economics or culture of their new kingdom culminated in the Esquilache Riots of 1766. New forms of bullfighting continued to develop as decrees against the activity proved largely ineffective. After growing in popularity in Spain, King Carlos III attempted to ban bullfighting in 1771. He attempted to reduce the social tension by building two of the eldest and largest bullfighting rings in Madrid as part of an offensive to fix the resentment some nobles and other powerful\n\nquestion: Why do matadors wave red capes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition \u2013 bulls are color blind.

King Charles IV attempted to formally ban the sport again after his predecessor made concessions. King Joseph Bonaparte reversed this decision by hosting a bullfight during his coronation in 1808. Joaqu\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Costillares (1743\u20131800) was a Spanish bullfighter from Seville who has been credited with founding modern Spanish-style bullfighting. He established the \"cuadrillas tradition\" where teams of two or three banderilleros and two picadors taunt the bull. He also organized the tercios de lidia (\"thirds of fight\") borrowed from the theatre; invented the Veronica and other basic cape movements as well as the current traje de luces (\"suit of light\"); and created the cape maneuvers (muleta), typical in this style of bullfighting since the 19th century. Each matador has six assistants\u2014two picadores (\"lancers\") mounted on horseback, three banderilleros (\"flagmen\"), and a mozo de espada (\"the lad of the swords\"). Collectively they compose a cuadrilla or team of bullfighters. The crew also includes an ayuda (aide to sword servant) and subalternos (subordinates) including at least two peones (pages, singular pe\u00f3n). The modern Spanish-style bullfight (corrida, \"run\") is highly standardized, with three distinct parts (tercios, \"thirds\"), the start of each of which is announced by a trumpet sound. The participants first enter the arena in a parade (pase\u00edllo) to salute the presiding dignitary (presidente), usually accompanied by band music. The corrida begins to the tune of live-played pasodobles, many of which were composed to honour famous toreros. Torero costumes are influenced by 17th century Andalusian clothing. Matadors are distinguished by a \"suit of lights\" (traje de luces), custom-made and embroidered with silver or golden thread. The bull then enters the ring to be tested for aggressiveness by the matador and banderilleros with the magenta and gold capote (dress cape). Bulls are raised on the open range by specialist breeding estates called ganader\u00eda. The bull enters the arena with a rosette on its back bearing the colours of the estate of its origin. The first stage is called the tercio de varas (\"third of lances\"). The matador observes how the bull reacts to the waving of the banderilleros' cloak. They also note vision problems, unusual head movements, or if the bull favors a part of the ring called a querencia (territory). A bull trying to reach its querencia is often more dangerous than a bull that is attacking the cape directly. The initial attack by the matador is called the suerte de capote (\"act of the cape\"), and there are a number of fundamental \"lances\" (or passes) that matadors make; the most common being the ver\u00f3nica (named after Saint Veronica), which is the act of a matador letting their cloak trail over the bull's head as it runs past. Then two picadores enter the arena each armed with a lance (vara), mounted on large heavily-padded and blindfolded horses. The entrance of the horse attracts the bull to the picadores. The picadores repeatedly drive their lances into the muscles (morrillo) of the bull's neck to weaken the animal. As the picadores stab the bull's neck, the bull charges and attempts to lift the picador's horse. If the picador is successful, the bull will hold its head and horns lower as a result of injury and weakness during the following stages of the fight. This makes the bull less dangerous to enable the matador to perform the passes of modern bullfighting. In a mandatory step in the corrida, regulations require that a plaza judge ensures a certain number of hits are made before it is considered completed. In the next stage \u2013 the tercio de banderillas (\"third of small flag\") \u2013 the matador attempts to plant two barbed or dart-like sticks known as banderillas (\"little flags\") onto the bull's shoulders. These weaken the ridges of neck and shoulder muscle (which set fighting bulls apart from cattle) through loss of blood, while also spurring the bull into making more aggressive charges. By this point the bull has lost a significant amount of blood, exhausting the animal. The matador then enters with his cape and sword, attempting to tire the bull further with several runs at the cape. The matadors place the banderillas around the bull. If the presidente decides that the bull is relatively weak or unwilling to fight, they may order the use of black banderillas, considered to be a poor reflection on the breeder. In the third\n\nquestion: Why do matadors wave red capes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The matadors wave red capes to observe how the bull reacts during the initial stage of the bullfight.", "usage": 1107}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This cape is stretched with a wooden dowel and, in right-handed passes, the sword as well. Having dedicated the bull to an individual or the whole audience, the matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a series of passes, demonstrating their control over it. The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition \u2013 bulls are color blind. The movement of the cape is what irritates bulls; the colour by itself has the purpose of masking blood stains. The faena is the entire performance combined with the muleta, which is usually broken down into a series of tandas (episodes). A typical tanda consists of three to five basic passes and then the finishing touch (remate), such as a pase de pecho, or pase de desprecio. Well-received passes are celebrated by the audience with shouts of \"\u00a1ole!\". The faena ends with a final series of passes in which the matador with a muleta attempts to manoeuvre the bull into a position to stab it between the shoulder blades and through the aorta or heart. The entire part of the bullfight with the muleta is called the tercio de muerte (\"third of death\") or suerte de muleta (\"act of muleta\"). The act of thrusting the sword (estoca or estoque) is called an estocada. A clumsy estocada that fails to give a \"quick and clean death\" will often raise loud protests from the crowd and may ruin the whole performance. If estocada is not successful, the matador must then perform a descabello and cut the bull's spinal cord with a second sword called verdugo, to kill it instantly and spare the animal pain. Although the matador's final blow is usually fatal, it may take the bull some time to die. A coup de gr\u00e2ce is therefore administered by a pe\u00f3n named a puntillero, using a dagger to further pierce the spinal cord. The matador must kill the bull in 15 minutes after the first muleta pass, at most. After 10 minutes, if the bull is still alive, the presidente will order an aviso, a warning given with a trumpet sound. If a further three minutes elapse, a second aviso will be given; a third and final aviso is given after a further two minutes. The presidente will then give an order to have the bull returned to its pen (corral), or, if local law so requires, to have the bull killed outside the ring. It is a dishonor for the failing matador. The bull's body is dragged out by a team of mules. If the presidente is impressed by the performance of the bull, he orders a tour around the ring to honour the animal. Very rarely, a bull will be allowed to survive a fight as an indulgence granted in recognition of an exceptional performance. The spectators will demand an indulto from the presidente, by waving handkerchiefs before the estocada. The matador will stop and look at the presidente. If he stands still, he will resume their action and kill the bull. But if he has an orange handkerchief hung on his balcony, the matador will imitate the estocada with a banderilla or with the palm of his hand and the bull will be \"freed\". Such bulls are generally retired from competition and raised as studs, as their experience in the ring makes them extremely dangerous opponents. A fighting bull is never used in the ring twice, because they learn from experience, and the entire strategy of the matador is based on the assumption that the bull has not learned from previous experience. This also invalidates bulls who have been run in their estate by illegal fighters (maletillas), who in earlier times would sneak into an estate by night to practice their skills. A trofeo (trophy) is the usual indicator of a successful faena. When the records of bullfights are kept, trofeos earned by the matador are always mentioned. If the crowd demands, the matador is allowed to take a lap of victory around the ring. If at least half of the spectators petition the presidente by waving handkerchiefs, the presidente is obliged to award the matador with one ear of the bull. To award the matador with another ear or with two ears and the tail (los m\u00e1ximos trofeos), depends solely on the presidente's appreciation. A matador who won at least two ears is given the permission to be carried on the shoulders of the admirers (salida en hombros). In some cities, such as Seville,\n\nquestion: Why do matadors wave red capes?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The movement of the cape is what irritates bulls; the color by itself has the purpose of masking blood stains.

In general, a matador that faces a bull that is freed is usually awarded los m\u00e1ximos trofeos, although only symbolically; ears or the tail can only be physically cut off of a dead bull. Bullfighting is normally fatal for the bull, and it is dangerous for the matador. Picadors and banderilleros are sometimes gored, but this is not common. The suertes with the capote are risky, but it is the faena, in particular the estocada, that is the most dangerous. A matador of classical (Manolete) style is trained to divert the bull with the muleta but to come close to the right horn as he makes the fatal sword-thrust between the scapulae and through the aorta. At this moment, the danger to the matador is the greatest. Most matadors have been gored many times. A special type of surgeon has developed, in Spain and elsewhere, to treat cornadas, or horn-wounds. The bullring normally has an infirmary with an operating room, reserved for the immediate treatment of matadors with cornadas. The bullring has a chapel where a matador can pray before the corrida and where a priest can be found in case an emergency sacrament of extreme unction (also known as Anointing of the Sick or Last Rites) is needed. A poll conducted in 2014\u20132015 by the Spanish Ministry of Culture places bullfighting 10th in the list of most popular paid leisure activities. In 2015 9.5% of Spaniards went to a paid bullfight. By Autonomous Communities, Navarre headed the list, followed by Castile-Leon, Aragon, La Rioja, Castile-La Mancha and Extremadura. The regions least interested in bullfighting were Galicia, the Canary Islands, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. According to the poll, during the 2014\u201315 period 9.5% of the potential audience (Spaniards aged 15 and higher) would have attended a corrida at least once; this amounts to over 3.5 million people. The history of female bullfighters participating in Spanish-style bullfighting has been traced to the sport's earliest renditions, namely during the late-1700s and early 1800s. Francisco Goya, an 18th-century Spanish painter, first depicted a female bullfighter in his work La Pajuelera, which featured a woman sparring with a bull on horseback. The Spanish government banned women from participating in the sport from 1909 to 1934, following the Second Spanish Republic's liberation of women until 1939. On 10 August 1974, under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, women were once again allowed to bullfight. Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Hern\u00e1ndez G\u00f3mez was the first woman to earn her bullfighting license (torera) after the ban was lifted. During the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, women were forced to exile in other Spanish-speaking countries and the United States in order to continue bullfighting. Throughout the 1980s women had difficulty completing their alternativa, a ceremony where a bullfighter becomes a matador, due to the social pressures of the decade. Activism against bullfighting has existed in Spain since the beginning of the early 20th century, when a group of intellectuals, belonging to the Generation of '98, rallied against the popularity of bullfighting and other social issues, dismissing them as \"non-European\" elements of Spanish culture, which were to blame for the country's social and economic backwardness. In the 21st century, bullfighting has come under increasing attack from animal rights activists and political actors for its links to Spanish nationalism. Separatist and nationalist sentiment in Catalonia has played a key role in the region-wide ban of a practice which is strongly associated to Spanish national identity. However the bous al carrer runnings of the bulls are not banned. Galician and Basque nationalists have also expressed abolitionist stances, although in the case of the latter this has been somewhat mooted by the conundrum of bullfighting being at the heart of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona. Animal welfare concerns are perhaps the prime driver of opposition to bullfighting outside Spain, although rejection of traditionalism and Criollo elitism may also play a role in Latin America. In the Canary Islands, bullfights are banned but cock fights, banned in the rest of Spain, are popular. Animal rights activists claim bullfighting is a cruel or barbarous blood sport, in which the bull suffers severe stress and a slow, torturous death.

Other arguments in favor of bullfighting include those to the effect that the death of animals in slaughterhouses is often much worse than the death in the ring, and that both types of animal die for entertainment since humans do not need to consume meat, eating it instead for taste (bulls enter the food chain after the bullfight). The last common defense to the practice is the conservationist standpoint for both the tradition itself and the Bravo bull variety, as Bravo bulls are the closest living relative to the European wild bull, completely extinct now and divided into sub-breeds whose only use is provision of meat and milk, serving the food industry. After years of increased pressure against bullfighting by abolitionist movements within Spain, the death of bullfighter Victor Barrio in July 2016 led to hundreds of comments being posted on various social media expressing joy towards the event and openly mocking his family and widow. This led to a significant backlash within Spain against anti-bullfighting activism, and criminal investigations are ongoing against those involved. Within a few days of Barrio's death, over 200,000 signatures had been collected demanding action be taken against one such activist. Tercio de varas: Suerte de capote.

Here\u2019s how it works. Bullfighting conjures a common image: An angry bull charging at a matador\u2019s small red cape, the muleta. But, why does the beast charge at the sight of red? Actually, it doesn\u2019t. Bulls, along with all other cattle, are color-blind to red. Thus, the bull is likely irritated not by the muleta\u2019s color, but by the cape\u2019s movement as the matador whips it around. In support of this is the fact that a bull charges the matador\u2019s other cape \u2014 the larger capote \u2014 with equal fury. Yet this cape is magenta on one side and gold or blue on the other. Related: What Really Happens to Fighting Bulls After the Fight? Still don\u2019t believe it? In 2007, the Discovery Channel\u2019s MythBusters tested a live bull on color versus movement in three separate experiments. First, they put three stationary flags, which were red, blue and white, in the bull\u2019s enclosure. The bull charged all three flags regardless of color. Next, they put three dummies dressed in red, blue and white in the ring, and again the bull charged all three without discrimination (and actually charged the red dummy last). Finally, they put a live person dressed in red in the ring with the bull. That person stood still while two cowboys \u2014 not in red \u2014 moved around the ring. The bull went after the moving cowboys and left the motionless red-clad person alone. So, if a bull can\u2019t see red, why is the muleta red?

This is a sacred, very serious ritual. The bullfighter always gets dressed in front of a mirror, and that\u2019s where he begins to grow confident and to encourage himself, gathering the courage that he will need in the bullring. Through dressing, he can get as prepared as he can be. Bulls are irritated by the movement of the cape. They see the waving fabric and charge, regardless of color. In fact, the muleta is only used in the final 3rd of a bullfight The matador uses it to hide his sword, and he pierces the bull as it charges past. The cape is traditionally red to mask the bloodstains. Matadors became national heroes because of their courage and their ability to be in front of a bull. Most matadors came from a working-class background, and they came to symbolize the popular hero, especially at a time when working class people didn\u2019t have a place in society. What do matadors wear under their pants? The traje de luces (\u2018suit of lights\u2019) is the traditional clothing that Spanish bullfighters (toreros, picadores, and rejoneadores) wear in the bullring. The term originates from the sequins and reflective threads of gold or silver. Why do matadors wear pink socks? The electric pink socks, that supposedly indicate wealth as well as serve to rile the bulls up for a good fight.

Contrary to popular belief, bulls are not angered by the colour red. You\u2019ve almost certainly heard the myth that bulls will go crazy at the sight of anything red. For quite a while, popular culture has included stories of unfortunate characters, unlucky enough to be wearing red clothes or carrying a red balloon, suddenly finding themselves the sole target of a bull\u2019s aggression. But not only is this trope overdone, it\u2019s completely incorrect. These clich\u00e9s stem from matadors\u2019 use of muletas (red capes) to taunt bulls into an ill-advised charge. However, the cape\u2019s colour is not for the bull, it\u2019s for the spectators. A red cape masks the blood of the bull during the finale of a bullfight when the matador finally puts down the bull and ends the fight. With a red cape, the spectacle looks a lot less violent and bloody than it really is, in the hopes that it will be more enjoyable for those watching. The cause of the bull\u2019s anger is not the redness of the cape. That would actually be the cape\u2019s motion. A cape of any colour could cause the bull to charge as long as the bullfighter waves it the same way. In fact, bulls are colour-blind. They only have 2 cones (colour receptors) in their eyes, whereas humans have 3. Bulls, like other ungulates (animals with hooves), have dichromatic vision. They have two different cone cells, those cells in the retina that detect color. One type of cone cell detect short wavelengths (S-cone) that is most sensitive at 444 to 445 nm (blue/violet region). The other type of cone cells perceive medium to long wavelengths at around 552-555 nm (yellowish-green). Since red light has a wavelength of around 650 nm, the bulls would only be able to see the capes in shades of grey. Rate This Biscuit Average rating / 5. Vote count: No ratings so far!

This style of bullfighting involves a physical contest with humans (and other animals) attempting to publicly subdue, immobilize, or kill a bull. The most common bull used is the Spanish Fighting Bull (Toro Bravo), a type of cattle native to the Iberian Peninsula. This style of bullfighting is seen to be both a sport and performance art. The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition \u2013 bulls are color blind. They attack moving objects; the brightly-colored cape is used to mask blood stains. In a traditional corrida, three toreros (or matadores) each \"fight\" against two out of a total of six \"fighting\" bulls to death, each bull being at least four years old and weighs up to about 600 kg (1,300 lb) (with a minimum weight limit of 460 kg (1,010 lb)). Bullfighting season in Spain runs from March to October. The practice is also known as a corrida de toros (\"bull-running\") or tauromaquia. Since the late-1980s, bullfighting in Spain has declined in popularity due to animal welfare concerns, its association with blood sport, and its links to nationalism. Most historians trace festivities involving bulls to prehistoric times, as a trend that once extended through the entire Mediterranean coast and has just survived in Iberia and part of France. Early bullfights had a high mortality rate. Alejandro Recio, a Spanish historian, considers the Neolithic city of Konya, Turkey, discovered by James Mellaart in 1958, as evidence of sacrificial tauromaquia associated with traditional rituals. This claim is based on the abundance of representations of bulls, as well as on the preservation of horns and bullheads attached to walls. Since then various archeological findings have proven the uninterrupted importance of the bull as a symbol of the sun for the Iberian cults, like the presence of berracos (known in Portuguese as berr\u00e3o), or the importance of the bull in the surviving Celtiberian and Celtic rituals that continued into the 21st century. These pre-Roman religions centered on the ritual sacrifice of sacred animals through direct or symbolic combat and was a likely motive for the depiction of bulls. Bullrings are believed to originate their bullfighting tradition from Roman gladiator games. During Roman Hispania gladiators were forced to fight animals by sword, such as bulls, bears, and wolves. The Romans tried to abolish and ban the \"puere\" practice of bullfighting, considering it was too risky for the youth and not a proper way to worship the state deities. According to Frommer's Travel Guide, bullfighting in Spain traces its origins to 711 CE, with the first official bullfight, or \"corrida de toros,\" being held in honor of the coronation of King Alfonso VIII. Once part of the Roman Empire, Spain owes its bullfighting tradition in part to gladiator games. At first, bullfighting was done on horseback and was reserved for Spanish aristocracy. During the Arab rule of Iberia, the ruling class tried to ban the practice of bullfighting, considering it a pagan celebration and heresy. Bullfighting was illegal in all Arab territory but became a mark of identity and resistance for Christian Iberians, especially for the nobility that started using it as a way to gain prestige. At first, bullfighting was done on horseback and was reserved for Spanish aristocracy; in contests the \"fighters\" were referred to as rejoneadores. In the 16th century Pope Pius V banned bullfighting for its ties to paganism and for the danger it posed to the participants. Anyone who would sponsor, watch or participate in a bullfight was to be excommunicated by the Church. Spanish and Portuguese bullfighters kept the tradition alive covertly, and his successor, Pope Gregory XIII, took efforts to relax this penalty. Pope Gregory advised bullfighters to not use the sport as way to honor Jesus Christ or the Saints, as was typical in Spain and Portugal. King Philip V, the first King of Spain of Bourbon descent, ended bullfighting in the country because he believed it was in poor taste for nobles to practice such a bloody sport. The change in bullfighting standards ran parallel to the discontent of the foreign rule of the Bourbons, and their lack of interest in understanding the politics, economics or culture of their new kingdom culminated in the Esquilache Riots of 1766. New forms of bullfighting continued to develop as decrees against the activity proved largely ineffective. After growing in popularity in Spain, King Carlos III attempted to ban bullfighting in 1771. He attempted to reduce the social tension by building two of the eldest and largest bullfighting rings in Madrid as part of an offensive to fix the resentment some nobles and other powerful\n\nquestion: What irritates the bulls in bullfighting?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1136}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

King Charles IV attempted to formally ban the sport again after his predecessor made concessions. King Joseph Bonaparte reversed this decision by hosting a bullfight during his coronation in 1808. Joaqu\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Costillares (1743\u20131800) was a Spanish bullfighter from Seville who has been credited with founding modern Spanish-style bullfighting. He established the \"cuadrillas tradition\" where teams of two or three banderilleros and two picadors taunt the bull. He also organized the tercios de lidia (\"thirds of fight\") borrowed from the theatre; invented the Veronica and other basic cape movements as well as the current traje de luces (\"suit of light\"); and created the cape maneuvers (muleta), typical in this style of bullfighting since the 19th century. Each matador has six assistants\u2014two picadores (\"lancers\") mounted on horseback, three banderilleros (\"flagmen\"), and a mozo de espada (\"the lad of the swords\"). Collectively they compose a cuadrilla or team of bullfighters. The crew also includes an ayuda (aide to sword servant) and subalternos (subordinates) including at least two peones (pages, singular pe\u00f3n). The modern Spanish-style bullfight (corrida, \"run\") is highly standardized, with three distinct parts (tercios, \"thirds\"), the start of each of which is announced by a trumpet sound. The participants first enter the arena in a parade (pase\u00edllo) to salute the presiding dignitary (presidente), usually accompanied by band music. The corrida begins to the tune of live-played pasodobles, many of which were composed to honour famous toreros. Torero costumes are influenced by 17th century Andalusian clothing. Matadors are distinguished by a \"suit of lights\" (traje de luces), custom-made and embroidered with silver or golden thread. The bull then enters the ring to be tested for aggressiveness by the matador and banderilleros with the magenta and gold capote (dress cape). Bulls are raised on the open range by specialist breeding estates called ganader\u00eda. The bull enters the arena with a rosette on its back bearing the colours of the estate of its origin. The first stage is called the tercio de varas (\"third of lances\"). The matador observes how the bull reacts to the waving of the banderilleros' cloak. They also note vision problems, unusual head movements, or if the bull favors a part of the ring called a querencia (territory). A bull trying to reach its querencia is often more dangerous than a bull that is attacking the cape directly. The initial attack by the matador is called the suerte de capote (\"act of the cape\"), and there are a number of fundamental \"lances\" (or passes) that matadors make; the most common being the ver\u00f3nica (named after Saint Veronica), which is the act of a matador letting their cloak trail over the bull's head as it runs past. Then two picadores enter the arena each armed with a lance (vara), mounted on large heavily-padded and blindfolded horses. The entrance of the horse attracts the bull to the picadores. The picadores repeatedly drive their lances into the muscles (morrillo) of the bull's neck to weaken the animal. As the picadores stab the bull's neck, the bull charges and attempts to lift the picador's horse. If the picador is successful, the bull will hold its head and horns lower as a result of injury and weakness during the following stages of the fight. This makes the bull less dangerous to enable the matador to perform the passes of modern bullfighting. In a mandatory step in the corrida, regulations require that a plaza judge ensures a certain number of hits are made before it is considered completed. In the next stage \u2013 the tercio de banderillas (\"third of small flag\") \u2013 the matador attempts to plant two barbed or dart-like sticks known as banderillas (\"little flags\") onto the bull's shoulders. These weaken the ridges of neck and shoulder muscle (which set fighting bulls apart from cattle) through loss of blood, while also spurring the bull into making more aggressive charges. By this point the bull has lost a significant amount of blood, exhausting the animal. The matador then enters with his cape and sword, attempting to tire the bull further with several runs at the cape. The matadors place the banderillas around the bull. If the presidente decides that the bull is relatively weak or unwilling to fight, they may order the use of black banderillas, considered to be a poor reflection on the breeder. In the third\n\nquestion: What irritates the bulls in bullfighting?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The waving of the banderilleros' cloak.", "usage": 1097}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This cape is stretched with a wooden dowel and, in right-handed passes, the sword as well. Having dedicated the bull to an individual or the whole audience, the matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a series of passes, demonstrating their control over it. The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition \u2013 bulls are color blind. The movement of the cape is what irritates bulls; the colour by itself has the purpose of masking blood stains. The faena is the entire performance combined with the muleta, which is usually broken down into a series of tandas (episodes). A typical tanda consists of three to five basic passes and then the finishing touch (remate), such as a pase de pecho, or pase de desprecio. Well-received passes are celebrated by the audience with shouts of \"\u00a1ole!\". The faena ends with a final series of passes in which the matador with a muleta attempts to manoeuvre the bull into a position to stab it between the shoulder blades and through the aorta or heart. The entire part of the bullfight with the muleta is called the tercio de muerte (\"third of death\") or suerte de muleta (\"act of muleta\"). The act of thrusting the sword (estoca or estoque) is called an estocada. A clumsy estocada that fails to give a \"quick and clean death\" will often raise loud protests from the crowd and may ruin the whole performance. If estocada is not successful, the matador must then perform a descabello and cut the bull's spinal cord with a second sword called verdugo, to kill it instantly and spare the animal pain. Although the matador's final blow is usually fatal, it may take the bull some time to die. A coup de gr\u00e2ce is therefore administered by a pe\u00f3n named a puntillero, using a dagger to further pierce the spinal cord. The matador must kill the bull in 15 minutes after the first muleta pass, at most. After 10 minutes, if the bull is still alive, the presidente will order an aviso, a warning given with a trumpet sound. If a further three minutes elapse, a second aviso will be given; a third and final aviso is given after a further two minutes. The presidente will then give an order to have the bull returned to its pen (corral), or, if local law so requires, to have the bull killed outside the ring. It is a dishonor for the failing matador. The bull's body is dragged out by a team of mules. If the presidente is impressed by the performance of the bull, he orders a tour around the ring to honour the animal. Very rarely, a bull will be allowed to survive a fight as an indulgence granted in recognition of an exceptional performance. The spectators will demand an indulto from the presidente, by waving handkerchiefs before the estocada. The matador will stop and look at the presidente. If he stands still, he will resume their action and kill the bull. But if he has an orange handkerchief hung on his balcony, the matador will imitate the estocada with a banderilla or with the palm of his hand and the bull will be \"freed\". Such bulls are generally retired from competition and raised as studs, as their experience in the ring makes them extremely dangerous opponents. A fighting bull is never used in the ring twice, because they learn from experience, and the entire strategy of the matador is based on the assumption that the bull has not learned from previous experience. This also invalidates bulls who have been run in their estate by illegal fighters (maletillas), who in earlier times would sneak into an estate by night to practice their skills. A trofeo (trophy) is the usual indicator of a successful faena. When the records of bullfights are kept, trofeos earned by the matador are always mentioned. If the crowd demands, the matador is allowed to take a lap of victory around the ring. If at least half of the spectators petition the presidente by waving handkerchiefs, the presidente is obliged to award the matador with one ear of the bull. To award the matador with another ear or with two ears and the tail (los m\u00e1ximos trofeos), depends solely on the presidente's appreciation. A matador who won at least two ears is given the permission to be carried on the shoulders of the admirers (salida en hombros). In some cities, such as Seville,\n\nquestion: What irritates the bulls in bullfighting?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The movement of the red cape.", "usage": 1093}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In general, a matador that faces a bull that is freed is usually awarded los m\u00e1ximos trofeos, although only symbolically; ears or the tail can only be physically cut off of a dead bull. Bullfighting is normally fatal for the bull, and it is dangerous for the matador. Picadors and banderilleros are sometimes gored, but this is not common. The suertes with the capote are risky, but it is the faena, in particular the estocada, that is the most dangerous. A matador of classical (Manolete) style is trained to divert the bull with the muleta but to come close to the right horn as he makes the fatal sword-thrust between the scapulae and through the aorta. At this moment, the danger to the matador is the greatest. Most matadors have been gored many times. A special type of surgeon has developed, in Spain and elsewhere, to treat cornadas, or horn-wounds. The bullring normally has an infirmary with an operating room, reserved for the immediate treatment of matadors with cornadas. The bullring has a chapel where a matador can pray before the corrida and where a priest can be found in case an emergency sacrament of extreme unction (also known as Anointing of the Sick or Last Rites) is needed. A poll conducted in 2014\u20132015 by the Spanish Ministry of Culture places bullfighting 10th in the list of most popular paid leisure activities. In 2015 9.5% of Spaniards went to a paid bullfight. By Autonomous Communities, Navarre headed the list, followed by Castile-Leon, Aragon, La Rioja, Castile-La Mancha and Extremadura. The regions least interested in bullfighting were Galicia, the Canary Islands, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. According to the poll, during the 2014\u201315 period 9.5% of the potential audience (Spaniards aged 15 and higher) would have attended a corrida at least once; this amounts to over 3.5 million people. The history of female bullfighters participating in Spanish-style bullfighting has been traced to the sport's earliest renditions, namely during the late-1700s and early 1800s. Francisco Goya, an 18th-century Spanish painter, first depicted a female bullfighter in his work La Pajuelera, which featured a woman sparring with a bull on horseback. The Spanish government banned women from participating in the sport from 1909 to 1934, following the Second Spanish Republic's liberation of women until 1939. On 10 August 1974, under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, women were once again allowed to bullfight. Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Hern\u00e1ndez G\u00f3mez was the first woman to earn her bullfighting license (torera) after the ban was lifted. During the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, women were forced to exile in other Spanish-speaking countries and the United States in order to continue bullfighting. Throughout the 1980s women had difficulty completing their alternativa, a ceremony where a bullfighter becomes a matador, due to the social pressures of the decade. Activism against bullfighting has existed in Spain since the beginning of the early 20th century, when a group of intellectuals, belonging to the Generation of '98, rallied against the popularity of bullfighting and other social issues, dismissing them as \"non-European\" elements of Spanish culture, which were to blame for the country's social and economic backwardness. In the 21st century, bullfighting has come under increasing attack from animal rights activists and political actors for its links to Spanish nationalism. Separatist and nationalist sentiment in Catalonia has played a key role in the region-wide ban of a practice which is strongly associated to Spanish national identity. However the bous al carrer runnings of the bulls are not banned. Galician and Basque nationalists have also expressed abolitionist stances, although in the case of the latter this has been somewhat mooted by the conundrum of bullfighting being at the heart of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona. Animal welfare concerns are perhaps the prime driver of opposition to bullfighting outside Spain, although rejection of traditionalism and Criollo elitism may also play a role in Latin America. In the Canary Islands, bullfights are banned but cock fights, banned in the rest of Spain, are popular. Animal rights activists claim bullfighting is a cruel or barbarous blood sport, in which the bull suffers severe stress and a slow, torturous death.

Other arguments in favor of bullfighting include those to the effect that the death of animals in slaughterhouses is often much worse than the death in the ring, and that both types of animal die for entertainment since humans do not need to consume meat, eating it instead for taste (bulls enter the food chain after the bullfight). The last common defense to the practice is the conservationist standpoint for both the tradition itself and the Bravo bull variety, as Bravo bulls are the closest living relative to the European wild bull, completely extinct now and divided into sub-breeds whose only use is provision of meat and milk, serving the food industry. After years of increased pressure against bullfighting by abolitionist movements within Spain, the death of bullfighter Victor Barrio in July 2016 led to hundreds of comments being posted on various social media expressing joy towards the event and openly mocking his family and widow. This led to a significant backlash within Spain against anti-bullfighting activism, and criminal investigations are ongoing against those involved. Within a few days of Barrio's death, over 200,000 signatures had been collected demanding action be taken against one such activist. Tercio de varas: Suerte de capote.

Here\u2019s how it works. Bullfighting conjures a common image: An angry bull charging at a matador\u2019s small red cape, the muleta. But, why does the beast charge at the sight of red? Actually, it doesn\u2019t. Bulls, along with all other cattle, are color-blind to red. Thus, the bull is likely irritated not by the muleta\u2019s color, but by the cape\u2019s movement as the matador whips it around. In support of this is the fact that a bull charges the matador\u2019s other cape \u2014 the larger capote \u2014 with equal fury. Yet this cape is magenta on one side and gold or blue on the other. Related: What Really Happens to Fighting Bulls After the Fight? Still don\u2019t believe it? In 2007, the Discovery Channel\u2019s MythBusters tested a live bull on color versus movement in three separate experiments. First, they put three stationary flags, which were red, blue and white, in the bull\u2019s enclosure. The bull charged all three flags regardless of color. Next, they put three dummies dressed in red, blue and white in the ring, and again the bull charged all three without discrimination (and actually charged the red dummy last). Finally, they put a live person dressed in red in the ring with the bull. That person stood still while two cowboys \u2014 not in red \u2014 moved around the ring. The bull went after the moving cowboys and left the motionless red-clad person alone. So, if a bull can\u2019t see red, why is the muleta red?

Through dressing, he can get as prepared as he can be. Bulls are irritated by the movement of the cape. They see the waving fabric and charge, regardless of color. In fact, the muleta is only used in the final 3rd of a bullfight The matador uses it to hide his sword, and he pierces the bull as it charges past. The cape is traditionally red to mask the bloodstains. Matadors became national heroes because of their courage and their ability to be in front of a bull. Most matadors came from a working-class background, and they came to symbolize the popular hero, especially at a time when working class people didn\u2019t have a place in society. What do matadors wear under their pants? The traje de luces (\u2018suit of lights\u2019) is the traditional clothing that Spanish bullfighters (toreros, picadores, and rejoneadores) wear in the bullring. The term originates from the sequins and reflective threads of gold or silver. Why do matadors wear pink socks? The electric pink socks, that supposedly indicate wealth as well as serve to rile the bulls up for a good fight. Bullfights can be quite bloody affairs, and matadors use red so that the blood of the bull is less visible on the cape. Contrary to popular belief, bulls are not angered by the colour red.

Why do bullfighters wear red capes? Bullfighters use the red capes called muletas just because they look nice and because the color red is better visible from the stands than any other color.

However, the cape\u2019s colour is not for the bull, it\u2019s for the spectators. A red cape masks the blood of the bull during the finale of a bullfight when the matador finally puts down the bull and ends the fight. With a red cape, the spectacle looks a lot less violent and bloody than it really is, in the hopes that it will be more enjoyable for those watching. The cause of the bull\u2019s anger is not the redness of the cape. That would actually be the cape\u2019s motion. A cape of any colour could cause the bull to charge as long as the bullfighter waves it the same way. In fact, bulls are colour-blind. They only have 2 cones (colour receptors) in their eyes, whereas humans have 3. Bulls, like other ungulates (animals with hooves), have dichromatic vision. They have two different cone cells, those cells in the retina that detect color. One type of cone cell detect short wavelengths (S-cone) that is most sensitive at 444 to 445 nm (blue/violet region). The other type of cone cells perceive medium to long wavelengths at around 552-555 nm (yellowish-green). Since red light has a wavelength of around 650 nm, the bulls would only be able to see the capes in shades of grey. Rate This Biscuit Average rating / 5. Vote count: No ratings so far!

This style of bullfighting involves a physical contest with humans (and other animals) attempting to publicly subdue, immobilize, or kill a bull. The most common bull used is the Spanish Fighting Bull (Toro Bravo), a type of cattle native to the Iberian Peninsula. This style of bullfighting is seen to be both a sport and performance art. The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition \u2013 bulls are color blind. They attack moving objects; the brightly-colored cape is used to mask blood stains. In a traditional corrida, three toreros (or matadores) each \"fight\" against two out of a total of six \"fighting\" bulls to death, each bull being at least four years old and weighs up to about 600 kg (1,300 lb) (with a minimum weight limit of 460 kg (1,010 lb)). Bullfighting season in Spain runs from March to October. The practice is also known as a corrida de toros (\"bull-running\") or tauromaquia. Since the late-1980s, bullfighting in Spain has declined in popularity due to animal welfare concerns, its association with blood sport, and its links to nationalism. Most historians trace festivities involving bulls to prehistoric times, as a trend that once extended through the entire Mediterranean coast and has just survived in Iberia and part of France. Early bullfights had a high mortality rate. Alejandro Recio, a Spanish historian, considers the Neolithic city of Konya, Turkey, discovered by James Mellaart in 1958, as evidence of sacrificial tauromaquia associated with traditional rituals. This claim is based on the abundance of representations of bulls, as well as on the preservation of horns and bullheads attached to walls. Since then various archeological findings have proven the uninterrupted importance of the bull as a symbol of the sun for the Iberian cults, like the presence of berracos (known in Portuguese as berr\u00e3o), or the importance of the bull in the surviving Celtiberian and Celtic rituals that continued into the 21st century. These pre-Roman religions centered on the ritual sacrifice of sacred animals through direct or symbolic combat and was a likely motive for the depiction of bulls. Bullrings are believed to originate their bullfighting tradition from Roman gladiator games. During Roman Hispania gladiators were forced to fight animals by sword, such as bulls, bears, and wolves. The Romans tried to abolish and ban the \"puere\" practice of bullfighting, considering it was too risky for the youth and not a proper way to worship the state deities. According to Frommer's Travel Guide, bullfighting in Spain traces its origins to 711 CE, with the first official bullfight, or \"corrida de toros,\" being held in honor of the coronation of King Alfonso VIII. Once part of the Roman Empire, Spain owes its bullfighting tradition in part to gladiator games. At first, bullfighting was done on horseback and was reserved for Spanish aristocracy. During the Arab rule of Iberia, the ruling class tried to ban the practice of bullfighting, considering it a pagan celebration and heresy. Bullfighting was illegal in all Arab territory but became a mark of identity and resistance for Christian Iberians, especially for the nobility that started using it as a way to gain prestige. At first, bullfighting was done on horseback and was reserved for Spanish aristocracy; in contests the \"fighters\" were referred to as rejoneadores. In the 16th century Pope Pius V banned bullfighting for its ties to paganism and for the danger it posed to the participants. Anyone who would sponsor, watch or participate in a bullfight was to be excommunicated by the Church. Spanish and Portuguese bullfighters kept the tradition alive covertly, and his successor, Pope Gregory XIII, took efforts to relax this penalty. Pope Gregory advised bullfighters to not use the sport as way to honor Jesus Christ or the Saints, as was typical in Spain and Portugal. King Philip V, the first King of Spain of Bourbon descent, ended bullfighting in the country because he believed it was in poor taste for nobles to practice such a bloody sport. The change in bullfighting standards ran parallel to the discontent of the foreign rule of the Bourbons, and their lack of interest in understanding the politics, economics or culture of their new kingdom culminated in the Esquilache Riots of 1766. New forms of bullfighting continued to develop as decrees against the activity proved largely ineffective. After growing in popularity in Spain, King Carlos III attempted to ban bullfighting in 1771. He attempted to reduce the social tension by building two of the eldest and largest bullfighting rings in Madrid as part of an offensive to fix the resentment some nobles and other powerful\n\nquestion: Why are red muletas used in the final 3rd stage of the bullfight?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The red muletas are used to mask blood stains.", "usage": 1155}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

King Charles IV attempted to formally ban the sport again after his predecessor made concessions. King Joseph Bonaparte reversed this decision by hosting a bullfight during his coronation in 1808. Joaqu\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Costillares (1743\u20131800) was a Spanish bullfighter from Seville who has been credited with founding modern Spanish-style bullfighting. He established the \"cuadrillas tradition\" where teams of two or three banderilleros and two picadors taunt the bull. He also organized the tercios de lidia (\"thirds of fight\") borrowed from the theatre; invented the Veronica and other basic cape movements as well as the current traje de luces (\"suit of light\"); and created the cape maneuvers (muleta), typical in this style of bullfighting since the 19th century. Each matador has six assistants\u2014two picadores (\"lancers\") mounted on horseback, three banderilleros (\"flagmen\"), and a mozo de espada (\"the lad of the swords\"). Collectively they compose a cuadrilla or team of bullfighters. The crew also includes an ayuda (aide to sword servant) and subalternos (subordinates) including at least two peones (pages, singular pe\u00f3n). The modern Spanish-style bullfight (corrida, \"run\") is highly standardized, with three distinct parts (tercios, \"thirds\"), the start of each of which is announced by a trumpet sound. The participants first enter the arena in a parade (pase\u00edllo) to salute the presiding dignitary (presidente), usually accompanied by band music. The corrida begins to the tune of live-played pasodobles, many of which were composed to honour famous toreros. Torero costumes are influenced by 17th century Andalusian clothing. Matadors are distinguished by a \"suit of lights\" (traje de luces), custom-made and embroidered with silver or golden thread. The bull then enters the ring to be tested for aggressiveness by the matador and banderilleros with the magenta and gold capote (dress cape). Bulls are raised on the open range by specialist breeding estates called ganader\u00eda. The bull enters the arena with a rosette on its back bearing the colours of the estate of its origin. The first stage is called the tercio de varas (\"third of lances\"). The matador observes how the bull reacts to the waving of the banderilleros' cloak. They also note vision problems, unusual head movements, or if the bull favors a part of the ring called a querencia (territory). A bull trying to reach its querencia is often more dangerous than a bull that is attacking the cape directly. The initial attack by the matador is called the suerte de capote (\"act of the cape\"), and there are a number of fundamental \"lances\" (or passes) that matadors make; the most common being the ver\u00f3nica (named after Saint Veronica), which is the act of a matador letting their cloak trail over the bull's head as it runs past. Then two picadores enter the arena each armed with a lance (vara), mounted on large heavily-padded and blindfolded horses. The entrance of the horse attracts the bull to the picadores. The picadores repeatedly drive their lances into the muscles (morrillo) of the bull's neck to weaken the animal. As the picadores stab the bull's neck, the bull charges and attempts to lift the picador's horse. If the picador is successful, the bull will hold its head and horns lower as a result of injury and weakness during the following stages of the fight. This makes the bull less dangerous to enable the matador to perform the passes of modern bullfighting. In a mandatory step in the corrida, regulations require that a plaza judge ensures a certain number of hits are made before it is considered completed. In the next stage \u2013 the tercio de banderillas (\"third of small flag\") \u2013 the matador attempts to plant two barbed or dart-like sticks known as banderillas (\"little flags\") onto the bull's shoulders. These weaken the ridges of neck and shoulder muscle (which set fighting bulls apart from cattle) through loss of blood, while also spurring the bull into making more aggressive charges. By this point the bull has lost a significant amount of blood, exhausting the animal. The matador then enters with his cape and sword, attempting to tire the bull further with several runs at the cape. The matadors place the banderillas around the bull. If the presidente decides that the bull is relatively weak or unwilling to fight, they may order the use of black banderillas, considered to be a poor reflection on the breeder. In the third\n\nquestion: Why are red muletas used in the final 3rd stage of the bullfight?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "To tire the bull and weaken the animal.", "usage": 1104}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This cape is stretched with a wooden dowel and, in right-handed passes, the sword as well. Having dedicated the bull to an individual or the whole audience, the matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a series of passes, demonstrating their control over it. The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition \u2013 bulls are color blind. The movement of the cape is what irritates bulls; the colour by itself has the purpose of masking blood stains. The faena is the entire performance combined with the muleta, which is usually broken down into a series of tandas (episodes). A typical tanda consists of three to five basic passes and then the finishing touch (remate), such as a pase de pecho, or pase de desprecio. Well-received passes are celebrated by the audience with shouts of \"\u00a1ole!\". The faena ends with a final series of passes in which the matador with a muleta attempts to manoeuvre the bull into a position to stab it between the shoulder blades and through the aorta or heart. The entire part of the bullfight with the muleta is called the tercio de muerte (\"third of death\") or suerte de muleta (\"act of muleta\"). The act of thrusting the sword (estoca or estoque) is called an estocada. A clumsy estocada that fails to give a \"quick and clean death\" will often raise loud protests from the crowd and may ruin the whole performance. If estocada is not successful, the matador must then perform a descabello and cut the bull's spinal cord with a second sword called verdugo, to kill it instantly and spare the animal pain. Although the matador's final blow is usually fatal, it may take the bull some time to die. A coup de gr\u00e2ce is therefore administered by a pe\u00f3n named a puntillero, using a dagger to further pierce the spinal cord. The matador must kill the bull in 15 minutes after the first muleta pass, at most. After 10 minutes, if the bull is still alive, the presidente will order an aviso, a warning given with a trumpet sound. If a further three minutes elapse, a second aviso will be given; a third and final aviso is given after a further two minutes. The presidente will then give an order to have the bull returned to its pen (corral), or, if local law so requires, to have the bull killed outside the ring. It is a dishonor for the failing matador. The bull's body is dragged out by a team of mules. If the presidente is impressed by the performance of the bull, he orders a tour around the ring to honour the animal. Very rarely, a bull will be allowed to survive a fight as an indulgence granted in recognition of an exceptional performance. The spectators will demand an indulto from the presidente, by waving handkerchiefs before the estocada. The matador will stop and look at the presidente. If he stands still, he will resume their action and kill the bull. But if he has an orange handkerchief hung on his balcony, the matador will imitate the estocada with a banderilla or with the palm of his hand and the bull will be \"freed\". Such bulls are generally retired from competition and raised as studs, as their experience in the ring makes them extremely dangerous opponents. A fighting bull is never used in the ring twice, because they learn from experience, and the entire strategy of the matador is based on the assumption that the bull has not learned from previous experience. This also invalidates bulls who have been run in their estate by illegal fighters (maletillas), who in earlier times would sneak into an estate by night to practice their skills. A trofeo (trophy) is the usual indicator of a successful faena. When the records of bullfights are kept, trofeos earned by the matador are always mentioned. If the crowd demands, the matador is allowed to take a lap of victory around the ring. If at least half of the spectators petition the presidente by waving handkerchiefs, the presidente is obliged to award the matador with one ear of the bull. To award the matador with another ear or with two ears and the tail (los m\u00e1ximos trofeos), depends solely on the presidente's appreciation. A matador who won at least two ears is given the permission to be carried on the shoulders of the admirers (salida en hombros). In some cities, such as Seville,\n\nquestion: Why are red muletas used in the final 3rd stage of the bullfight?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition \u2013 bulls are color blind.", "usage": 1112}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In general, a matador that faces a bull that is freed is usually awarded los m\u00e1ximos trofeos, although only symbolically; ears or the tail can only be physically cut off of a dead bull. Bullfighting is normally fatal for the bull, and it is dangerous for the matador. Picadors and banderilleros are sometimes gored, but this is not common. The suertes with the capote are risky, but it is the faena, in particular the estocada, that is the most dangerous. A matador of classical (Manolete) style is trained to divert the bull with the muleta but to come close to the right horn as he makes the fatal sword-thrust between the scapulae and through the aorta. At this moment, the danger to the matador is the greatest. Most matadors have been gored many times. A special type of surgeon has developed, in Spain and elsewhere, to treat cornadas, or horn-wounds. The bullring normally has an infirmary with an operating room, reserved for the immediate treatment of matadors with cornadas. The bullring has a chapel where a matador can pray before the corrida and where a priest can be found in case an emergency sacrament of extreme unction (also known as Anointing of the Sick or Last Rites) is needed. A poll conducted in 2014\u20132015 by the Spanish Ministry of Culture places bullfighting 10th in the list of most popular paid leisure activities. In 2015 9.5% of Spaniards went to a paid bullfight. By Autonomous Communities, Navarre headed the list, followed by Castile-Leon, Aragon, La Rioja, Castile-La Mancha and Extremadura. The regions least interested in bullfighting were Galicia, the Canary Islands, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. According to the poll, during the 2014\u201315 period 9.5% of the potential audience (Spaniards aged 15 and higher) would have attended a corrida at least once; this amounts to over 3.5 million people. The history of female bullfighters participating in Spanish-style bullfighting has been traced to the sport's earliest renditions, namely during the late-1700s and early 1800s. Francisco Goya, an 18th-century Spanish painter, first depicted a female bullfighter in his work La Pajuelera, which featured a woman sparring with a bull on horseback. The Spanish government banned women from participating in the sport from 1909 to 1934, following the Second Spanish Republic's liberation of women until 1939. On 10 August 1974, under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, women were once again allowed to bullfight. Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Hern\u00e1ndez G\u00f3mez was the first woman to earn her bullfighting license (torera) after the ban was lifted. During the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, women were forced to exile in other Spanish-speaking countries and the United States in order to continue bullfighting. Throughout the 1980s women had difficulty completing their alternativa, a ceremony where a bullfighter becomes a matador, due to the social pressures of the decade. Activism against bullfighting has existed in Spain since the beginning of the early 20th century, when a group of intellectuals, belonging to the Generation of '98, rallied against the popularity of bullfighting and other social issues, dismissing them as \"non-European\" elements of Spanish culture, which were to blame for the country's social and economic backwardness. In the 21st century, bullfighting has come under increasing attack from animal rights activists and political actors for its links to Spanish nationalism. Separatist and nationalist sentiment in Catalonia has played a key role in the region-wide ban of a practice which is strongly associated to Spanish national identity. However the bous al carrer runnings of the bulls are not banned. Galician and Basque nationalists have also expressed abolitionist stances, although in the case of the latter this has been somewhat mooted by the conundrum of bullfighting being at the heart of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona. Animal welfare concerns are perhaps the prime driver of opposition to bullfighting outside Spain, although rejection of traditionalism and Criollo elitism may also play a role in Latin America. In the Canary Islands, bullfights are banned but cock fights, banned in the rest of Spain, are popular. Animal rights activists claim bullfighting is a cruel or barbarous blood sport, in which the bull suffers severe stress and a slow, torturous death.

Other arguments in favor of bullfighting include those to the effect that the death of animals in slaughterhouses is often much worse than the death in the ring, and that both types of animal die for entertainment since humans do not need to consume meat, eating it instead for taste (bulls enter the food chain after the bullfight). The last common defense to the practice is the conservationist standpoint for both the tradition itself and the Bravo bull variety, as Bravo bulls are the closest living relative to the European wild bull, completely extinct now and divided into sub-breeds whose only use is provision of meat and milk, serving the food industry. After years of increased pressure against bullfighting by abolitionist movements within Spain, the death of bullfighter Victor Barrio in July 2016 led to hundreds of comments being posted on various social media expressing joy towards the event and openly mocking his family and widow. This led to a significant backlash within Spain against anti-bullfighting activism, and criminal investigations are ongoing against those involved. Within a few days of Barrio's death, over 200,000 signatures had been collected demanding action be taken against one such activist. Tercio de varas: Suerte de capote.

Actually, it doesn\u2019t. Bulls, along with all other cattle, are color-blind to red. Thus, the bull is likely irritated not by the muleta\u2019s color, but by the cape\u2019s movement as the matador whips it around. In support of this is the fact that a bull charges the matador\u2019s other cape \u2014 the larger capote \u2014 with equal fury. Yet this cape is magenta on one side and gold or blue on the other.

In 2007, the Discovery Channel\u2019s MythBusters tested a live bull on color versus movement in three separate experiments. First, they put three stationary flags, which were red, blue and white, in the bull\u2019s enclosure. The bull charged all three flags regardless of color. Next, they put three dummies dressed in red, blue and white in the ring, and again the bull charged all three without discrimination (and actually charged the red dummy last). Finally, they put a live person dressed in red in the ring with the bull. That person stood still while two cowboys \u2014 not in red \u2014 moved around the ring. The bull went after the moving cowboys and left the motionless red-clad person alone. So, if a bull can\u2019t see red, why is the muleta red?

In fact, the muleta is only used in the final 3rd of a bullfight The matador uses it to hide his sword, and he pierces the bull as it charges past. The cape is traditionally red to mask the bloodstains. Matadors became national heroes because of their courage and their ability to be in front of a bull. Most matadors came from a working-class background, and they came to symbolize the popular hero, especially at a time when working class people didn\u2019t have a place in society. What do matadors wear under their pants? The traje de luces (\u2018suit of lights\u2019) is the traditional clothing that Spanish bullfighters (toreros, picadores, and rejoneadores) wear in the bullring. The term originates from the sequins and reflective threads of gold or silver. Why do matadors wear pink socks? The electric pink socks, that supposedly indicate wealth as well as serve to rile the bulls up for a good fight.

Contrary to popular belief, bulls are not angered by the colour red. You\u2019ve almost certainly heard the myth that bulls will go crazy at the sight of anything red.

But not only is this trope overdone, it\u2019s completely incorrect. These clich\u00e9s stem from matadors\u2019 use of muletas (red capes) to taunt bulls into an ill-advised charge. However, the cape\u2019s colour is not for the bull, it\u2019s for the spectators. A red cape masks the blood of the bull during the finale of a bullfight when the matador finally puts down the bull and ends the fight. With a red cape, the spectacle looks a lot less violent and bloody than it really is, in the hopes that it will be more enjoyable for those watching. The cause of the bull\u2019s anger is not the redness of the cape. That would actually be the cape\u2019s motion. A cape of any colour could cause the bull to charge as long as the bullfighter waves it the same way. In fact, bulls are colour-blind. They only have 2 cones (colour receptors) in their eyes, whereas humans have 3. Bulls, like other ungulates (animals with hooves), have dichromatic vision. They have two different cone cells, those cells in the retina that detect color. One type of cone cell detect short wavelengths (S-cone) that is most sensitive at 444 to 445 nm (blue/violet region). The other type of cone cells perceive medium to long wavelengths at around 552-555 nm (yellowish-green). Since red light has a wavelength of around 650 nm, the bulls would only be able to see the capes in shades of grey. Rate This Biscuit Average rating / 5. Vote count: No ratings so far!

This style of bullfighting involves a physical contest with humans (and other animals) attempting to publicly subdue, immobilize, or kill a bull. The most common bull used is the Spanish Fighting Bull (Toro Bravo), a type of cattle native to the Iberian Peninsula. This style of bullfighting is seen to be both a sport and performance art. The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition \u2013 bulls are color blind. They attack moving objects; the brightly-colored cape is used to mask blood stains. In a traditional corrida, three toreros (or matadores) each \"fight\" against two out of a total of six \"fighting\" bulls to death, each bull being at least four years old and weighs up to about 600 kg (1,300 lb) (with a minimum weight limit of 460 kg (1,010 lb)). Bullfighting season in Spain runs from March to October. The practice is also known as a corrida de toros (\"bull-running\") or tauromaquia. Since the late-1980s, bullfighting in Spain has declined in popularity due to animal welfare concerns, its association with blood sport, and its links to nationalism. Most historians trace festivities involving bulls to prehistoric times, as a trend that once extended through the entire Mediterranean coast and has just survived in Iberia and part of France. Early bullfights had a high mortality rate. Alejandro Recio, a Spanish historian, considers the Neolithic city of Konya, Turkey, discovered by James Mellaart in 1958, as evidence of sacrificial tauromaquia associated with traditional rituals. This claim is based on the abundance of representations of bulls, as well as on the preservation of horns and bullheads attached to walls. Since then various archeological findings have proven the uninterrupted importance of the bull as a symbol of the sun for the Iberian cults, like the presence of berracos (known in Portuguese as berr\u00e3o), or the importance of the bull in the surviving Celtiberian and Celtic rituals that continued into the 21st century. These pre-Roman religions centered on the ritual sacrifice of sacred animals through direct or symbolic combat and was a likely motive for the depiction of bulls. Bullrings are believed to originate their bullfighting tradition from Roman gladiator games. During Roman Hispania gladiators were forced to fight animals by sword, such as bulls, bears, and wolves. The Romans tried to abolish and ban the \"puere\" practice of bullfighting, considering it was too risky for the youth and not a proper way to worship the state deities. According to Frommer's Travel Guide, bullfighting in Spain traces its origins to 711 CE, with the first official bullfight, or \"corrida de toros,\" being held in honor of the coronation of King Alfonso VIII. Once part of the Roman Empire, Spain owes its bullfighting tradition in part to gladiator games. At first, bullfighting was done on horseback and was reserved for Spanish aristocracy. During the Arab rule of Iberia, the ruling class tried to ban the practice of bullfighting, considering it a pagan celebration and heresy. Bullfighting was illegal in all Arab territory but became a mark of identity and resistance for Christian Iberians, especially for the nobility that started using it as a way to gain prestige. At first, bullfighting was done on horseback and was reserved for Spanish aristocracy; in contests the \"fighters\" were referred to as rejoneadores. In the 16th century Pope Pius V banned bullfighting for its ties to paganism and for the danger it posed to the participants. Anyone who would sponsor, watch or participate in a bullfight was to be excommunicated by the Church. Spanish and Portuguese bullfighters kept the tradition alive covertly, and his successor, Pope Gregory XIII, took efforts to relax this penalty. Pope Gregory advised bullfighters to not use the sport as way to honor Jesus Christ or the Saints, as was typical in Spain and Portugal. King Philip V, the first King of Spain of Bourbon descent, ended bullfighting in the country because he believed it was in poor taste for nobles to practice such a bloody sport. The change in bullfighting standards ran parallel to the discontent of the foreign rule of the Bourbons, and their lack of interest in understanding the politics, economics or culture of their new kingdom culminated in the Esquilache Riots of 1766. New forms of bullfighting continued to develop as decrees against the activity proved largely ineffective. After growing in popularity in Spain, King Carlos III attempted to ban bullfighting in 1771. He attempted to reduce the social tension by building two of the eldest and largest bullfighting rings in Madrid as part of an offensive to fix the resentment some nobles and other powerful\n\nquestion: What do bulls chase after in a bullfight?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1136}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

King Charles IV attempted to formally ban the sport again after his predecessor made concessions. King Joseph Bonaparte reversed this decision by hosting a bullfight during his coronation in 1808. Joaqu\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Costillares (1743\u20131800) was a Spanish bullfighter from Seville who has been credited with founding modern Spanish-style bullfighting. He established the \"cuadrillas tradition\" where teams of two or three banderilleros and two picadors taunt the bull. He also organized the tercios de lidia (\"thirds of fight\") borrowed from the theatre; invented the Veronica and other basic cape movements as well as the current traje de luces (\"suit of light\"); and created the cape maneuvers (muleta), typical in this style of bullfighting since the 19th century. Each matador has six assistants\u2014two picadores (\"lancers\") mounted on horseback, three banderilleros (\"flagmen\"), and a mozo de espada (\"the lad of the swords\"). Collectively they compose a cuadrilla or team of bullfighters. The crew also includes an ayuda (aide to sword servant) and subalternos (subordinates) including at least two peones (pages, singular pe\u00f3n). The modern Spanish-style bullfight (corrida, \"run\") is highly standardized, with three distinct parts (tercios, \"thirds\"), the start of each of which is announced by a trumpet sound. The participants first enter the arena in a parade (pase\u00edllo) to salute the presiding dignitary (presidente), usually accompanied by band music. The corrida begins to the tune of live-played pasodobles, many of which were composed to honour famous toreros. Torero costumes are influenced by 17th century Andalusian clothing. Matadors are distinguished by a \"suit of lights\" (traje de luces), custom-made and embroidered with silver or golden thread. The bull then enters the ring to be tested for aggressiveness by the matador and banderilleros with the magenta and gold capote (dress cape). Bulls are raised on the open range by specialist breeding estates called ganader\u00eda. The bull enters the arena with a rosette on its back bearing the colours of the estate of its origin. The first stage is called the tercio de varas (\"third of lances\"). The matador observes how the bull reacts to the waving of the banderilleros' cloak. They also note vision problems, unusual head movements, or if the bull favors a part of the ring called a querencia (territory). A bull trying to reach its querencia is often more dangerous than a bull that is attacking the cape directly. The initial attack by the matador is called the suerte de capote (\"act of the cape\"), and there are a number of fundamental \"lances\" (or passes) that matadors make; the most common being the ver\u00f3nica (named after Saint Veronica), which is the act of a matador letting their cloak trail over the bull's head as it runs past. Then two picadores enter the arena each armed with a lance (vara), mounted on large heavily-padded and blindfolded horses. The entrance of the horse attracts the bull to the picadores. The picadores repeatedly drive their lances into the muscles (morrillo) of the bull's neck to weaken the animal. As the picadores stab the bull's neck, the bull charges and attempts to lift the picador's horse. If the picador is successful, the bull will hold its head and horns lower as a result of injury and weakness during the following stages of the fight. This makes the bull less dangerous to enable the matador to perform the passes of modern bullfighting. In a mandatory step in the corrida, regulations require that a plaza judge ensures a certain number of hits are made before it is considered completed. In the next stage \u2013 the tercio de banderillas (\"third of small flag\") \u2013 the matador attempts to plant two barbed or dart-like sticks known as banderillas (\"little flags\") onto the bull's shoulders. These weaken the ridges of neck and shoulder muscle (which set fighting bulls apart from cattle) through loss of blood, while also spurring the bull into making more aggressive charges. By this point the bull has lost a significant amount of blood, exhausting the animal. The matador then enters with his cape and sword, attempting to tire the bull further with several runs at the cape. The matadors place the banderillas around the bull. If the presidente decides that the bull is relatively weak or unwilling to fight, they may order the use of black banderillas, considered to be a poor reflection on the breeder.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Use of Red Capes in Bullfighting\n\nevidence:  and final stage \u2013 the tercio de muerte (\"third of death\") \u2013 the matador re-enters the ring alone with a small red cape or muleta in one hand and a sword (estoc) in the other. This cape is stretched with a wooden dowel and, in right-handed passes, the sword as well. Having dedicated the bull to an individual or the whole audience, the matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a series of passes, demonstrating their control over it. The red colour of the cape is a matter of tradition \u2013 bulls are color blind. The movement of the cape is what irritates bulls; the colour by itself has the purpose of masking blood stains. The faena is the entire performance combined with the muleta, which is usually broken down into a series of tandas (episodes). A typical tanda consists of three to five basic passes and then the finishing touch (remate), such as a pase de pecho, or pase de desprecio. Well-received passes are celebrated by the audience with shouts of \"\u00a1ole!\". The faena ends with a final series of passes in which the matador with a muleta attempts to manoeuvre the bull into a position to stab it between the shoulder blades and through the aorta or heart. The entire part of the bullfight with the muleta is called the tercio de muerte (\"third of death\") or suerte de muleta (\"act of muleta\"). The act of thrusting the sword (estoca or estoque) is called an estocada. A clumsy estocada that fails to give a \"quick and clean death\" will often raise loud protests from the crowd and may ruin the whole performance. If estocada is not successful, the matador must then perform a descabello and cut the bull's spinal cord with a second sword called verdugo, to kill it instantly and spare the animal pain. Although the matador's final blow is usually fatal, it may take the bull some time to die. A coup de gr\u00e2ce is therefore administered by a pe\u00f3n named a puntillero, using a dagger to further pierce the spinal cord. The matador must kill the bull in 15 minutes after the first muleta pass, at most. After 10 minutes, if the bull is still alive, the presidente will order an aviso, a warning given with a trumpet sound. If a further three minutes elapse, a second aviso will be given; a third and final aviso is given after a further two minutes. The presidente will then give an order to have the bull returned to its pen (corral), or, if local law so requires, to have the bull killed outside the ring. It is a dishonor for the failing matador. The bull's body is dragged out by a team of mules. If the presidente is impressed by the performance of the bull, he orders a tour around the ring to honour the animal. Very rarely, a bull will be allowed to survive a fight as an indulgence granted in recognition of an exceptional performance. The spectators will demand an indulto from the presidente, by waving handkerchiefs before the estocada. The matador will stop and look at the presidente. If he stands still, he will resume their action and kill the bull. But if he has an orange handkerchief hung on his balcony, the matador will imitate the estocada with a banderilla or with the palm of his hand and the bull will be \"freed\". Such bulls are generally retired from competition and raised as studs, as their experience in the ring makes them extremely dangerous opponents. A fighting bull is never used in the ring twice, because they learn from experience, and the entire strategy of the matador is based on the assumption that the bull has not learned from previous experience. This also invalidates bulls who have been run in their estate by illegal fighters (maletillas), who in earlier times would sneak into an estate by night to practice their skills. A trofeo (trophy) is the usual indicator of a successful faena. When the records of bullfights are kept, trofeos earned by the matador are always mentioned. If the crowd demands, the matador is allowed to take a lap of victory around the ring. If at least half of the spectators petition the presidente by waving handkerchiefs, the presidente is obliged to award the matador with one ear of the bull. To award the matador with another ear or with two ears and the tail (los m\u00e1ximos trofeos), depends solely on the presidente's appreciation. A matador who won at least two ears is given the permission to be carried on the shoulders of the admirers (salida en hombros). In some cities, such as Seville,\n\nquestion: What do bulls chase after in a bullfight?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "small red cape or muleta", "usage": 1093}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Use of Red Capes in Bullfighting\n\nevidence:  three matadors take on two bulls each, and salida en hombros is only available to a matador that wins a total of three trofeos between his two bulls. In general, a matador that faces a bull that is freed is usually awarded los m\u00e1ximos trofeos, although only symbolically; ears or the tail can only be physically cut off of a dead bull. Bullfighting is normally fatal for the bull, and it is dangerous for the matador. Picadors and banderilleros are sometimes gored, but this is not common. The suertes with the capote are risky, but it is the faena, in particular the estocada, that is the most dangerous. A matador of classical (Manolete) style is trained to divert the bull with the muleta but to come close to the right horn as he makes the fatal sword-thrust between the scapulae and through the aorta. At this moment, the danger to the matador is the greatest. Most matadors have been gored many times. A special type of surgeon has developed, in Spain and elsewhere, to treat cornadas, or horn-wounds. The bullring normally has an infirmary with an operating room, reserved for the immediate treatment of matadors with cornadas. The bullring has a chapel where a matador can pray before the corrida and where a priest can be found in case an emergency sacrament of extreme unction (also known as Anointing of the Sick or Last Rites) is needed. A poll conducted in 2014\u20132015 by the Spanish Ministry of Culture places bullfighting 10th in the list of most popular paid leisure activities. In 2015 9.5% of Spaniards went to a paid bullfight. By Autonomous Communities, Navarre headed the list, followed by Castile-Leon, Aragon, La Rioja, Castile-La Mancha and Extremadura. The regions least interested in bullfighting were Galicia, the Canary Islands, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. According to the poll, during the 2014\u201315 period 9.5% of the potential audience (Spaniards aged 15 and higher) would have attended a corrida at least once; this amounts to over 3.5 million people. The history of female bullfighters participating in Spanish-style bullfighting has been traced to the sport's earliest renditions, namely during the late-1700s and early 1800s. Francisco Goya, an 18th-century Spanish painter, first depicted a female bullfighter in his work La Pajuelera, which featured a woman sparring with a bull on horseback. The Spanish government banned women from participating in the sport from 1909 to 1934, following the Second Spanish Republic's liberation of women until 1939. On 10 August 1974, under the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, women were once again allowed to bullfight. Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Hern\u00e1ndez G\u00f3mez was the first woman to earn her bullfighting license (torera) after the ban was lifted. During the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, women were forced to exile in other Spanish-speaking countries and the United States in order to continue bullfighting. Throughout the 1980s women had difficulty completing their alternativa, a ceremony where a bullfighter becomes a matador, due to the social pressures of the decade. Activism against bullfighting has existed in Spain since the beginning of the early 20th century, when a group of intellectuals, belonging to the Generation of '98, rallied against the popularity of bullfighting and other social issues, dismissing them as \"non-European\" elements of Spanish culture, which were to blame for the country's social and economic backwardness. In the 21st century, bullfighting has come under increasing attack from animal rights activists and political actors for its links to Spanish nationalism. Separatist and nationalist sentiment in Catalonia has played a key role in the region-wide ban of a practice which is strongly associated to Spanish national identity. However the bous al carrer runnings of the bulls are not banned. Galician and Basque nationalists have also expressed abolitionist stances, although in the case of the latter this has been somewhat mooted by the conundrum of bullfighting being at the heart of the San Fermin festival in Pamplona. Animal welfare concerns are perhaps the prime driver of opposition to bullfighting outside Spain, although rejection of traditionalism and Criollo elitism may also play a role in Latin America. In the Canary Islands, bullfights are banned but cock fights, banned in the rest of Spain, are popular. Animal rights activists claim bullfighting is a cruel or barbarous blood sport, in which the bull suffers severe stress and a slow, torturous death. A number of animal rights or animal welfare activist groups such as Antitauromaquia (\"Antibullfighting\") and StopOurShame\n\nquestion: What do bulls chase after in a bullfight?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1130}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Other arguments in favor of bullfighting include those to the effect that the death of animals in slaughterhouses is often much worse than the death in the ring, and that both types of animal die for entertainment since humans do not need to consume meat, eating it instead for taste (bulls enter the food chain after the bullfight). The last common defense to the practice is the conservationist standpoint for both the tradition itself and the Bravo bull variety, as Bravo bulls are the closest living relative to the European wild bull, completely extinct now and divided into sub-breeds whose only use is provision of meat and milk, serving the food industry. After years of increased pressure against bullfighting by abolitionist movements within Spain, the death of bullfighter Victor Barrio in July 2016 led to hundreds of comments being posted on various social media expressing joy towards the event and openly mocking his family and widow. This led to a significant backlash within Spain against anti-bullfighting activism, and criminal investigations are ongoing against those involved. Within a few days of Barrio's death, over 200,000 signatures had been collected demanding action be taken against one such activist. Tercio de varas: Suerte de capote.
