On the back, too, there is sometimes a Chinese language lesson. Whether you believe in the fortunes or the lucky numbers is irrelevant, as fortune cookies are an integral part of an American Chinese meal that will likely not go away any time soon... if ever.

Let's get the most pressing point out of the way first \u2014 the historical roots of fortune cookies are not Chinese at all. Instead, research points to Japan as the source of what would become fortune cookies as they are known today. According to researcher Yasuko Nakamachi \u2014 who was interviewed by Jennifer 8. Lee, author of The Fortune CookieChronicles \u2013 fortune cookies can trace their origins to bakeries outside of Kyoto, Japan. Nakamachi's proof lies in family bakeries that surround Kyoto and the fact that they made fortune cookie-shaped crackers. Further, there is visual evidence (an image from the 1870s) that shows a baker making them in his bakery. Nakamachi first saw fortune cookies while in a Chinese restaurant in New York City, but after seeing someone making them at a bakery in Japan \u2014 complete with a piece of paper tucked inside \u2014 it set her off on a quest to find the fortune cookie's true origins. The main differences between Japanese and American fortune cookies, she found, were in the size, the flavoring, and the position of the fortune. These Japanese cookies were bigger, used sesame and miso (not vanilla and butter), and had the fortunes pinched in the mouth (not folded inside).

On this day, mooncakes were distributed widely. The cakes, which were made with a lotus nut paste, were avoided by the Mongol overlords because they didn't like the taste. The Chinese used this to their advantage, hiding instructions for rebellion inside the mooncakes and sending priests inside the occupied city's walls to distribute them. Once the instructions were distributed, the rebels were able to surprise the Mongols and overthrow them. This well-thought out plan and hard-fought victory led to the establishment of the storied Ming Dynasty, which ruled from 1368 all the way until 1644 C.E., when the Qing Dynasty took over following the last Ming Emperor Ch\u00f3ngzh\u0113n's suicide (via History).

While the cookie's historic roots can be traced to Japan, and the idea of the fortune inside a cookie can be traced even further back to 1300s China, the fortune cookie known today is believed to have been invented in 1900s California. Japanese immigration to the United States was a slow and steady process, with communities slowly popping up in various places (such as Japan Town in San Francisco) along the West Coast. As the 1900s began, more and more Japanese people started moving stateside, taking jobs first on farms or other places of hard labor. Some eventually were able to open their own businesses, and more, leading to even more population growth. It is within this context that fortune cookies were invented. There are two sites that claim ownership over the founding city of the fortune cookie. On one hand, you have San Francisco, and on the other, you have Los Angeles (via American Heritage). Both cities had growing (and engaged) Japanese populations in the early 1900s, with plenty of places \u2014 bakeries, for example \u2014 where the cookies may have originated.

Like many famous foods/objects/really anything throughout history, the actual inventor of the fortune cookie is a hotly contested subject. There are two main contenders for the title of fortune cookie inventor. First, there is Makoto Hagiwara. Hagiwara was a Japanese immigrant who was (as of 1895) employed as the caretaker for San Francisco's Japanese Tea Gardens. Then, sometime between 1907 and 1909, Hagiwara began serving cookies based on Japanese senbei (toasted rice wafers) to visitors of the garden. Allegedly, the cookies contained thank you notes which acknowledged the public for having him re-hired at the gardens after Mayor James Phelan \u2014 who was a known racist and hated people of Asian descent \u2014 fired him.

In an effort to put the Los Angeles\u2013San Francisco rivalry to rest and state for the record who actually invented the fortune cookie, the Court of Historical Review \u2013 a San Francisco-based organization \u2014 held a trial in 1983. Shockingly \u2014 or perhaps not, if you consider where the Court of Historical Review is based \u2013 it was decided that Makoto Hagiwara was the inventor and the city of San Francisco the home of the fortune cookie. During the trial, the man overseeing the case (a real federal judge named Daniel M. Hanlon), was allegedly given a fortune cookie that read, \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. not very smart cookie.\" It is one thing to hold a \"trial\" to decide an answer to something like the founding of a food, but no matter how you look at it, the trial was a product of the time. Participants in the trial not only donned clothing designed to look like ancient Chinese robes, but they also spoke in a pidgin English while recounting each claimant's history of the cookie. (Other evidence was issued as well, such as a set of grills that were used to create the cookies.) To this day, San Franciscans and Angelenos still don't agree on who actually invented the fortune cookie.

Fortune cookies as a staple in American Chinese restaurants really took hold in and around World War II. This transition from Japanese-American to Chinese-American prominence, though, is not because of a happy, seamless, peaceful shift. During World War II, Japanese-Americans were put in internment camps in the United States (this was a response by President Franklin Roosevelt and the U.S. government to the attack on Pearl Harbor). Without Japanese-Americans producing fortune cookies, it was during this time that enterprising Chinese businessmen decided to start making cookies of their own and selling them to Chinese restaurants.

This transition from Japanese-American to Chinese-American prominence, though, is not because of a happy, seamless, peaceful shift. During World War II, Japanese-Americans were put in internment camps in the United States (this was a response by President Franklin Roosevelt and the U.S. government to the attack on Pearl Harbor). Without Japanese-Americans producing fortune cookies, it was during this time that enterprising Chinese businessmen decided to start making cookies of their own and selling them to Chinese restaurants. This started the proliferation of fortune cookies that has maintained a steady increase through the present day. When soldiers came home from war \u2014 and even more so as American families began to dine out in the 1950s and beyond \u2014 the wish for something sweet after dinner was great. And since Chinese cuisine did not have many sweet dessert options (compared to, say, French or Italian cuisines), restaurateurs offered up Fortune cookies, which were promptly cracked open and gobbled up. From the time of their invention in the early 1900s through the middle of the century, fortune cookies were made by hand. Once mixed, fortune cookie dough would be poured onto a tray, heated, and shaped as the fortunes were put inside. While it only takes about a minute to cook fortune cookies, this time really adds up when you're doing the entire process by hand. This process was kept up until one enterprising man by the name of Edward Louie. Louie, who opened San Francisco's Lotus Fortune Cookie Company in 1946, decided he needed to find a way to save his family the trouble of individually wrapping hundreds if not thousands of fortunes cookies every day. He set to work and in the 1960s invented a machine that automated the process by inserting the fortune cookie and folding it together. This machine allowed Lotus to create up to 90,000 fortune cookies per day, further boosting the ability to find fortune cookies far and wide.

Even with the advent of fortune cookie automation \u2014 which boosted production to 90,000 cookies per day \u2014 it is nothing compared to the number of cookies being produced currently. In total, around 3 billion fortune cookies are produced per year. That's an average of around nine cookies per person in the United States per year. Now, these are not only intended for Chinese restaurants. In fact, fortune cookies have been used as a promotional device for a variety of things for years. The movie Kung Fu Panda 3, for example, created a slew of fortune cookies with quotations from the movie's protagonist Po (voiced by Jack Black). Before Kung Fu Panda, other movies such as Billy Wilder's 1966 comedy The Fortune Cookie (starring Walter Matthau and Jack Lemon in their first on-screen collaboration) also used fortune cookies as promotional items.

Okay, so considering your fortune may sometimes read \"you will find the love of your life\" or some other such platitude, it might be hard to believe that the numbers contained on fortunes are lucky, but research says that they actually might be. In 2017, statistics website FiveThirtyEight bought 1,035 Panda-brand cookies in order to analyze the lucky numbers held within. There were 676 unique fortunes in the lot and 556 combinations of lucky numbers. Then, they analyzed the Powerball numbers for every drawing between Nov. 1, 1997 and May 27, 2017. The results were surprising. If a person bought a ticket every day during that time, they would've spent $4.2 million. Then, if they used every possible combination, they would've netted a grand total of around $4.4 million dollars. If they had used random numbers in that time, they would've only won $1.7 million (while still spending $4.2 million). In fact, there was even a brief investigation into Wonton Food when, on March 30, 2005, over 100 people from 29 states got five of six numbers right, netting the group over $19 million dollars total.

It\u2019s customary in many restaurants for diners to receive a small treat with their check: mints, hard candy and sometimes even chocolate. But at many Chinese restaurants around the United States, patrons get something a little different: a Pac-Man-shaped, vanilla-flavored cookie containing a finger-sized slip of paper printed with a pithy fortune or aphorism. While many Americans associate these fortune cookies with Chinese restaurants\u2014and by extension, Chinese culture\u2014they are actually more readily traceable to 19th-century Japan and 20th-century America. As far back as the 1870s, some confectionary shops near Kyoto, Japan carried a cracker with the same folded shape and a fortune tucked into the bend, instead of its hollow inside. It\u2019s called the \u201ctsujiura senbei,\u201d or \u201cfortune cracker,\u201d according to Jennifer 8. Lee, author of The Fortune Cookie Chronicles: Adventures in the World of Chinese Food, which recounts the history of the cookie. The Japanese cracker, Lee wrote, was larger and darker, made with sesame and miso instead of the vanilla and butter used to flavor fortune cookies found in modern Chinese restaurants in America. Lee cited Japanese researcher Yasuko Nakamachi, who said she found these cookies at a generations-old family bakery near a popular Shinto shrine just outside of Kyoto in the late 1990s. Nakamachi also uncovered storybooks from 1878 with illustrations of an apprentice who worked in a senbei store making the tsujiura senbei, along with other kinds of crackers. Lee says the fortune cookie likely arrived in the United States along with Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii and California between the 1880s and early 1900s, after the Chinese Exclusion Act\u2019s expulsion of Chinese workers left a demand for cheap labor. Japanese bakers set up shop in places such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, making miso and sesame-flavored \u201cfortune cookie-ish\u201d crackers, among other treats. One of the most oft-repeated origin stories of the American fortune cookie cites the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park as the first known U.S. restaurant to serve the treat. The Tea Garden sourced their cookies from a local bakery called Benkyodo, which claims to have pioneered the vanilla and butter flavoring and to have invented a machine sometime around 1911 to mass-produce the cookies. But, says Lee, several other sources have also claimed to invent the cookie around the same time, including three Los Angeles-based immigrant-run businesses: Fugetsu-Do confectionary in the city\u2019s Little Tokyo, Japanese snack manufacturer Umeya and the Hong Kong Noodle Company. READ MORE: History of San Francisco's Chinatown WATCH: How Japanese Americans Were Forced Into Concentration Camps During WWII How did fortune cookies migrate from Japanese bakeries to Chinese restaurants? American food preferences likely played a part. Japanese emigres to the U.S. around the turn of the 20th century couldn\u2019t open Japanese restaurants, says Lee, because Americans didn\u2019t want to eat raw fish. \u201cSo in many cases, they actually opened Chinese restaurants because they were kind of going through a big renaissance with chop suey, chow mein, egg foo young.\u201d And Americans' expectation for dessert at the end of meals, says Lee, may explain why many of these restaurants began to offer fortune cookies with the check. But the fortune cookie, once produced by Japanese Americans, eventually wound up in the hands of Chinese American manufacturers during World War II. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941 and President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans through his Executive Order 9066, Japanese American businesses began to close, including the bakeries that once made fortune cookies. That gave Chinese American entrepreneurs an opening to produce and sell them. More than 100 years later, fortune cookies remain a massive business. New York-based Wonton Food, the largest fortune-cookie producer, manufactures more than 4 million of them daily, with an estimated 3 billion cookies produced annually, wrote Lee.

Despite having historic roots in Japan and growing into a uniquely American business success story, the cookies became an easy shorthand for all things Chinese\u2014along with other reductive and sometimes disparaging pop-culture stereotypes like squinty eyes, heavy accents and being good at math.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Origins of Fortune Cookies: From Japan to California via China\n\nevidence: A fortune cookie is a crisp and sugary cookie wafer made from flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil with a piece of paper inside, a \"fortune\", an aphorism, or a vague prophecy. The message inside may also include a Chinese phrase with translation and/or a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers. Fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries, but they are not Chinese in origin. The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, though various immigrant groups in California claim to have popularized them in the early 20th century. They most likely originated from cookies made by Japanese immigrants to the United States in the late 19th or early 20th century. The Japanese version did not have the Chinese lucky numbers and were eaten with tea. Globally, the cookies are generally called by the English term fortune cookies, being American in origin. There is no single accepted Chinese name for the cookies, with a large variety of translations being used to describe them in the Chinese language, all of which being more-or-less literal translations of the English \"fortune cookie\". Examples include: \u5e78\u8fd0\u7c64\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n qi\u0101n b\u01d0ng \"good luck lot cookie\", \u7c64\u8bed\u997c qi\u0101n y\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"fortune words cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n b\u01d0ng \"good luck cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u7c64\u8bed\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n qi\u0101n y\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"lucky fortune words cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u751c\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n ti\u00e1n b\u01d0ng \"good luck sweet cookie\", \u5e78\u798f\u997c\u5e72 x\u00ecngf\u00fa b\u01d0ngg\u0101n \"good luck biscuit\", or \u5360\u535c\u997c zh\u0101nb\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"divining cookie\". As far back as the 19th century, a cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie was made in Kyoto, Japan, and there is a Japanese temple tradition of random fortunes, called omikuji. The Japanese version of the cookie differs in several ways: they are a little bit larger; are made of darker dough; and their batter contains sesame and miso rather than vanilla and butter. They contain a fortune; however, the small slip of paper was wedged into the bend of the cookie rather than placed inside the hollow portion. This kind of cookie is called tsujiura senbei (\u8fbb\u5360\u714e\u9905) and is still sold in some regions of Japan, especially in Kanazawa, Ishikawa. It is also sold in the neighborhood of Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine in Kyoto. Makoto Hagiwara of Golden Gate Park's Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco is reported to have been the first person in the U.S. to have served the modern version of the cookie when he did so at the tea garden in the 1890s or early 1900s. The fortune cookies were made by a San Francisco bakery, Benkyodo. David Jung, founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company in Los Angeles, has made a competing claim that he invented the cookie in 1918. San Francisco's Court of Historical Review attempted to settle the dispute in 1983. During the proceedings, a fortune cookie was introduced as a piece of evidence with a message reading, \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. Not Very Smart Cookie\". A federal judge of the Court of Historical Review, from San Francisco themselves, determined that the cookie originated with Hagiwara and the court ruled in favor of San Francisco. Subsequently, the city of Los Angeles condemned the decision. Seiichi Kito, the founder of Fugetsu-do of Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, also claims to have invented the cookie. Kito claims to have gotten the idea of putting a message in a cookie from Omikuji (fortune slip) which are sold at temples and shrines in Japan. According to his story, he sold his cookies to Chinese restaurants where they were greeted with much enthusiasm in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas, before spreading. Up to around World War II, fortune cookies were known as \"fortune tea cakes\"\u2014likely reflecting their origins in Japanese tea cakes. Fortune cookies moved from being a confection dominated by Japanese-Americans to one dominated by Chinese-Americans sometime around World War II. One theory for why this occurred is because of the Japanese American internment during World War II, which forcibly put over 100,000 Japanese-Americans in internment camps, including those who had produced fortune cookies. This gave an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers. Fortune cookies before the early 20th century were\n\nquestion: What was the early cookie made with?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "sesame and miso", "usage": 1089}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The fortune cookie industry changed dramatically after the fortune cookie machine was invented by Edward Louie in the late 1960s. The machine allowed for mass production of fortune cookies which subsequently allowed the cookies to drop in price to become the novelty and courtesy dessert many Americans are familiar with after their meals at most Chinese restaurants today. There are approximately 3 billion fortune cookies made each year globally, the majority of them consumed in the US. The largest manufacturer of the cookies is Wonton Food, Inc., headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. They make over 4.5 million fortune cookies per day. Other large manufacturers are Baily International in the Midwest and Peking Noodle in Los Angeles. There are other smaller, local manufacturers including Tsue Chong Co. in Seattle, Keefer Court Food in Minneapolis, Sunrise Fortune Cookie in Philadelphia, and Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory in San Francisco. Many smaller companies will also sell custom fortunes. Manufacturing processes vary, but they generally follow the same procedure. The ingredients (typically made with a base of flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil) are mixed in a large tank and squirted onto fast moving trays. These function like a conveyor belt and are heated to cook the dough. Cookies are compressed with round hot plates to shape and cook them. The cookies bake for approximately one minute and are reshaped. They can be mechanically shaped or folded by hand. When automated, a machine folds the cookie into the correct orientation with the fortune inside. Cooled and hardened cookies are sealed in plastic wrappers, which are inspected before being shipped. Today, most cookies are produced in the United States with the biggest factory located in Brooklyn. The message inside may include a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers; since relatively few distinct messages are printed, in the recorded case where winning numbers happened to be printed, the lottery had an unexpectedly high number of winners sharing a prize. Authorities briefly investigated Wonton Food in 2005, after 110 Powerball lottery players won about $19 million after using the \"lucky numbers\" on the back of fortunes. Fortune cookies are sometimes used for special marketing promotions. For example, the film Kung Fu Panda 3 was promoted by putting quotations from the protagonist of the film on fortune cookie slips. In 1989, fortune cookies were reportedly imported into Hong Kong and sold as \"genuine American fortune cookies\". Wonton Food attempted to expand its fortune cookie business into China in 1992, but gave up after fortune cookies were considered \"too American\". Cookies from different manufacturers have different ingredients and nutritional content. One cookie typically contains around 80 to 130 kilojoules (20 to 30 kilocalories) of food energy and 5\u20137 g of total carbohydrates. A cookie may have sugar varying from 0\u20133 g, between 2\u20138 mg of sodium, and may have significant (compared to their size) amounts of iron or protein. The small size means they have little overall nutritional value. Fortune cookies, while largely an American item, have been served in Chinese restaurants in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates as well as other countries. In Peru, they are served in the chifas, Chinese-Peruvian fusion food restaurants. There are also multi-cultural versions of the fortune cookie. For instance, the Mexican version of the fortune cookie, called the \"Lucky Taco\", is a red taco-shaped cookie with a fortune inside. The same company that makes the Lucky Taco also makes a \"Lucky Cannoli\", inspired by Italian cannolis.\n\nquestion: What was the early cookie made with?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil", "usage": 848}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

These small, crispy cookies are often served at the end of a meal and contain a slip of paper with a \u201cfortune\u201d inside. But there\u2019s more to them than meets the eye. From their surprising origin to the unique recipe, fortune cookies have a rich and fascinating history worth exploring. Fortune cookies are a staple of Chinese American cuisine, but it\u2019s believed that they actually originated in Japan. A Japanese cracker called tsujiura senbei can be traced back to 19th-century Kyoto. This cracker was made with sesame and miso, and contained a small paper fortune tucked into its folds. These crackers arrived in the U.S. with the Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii and California after the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, which created a demand for cheap labor to replace the Chinese immigrants who were forced out. A lot of the Japanese immigrants who moved to the U.S. settled in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The fortune cookie recipe from Kyoto came with them, and the treats started to pop up in bakeries in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the early 1900s. The Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park is often credited as the first place in the country to sell the modern-day fortune cookie. The food\u2019s exact origins are still a subject of debate, with multiple sources claiming to have invented the cookie around the same time, including three businesses in Los Angeles: the Fugetsu-Do confectionary shop, Japanese snack manufacturer Umeya, and the Hong Kong Noodle Company. Fortune cookies have always had a relatively simple recipe. While the original Japanese crackers were savory and contained sesame oil and miso, most cookies you\u2019ll find today are made with sugar, flour, vegetable shortening, water, vanilla, and food coloring. After the batter has been mixed, it\u2019s used to form flat, thin circles on a hot baking tray. The cookies only need to bake for a few minutes before they\u2019re fully cooked and ready to be shaped. After baking, the fortune cookies are removed from the oven and immediately folded into the traditional curved shape while they\u2019re still hot and pliable; this is also when paper fortunes are slipped inside. The process must be completed quickly, as it doesn\u2019t take long for the desserts to harden. The folded cookies are then cooled before being packaged and shipped to restaurants and retailers. Today, most fortune cookies are made by machine, but some artisanal bakers still whip them up by hand. There are also different variations in the recipe: Though some fortune cookies come in different colors and flavors, they\u2019ll all typically have a subtle hint of vanilla. It\u2019s difficult to estimate the exact number of fortune cookies made annually, as they\u2019re produced by many different manufacturers and small-scale bakers. However, it\u2019s safe to say that fortune cookies are a popular treat. Some estimates claim that around 3 billion fortune cookies are produced every year\u2014according to the Museum of Food and Drink, one Brooklyn-based factory alone makes 4.5 million each day. Though the U.S. leads the world in fortune cookie production and consumption, the crunchy confections are served in Chinese restaurants elsewhere in the world as well. Wonton Food Inc., based in Brooklyn, is the largest manufacturer of fortune cookies in the world. The company was founded in 1973 by Ching Sun Wong, who immigrated from China to the U.S. in the 1960s. He started the company in a store\u2019s basement. Now, Wonton Food Inc.\u2019s various plants produce a wide variety of the treats, including the traditional vanilla ones as well as flavored cookies like chocolate and citrus. Wonton Food Inc. has about 15,000 fortunes in a database it uses for all its cookies. Donald Lau, former vice president and chief financial officer Wonton Food, wrote most of those fortunes as part of his job when he first started with the company. He would find inspiration throughout the day in everything from the newspaper to subway signs. Lau eventually stopped writing new fortunes after he developed writer\u2019s block. Yang\u2019s Fortunes, Inc., a fortune cookie company based in San Francisco, has a database of about 5000 fortunes it uses in their cookies. After Lau decided to stop writing fortunes regularly, Wonton Food Inc. began hiring freelance writers every couple of years to create new fortunes. Other companies that produce fortune cookies also hire writers to generate new ideas. These gigs aren\u2019t advertised regularly\u2014so keep an eye out if you\u2019d like to add this job to your portfolio. Fortune cookie writers are typically hired as freelancers and don\u2019t get paid a lot, but it would be pretty fun to come across one of your own fortunes one day. \u00a9 2023 Minute Media\n\nquestion: What was the early cookie made with?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "A Japanese cracker called tsujiura senbei made with sesame and miso.", "usage": 1080}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

We indulged in the hot and sour soup and plates of steak sauteed with scallions and red onion and dark chicken meat marinated in garlicky soy sauce and served with a medley of nuts. And when all that was left on the white stoneware serving plates was a stray cashew or two, the waiter kindly offered us a dessert menu. Tempted, though having had my fill, I was quite content to settle for the dessert that customarily comes with the check. The fortune cookie\u2014that crunchy confection whose unobtrusive vanilla flavor is always a welcome complement to a heavy, savory meal. It's also the only time I appreciate my food talking back to me. My little strip of paper offered the chipper observation: \"You are well liked and valued by those around you.\" Who am I to argue with what a cookie tells me? Argument has, however, arisen when it comes to determining this cookie's actual national origin. It's a quintessential element of the Chinese food experience here in America, yet both Chinese and Japanese immigrant populations in this country have claimed the confection as theirs. The issue became so contentious that it fueled a 1983 court battle wherein the judge gave a split decision ruling that the modern fortune cookie was born in pre-World War I San Fransisco; however, he declined to decide which nationality had claim to the treats. The fortune cookie and its murky history is a recurring element in Jennifer 8. Lee's The Fortune Cookie Chronicles, an in-depth exploration of Chinese food in the Western world wherein she traces the beginnings of Chinese dining hallmarks such as home delivery and General Tso's Chicken in addition to exploring darker subjects such as how the Chinese restaurant industry dovetails with the human trafficking industry. But divining whence fortune cookies came required a lot of detective work that ultimately brought her to Yasuko Nakamatchi, a Japanese researcher who was able to cleave through decades of folklore and hearsay-based creation stories. Fortune cookies are most likely of Japanese origin. In the course of her detective work, Nakamatchi came upon a handful of family-owned bakeries near a Shinto shrine in Kyoto who continued the local tradition of making tsujiura senbei (\"fortune crackers\"). Flavored with sesame and miso, the cookies are larger and browner than their American cousins, and the little paper fortunes are found on the outside, held in the cookie's little \"arms.\" The clincher was an 1878 Japanese block print of a man preparing senbei using the same hand-operated cookie grills still used in the Kyoto bakeries. (Of course, at least for the American market, the manufacturing process is automated.) Dessert was never a strong point in Chinese cooking. \"Traditional Chinese desserts, as any Chinese-American child will tell you, are pretty bad,\" Lee writes in her book. \"There is a reason Chinese cuisine has a worldwide reputation for wontons, and not for pastries.\" So how did the Chinese inherit Japan's fortune cookies in the United States? During World War II, Chinese food spiked in popularity and, at least on the West Coast, dinners were commonly accompanied by fortune cookies; however, when Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps, their bakeries that produced the cookies were shuttered. Chinese entrepreneurs stepped in to fill the void and by the end of the war they were indelibly associated with fortune cookies, whose popularity had spread nationwide. So, if you're ushering in the year of the rabbit tomorrow, there are more traditional, definitively Chinese foodstuffs you can include as a part of your celebration. Nevertheless, I think there's something to be said for the sheer fun of cracking into fortune cookies with a group of friends and each person reading aloud the random pearl of wisdom they received\u2014perhaps adding a line of innuendo for a bit of innocent fun.

Let's get the most pressing point out of the way first \u2014 the historical roots of fortune cookies are not Chinese at all. Instead, research points to Japan as the source of what would become fortune cookies as they are known today. According to researcher Yasuko Nakamachi \u2014 who was interviewed by Jennifer 8. Lee, author of The Fortune CookieChronicles \u2013 fortune cookies can trace their origins to bakeries outside of Kyoto, Japan. Nakamachi's proof lies in family bakeries that surround Kyoto and the fact that they made fortune cookie-shaped crackers. Further, there is visual evidence (an image from the 1870s) that shows a baker making them in his bakery. Nakamachi first saw fortune cookies while in a Chinese restaurant in New York City, but after seeing someone making them at a bakery in Japan \u2014 complete with a piece of paper tucked inside \u2014 it set her off on a quest to find the fortune cookie's true origins. The main differences between Japanese and American fortune cookies, she found, were in the size, the flavoring, and the position of the fortune. These Japanese cookies were bigger, used sesame and miso (not vanilla and butter), and had the fortunes pinched in the mouth (not folded inside).

On this day, mooncakes were distributed widely. The cakes, which were made with a lotus nut paste, were avoided by the Mongol overlords because they didn't like the taste. The Chinese used this to their advantage, hiding instructions for rebellion inside the mooncakes and sending priests inside the occupied city's walls to distribute them. Once the instructions were distributed, the rebels were able to surprise the Mongols and overthrow them. This well-thought out plan and hard-fought victory led to the establishment of the storied Ming Dynasty, which ruled from 1368 all the way until 1644 C.E., when the Qing Dynasty took over following the last Ming Emperor Ch\u00f3ngzh\u0113n's suicide (via History).

While the cookie's historic roots can be traced to Japan, and the idea of the fortune inside a cookie can be traced even further back to 1300s China, the fortune cookie known today is believed to have been invented in 1900s California. Japanese immigration to the United States was a slow and steady process, with communities slowly popping up in various places (such as Japan Town in San Francisco) along the West Coast. As the 1900s began, more and more Japanese people started moving stateside, taking jobs first on farms or other places of hard labor. Some eventually were able to open their own businesses, and more, leading to even more population growth. It is within this context that fortune cookies were invented. There are two sites that claim ownership over the founding city of the fortune cookie. On one hand, you have San Francisco, and on the other, you have Los Angeles (via American Heritage). Both cities had growing (and engaged) Japanese populations in the early 1900s, with plenty of places \u2014 bakeries, for example \u2014 where the cookies may have originated.

In an effort to put the Los Angeles\u2013San Francisco rivalry to rest and state for the record who actually invented the fortune cookie, the Court of Historical Review \u2013 a San Francisco-based organization \u2014 held a trial in 1983.

Fortune cookies as a staple in American Chinese restaurants really took hold in and around World War II. This transition from Japanese-American to Chinese-American prominence, though, is not because of a happy, seamless, peaceful shift. During World War II, Japanese-Americans were put in internment camps in the United States (this was a response by President Franklin Roosevelt and the U.S. government to the attack on Pearl Harbor). Without Japanese-Americans producing fortune cookies, it was during this time that enterprising Chinese businessmen decided to start making cookies of their own and selling them to Chinese restaurants.

From the time of their invention in the early 1900s through the middle of the century, fortune cookies were made by hand. Once mixed, fortune cookie dough would be poured onto a tray, heated, and shaped as the fortunes were put inside. While it only takes about a minute to cook fortune cookies, this time really adds up when you're doing the entire process by hand. This process was kept up until one enterprising man by the name of Edward Louie. Louie, who opened San Francisco's Lotus Fortune Cookie Company in 1946, decided he needed to find a way to save his family the trouble of individually wrapping hundreds if not thousands of fortunes cookies every day. He set to work and in the 1960s invented a machine that automated the process by inserting the fortune cookie and folding it together. This machine allowed Lotus to create up to 90,000 fortune cookies per day, further boosting the ability to find fortune cookies far and wide.

Okay, so considering your fortune may sometimes read \"you will find the love of your life\" or some other such platitude, it might be hard to believe that the numbers contained on fortunes are lucky, but research says that they actually might be. In 2017, statistics website FiveThirtyEight bought 1,035 Panda-brand cookies in order to analyze the lucky numbers held within. There were 676 unique fortunes in the lot and 556 combinations of lucky numbers. Then, they analyzed the Powerball numbers for every drawing between Nov. 1, 1997 and May 27, 2017. The results were surprising. If a person bought a ticket every day during that time, they would've spent $4.2 million. Then, if they used every possible combination, they would've netted a grand total of around $4.4 million dollars. If they had used random numbers in that time, they would've only won $1.7 million (while still spending $4.2 million). In fact, there was even a brief investigation into Wonton Food when, on March 30, 2005, over 100 people from 29 states got five of six numbers right, netting the group over $19 million dollars total.

It\u2019s customary in many restaurants for diners to receive a small treat with their check: mints, hard candy and sometimes even chocolate. But at many Chinese restaurants around the United States, patrons get something a little different: a Pac-Man-shaped, vanilla-flavored cookie containing a finger-sized slip of paper printed with a pithy fortune or aphorism. While many Americans associate these fortune cookies with Chinese restaurants\u2014and by extension, Chinese culture\u2014they are actually more readily traceable to 19th-century Japan and 20th-century America. As far back as the 1870s, some confectionary shops near Kyoto, Japan carried a cracker with the same folded shape and a fortune tucked into the bend, instead of its hollow inside. It\u2019s called the \u201ctsujiura senbei,\u201d or \u201cfortune cracker,\u201d according to Jennifer 8. Lee, author of The Fortune Cookie Chronicles: Adventures in the World of Chinese Food, which recounts the history of the cookie. The Japanese cracker, Lee wrote, was larger and darker, made with sesame and miso instead of the vanilla and butter used to flavor fortune cookies found in modern Chinese restaurants in America. Lee cited Japanese researcher Yasuko Nakamachi, who said she found these cookies at a generations-old family bakery near a popular Shinto shrine just outside of Kyoto in the late 1990s. Nakamachi also uncovered storybooks from 1878 with illustrations of an apprentice who worked in a senbei store making the tsujiura senbei, along with other kinds of crackers. Lee says the fortune cookie likely arrived in the United States along with Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii and California between the 1880s and early 1900s, after the Chinese Exclusion Act\u2019s expulsion of Chinese workers left a demand for cheap labor. Japanese bakers set up shop in places such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, making miso and sesame-flavored \u201cfortune cookie-ish\u201d crackers, among other treats. One of the most oft-repeated origin stories of the American fortune cookie cites the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park as the first known U.S. restaurant to serve the treat. The Tea Garden sourced their cookies from a local bakery called Benkyodo, which claims to have pioneered the vanilla and butter flavoring and to have invented a machine sometime around 1911 to mass-produce the cookies. But, says Lee, several other sources have also claimed to invent the cookie around the same time, including three Los Angeles-based immigrant-run businesses: Fugetsu-Do confectionary in the city\u2019s Little Tokyo, Japanese snack manufacturer Umeya and the Hong Kong Noodle Company. READ MORE: History of San Francisco's Chinatown WATCH: How Japanese Americans Were Forced Into Concentration Camps During WWII How did fortune cookies migrate from Japanese bakeries to Chinese restaurants? American food preferences likely played a part. Japanese emigres to the U.S. around the turn of the 20th century couldn\u2019t open Japanese restaurants, says Lee, because Americans didn\u2019t want to eat raw fish. \u201cSo in many cases, they actually opened Chinese restaurants because they were kind of going through a big renaissance with chop suey, chow mein, egg foo young.\u201d And Americans' expectation for dessert at the end of meals, says Lee, may explain why many of these restaurants began to offer fortune cookies with the check. But the fortune cookie, once produced by Japanese Americans, eventually wound up in the hands of Chinese American manufacturers during World War II. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941 and President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans through his Executive Order 9066, Japanese American businesses began to close, including the bakeries that once made fortune cookies. That gave Chinese American entrepreneurs an opening to produce and sell them. More than 100 years later, fortune cookies remain a massive business. New York-based Wonton Food, the largest fortune-cookie producer, manufactures more than 4 million of them daily, with an estimated 3 billion cookies produced annually, wrote Lee.

Despite having historic roots in Japan and growing into a uniquely American business success story, the cookies became an easy shorthand for all things Chinese\u2014along with other reductive and sometimes disparaging pop-culture stereotypes like squinty eyes, heavy accents and being good at math.

The message inside may also include a Chinese phrase with translation and/or a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers. Fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries, but they are not Chinese in origin. The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, though various immigrant groups in California claim to have popularized them in the early 20th century. They most likely originated from cookies made by Japanese immigrants to the United States in the late 19th or early 20th century. The Japanese version did not have the Chinese lucky numbers and were eaten with tea. Globally, the cookies are generally called by the English term fortune cookies, being American in origin. There is no single accepted Chinese name for the cookies, with a large variety of translations being used to describe them in the Chinese language, all of which being more-or-less literal translations of the English \"fortune cookie\". Examples include: \u5e78\u8fd0\u7c64\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n qi\u0101n b\u01d0ng \"good luck lot cookie\", \u7c64\u8bed\u997c qi\u0101n y\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"fortune words cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n b\u01d0ng \"good luck cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u7c64\u8bed\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n qi\u0101n y\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"lucky fortune words cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u751c\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n ti\u00e1n b\u01d0ng \"good luck sweet cookie\", \u5e78\u798f\u997c\u5e72 x\u00ecngf\u00fa b\u01d0ngg\u0101n \"good luck biscuit\", or \u5360\u535c\u997c zh\u0101nb\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"divining cookie\". As far back as the 19th century, a cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie was made in Kyoto, Japan, and there is a Japanese temple tradition of random fortunes, called omikuji. The Japanese version of the cookie differs in several ways: they are a little bit larger; are made of darker dough; and their batter contains sesame and miso rather than vanilla and butter. They contain a fortune; however, the small slip of paper was wedged into the bend of the cookie rather than placed inside the hollow portion. This kind of cookie is called tsujiura senbei (\u8fbb\u5360\u714e\u9905) and is still sold in some regions of Japan, especially in Kanazawa, Ishikawa. It is also sold in the neighborhood of Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine in Kyoto. Makoto Hagiwara of Golden Gate Park's Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco is reported to have been the first person in the U.S. to have served the modern version of the cookie when he did so at the tea garden in the 1890s or early 1900s. The fortune cookies were made by a San Francisco bakery, Benkyodo. David Jung, founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company in Los Angeles, has made a competing claim that he invented the cookie in 1918. San Francisco's Court of Historical Review attempted to settle the dispute in 1983. During the proceedings, a fortune cookie was introduced as a piece of evidence with a message reading, \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. Not Very Smart Cookie\". A federal judge of the Court of Historical Review, from San Francisco themselves, determined that the cookie originated with Hagiwara and the court ruled in favor of San Francisco. Subsequently, the city of Los Angeles condemned the decision. Seiichi Kito, the founder of Fugetsu-do of Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, also claims to have invented the cookie. Kito claims to have gotten the idea of putting a message in a cookie from Omikuji (fortune slip) which are sold at temples and shrines in Japan. According to his story, he sold his cookies to Chinese restaurants where they were greeted with much enthusiasm in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas, before spreading. Up to around World War II, fortune cookies were known as \"fortune tea cakes\"\u2014likely reflecting their origins in Japanese tea cakes. Fortune cookies moved from being a confection dominated by Japanese-Americans to one dominated by Chinese-Americans sometime around World War II. One theory for why this occurred is because of the Japanese American internment during World War II, which forcibly put over 100,000 Japanese-Americans in internment camps, including those who had produced fortune cookies. This gave an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers. Fortune cookies before the early 20th century were\n\nquestion: Where are fortune cookies believed to have originated?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Japan", "usage": 1086}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The fortune cookie industry changed dramatically after the fortune cookie machine was invented by Edward Louie in the late 1960s. The machine allowed for mass production of fortune cookies which subsequently allowed the cookies to drop in price to become the novelty and courtesy dessert many Americans are familiar with after their meals at most Chinese restaurants today. There are approximately 3 billion fortune cookies made each year globally, the majority of them consumed in the US. The largest manufacturer of the cookies is Wonton Food, Inc., headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. They make over 4.5 million fortune cookies per day. Other large manufacturers are Baily International in the Midwest and Peking Noodle in Los Angeles. There are other smaller, local manufacturers including Tsue Chong Co. in Seattle, Keefer Court Food in Minneapolis, Sunrise Fortune Cookie in Philadelphia, and Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory in San Francisco. Many smaller companies will also sell custom fortunes. Manufacturing processes vary, but they generally follow the same procedure. The ingredients (typically made with a base of flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil) are mixed in a large tank and squirted onto fast moving trays. These function like a conveyor belt and are heated to cook the dough. Cookies are compressed with round hot plates to shape and cook them. The cookies bake for approximately one minute and are reshaped. They can be mechanically shaped or folded by hand. When automated, a machine folds the cookie into the correct orientation with the fortune inside. Cooled and hardened cookies are sealed in plastic wrappers, which are inspected before being shipped. Today, most cookies are produced in the United States with the biggest factory located in Brooklyn. The message inside may include a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers; since relatively few distinct messages are printed, in the recorded case where winning numbers happened to be printed, the lottery had an unexpectedly high number of winners sharing a prize. Authorities briefly investigated Wonton Food in 2005, after 110 Powerball lottery players won about $19 million after using the \"lucky numbers\" on the back of fortunes. Fortune cookies are sometimes used for special marketing promotions. For example, the film Kung Fu Panda 3 was promoted by putting quotations from the protagonist of the film on fortune cookie slips. In 1989, fortune cookies were reportedly imported into Hong Kong and sold as \"genuine American fortune cookies\". Wonton Food attempted to expand its fortune cookie business into China in 1992, but gave up after fortune cookies were considered \"too American\". Cookies from different manufacturers have different ingredients and nutritional content. One cookie typically contains around 80 to 130 kilojoules (20 to 30 kilocalories) of food energy and 5\u20137 g of total carbohydrates. A cookie may have sugar varying from 0\u20133 g, between 2\u20138 mg of sodium, and may have significant (compared to their size) amounts of iron or protein. The small size means they have little overall nutritional value. Fortune cookies, while largely an American item, have been served in Chinese restaurants in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates as well as other countries. In Peru, they are served in the chifas, Chinese-Peruvian fusion food restaurants. There are also multi-cultural versions of the fortune cookie. For instance, the Mexican version of the fortune cookie, called the \"Lucky Taco\", is a red taco-shaped cookie with a fortune inside. The same company that makes the Lucky Taco also makes a \"Lucky Cannoli\", inspired by Italian cannolis.\n\nquestion: Where are fortune cookies believed to have originated?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "China.", "usage": 840}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

These small, crispy cookies are often served at the end of a meal and contain a slip of paper with a \u201cfortune\u201d inside. But there\u2019s more to them than meets the eye. From their surprising origin to the unique recipe, fortune cookies have a rich and fascinating history worth exploring. Fortune cookies are a staple of Chinese American cuisine, but it\u2019s believed that they actually originated in Japan. A Japanese cracker called tsujiura senbei can be traced back to 19th-century Kyoto. This cracker was made with sesame and miso, and contained a small paper fortune tucked into its folds. These crackers arrived in the U.S. with the Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii and California after the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, which created a demand for cheap labor to replace the Chinese immigrants who were forced out. A lot of the Japanese immigrants who moved to the U.S. settled in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The fortune cookie recipe from Kyoto came with them, and the treats started to pop up in bakeries in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the early 1900s. The Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park is often credited as the first place in the country to sell the modern-day fortune cookie. The food\u2019s exact origins are still a subject of debate, with multiple sources claiming to have invented the cookie around the same time, including three businesses in Los Angeles: the Fugetsu-Do confectionary shop, Japanese snack manufacturer Umeya, and the Hong Kong Noodle Company. Fortune cookies have always had a relatively simple recipe. While the original Japanese crackers were savory and contained sesame oil and miso, most cookies you\u2019ll find today are made with sugar, flour, vegetable shortening, water, vanilla, and food coloring. After the batter has been mixed, it\u2019s used to form flat, thin circles on a hot baking tray. The cookies only need to bake for a few minutes before they\u2019re fully cooked and ready to be shaped. After baking, the fortune cookies are removed from the oven and immediately folded into the traditional curved shape while they\u2019re still hot and pliable; this is also when paper fortunes are slipped inside. The process must be completed quickly, as it doesn\u2019t take long for the desserts to harden. The folded cookies are then cooled before being packaged and shipped to restaurants and retailers. Today, most fortune cookies are made by machine, but some artisanal bakers still whip them up by hand. There are also different variations in the recipe: Though some fortune cookies come in different colors and flavors, they\u2019ll all typically have a subtle hint of vanilla. It\u2019s difficult to estimate the exact number of fortune cookies made annually, as they\u2019re produced by many different manufacturers and small-scale bakers. However, it\u2019s safe to say that fortune cookies are a popular treat. Some estimates claim that around 3 billion fortune cookies are produced every year\u2014according to the Museum of Food and Drink, one Brooklyn-based factory alone makes 4.5 million each day. Though the U.S. leads the world in fortune cookie production and consumption, the crunchy confections are served in Chinese restaurants elsewhere in the world as well. Wonton Food Inc., based in Brooklyn, is the largest manufacturer of fortune cookies in the world. The company was founded in 1973 by Ching Sun Wong, who immigrated from China to the U.S. in the 1960s. He started the company in a store\u2019s basement. Now, Wonton Food Inc.\u2019s various plants produce a wide variety of the treats, including the traditional vanilla ones as well as flavored cookies like chocolate and citrus. Wonton Food Inc. has about 15,000 fortunes in a database it uses for all its cookies. Donald Lau, former vice president and chief financial officer Wonton Food, wrote most of those fortunes as part of his job when he first started with the company. He would find inspiration throughout the day in everything from the newspaper to subway signs. Lau eventually stopped writing new fortunes after he developed writer\u2019s block. Yang\u2019s Fortunes, Inc., a fortune cookie company based in San Francisco, has a database of about 5000 fortunes it uses in their cookies. After Lau decided to stop writing fortunes regularly, Wonton Food Inc. began hiring freelance writers every couple of years to create new fortunes. Other companies that produce fortune cookies also hire writers to generate new ideas. These gigs aren\u2019t advertised regularly\u2014so keep an eye out if you\u2019d like to add this job to your portfolio. Fortune cookie writers are typically hired as freelancers and don\u2019t get paid a lot, but it would be pretty fun to come across one of your own fortunes one day. \u00a9 2023 Minute Media\n\nquestion: Where are fortune cookies believed to have originated?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Japan", "usage": 1064}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

We indulged in the hot and sour soup and plates of steak sauteed with scallions and red onion and dark chicken meat marinated in garlicky soy sauce and served with a medley of nuts. And when all that was left on the white stoneware serving plates was a stray cashew or two, the waiter kindly offered us a dessert menu. Tempted, though having had my fill, I was quite content to settle for the dessert that customarily comes with the check. The fortune cookie\u2014that crunchy confection whose unobtrusive vanilla flavor is always a welcome complement to a heavy, savory meal. It's also the only time I appreciate my food talking back to me. My little strip of paper offered the chipper observation: \"You are well liked and valued by those around you.\" Who am I to argue with what a cookie tells me? Argument has, however, arisen when it comes to determining this cookie's actual national origin. It's a quintessential element of the Chinese food experience here in America, yet both Chinese and Japanese immigrant populations in this country have claimed the confection as theirs. The issue became so contentious that it fueled a 1983 court battle wherein the judge gave a split decision ruling that the modern fortune cookie was born in pre-World War I San Fransisco; however, he declined to decide which nationality had claim to the treats. The fortune cookie and its murky history is a recurring element in Jennifer 8. Lee's The Fortune Cookie Chronicles, an in-depth exploration of Chinese food in the Western world wherein she traces the beginnings of Chinese dining hallmarks such as home delivery and General Tso's Chicken in addition to exploring darker subjects such as how the Chinese restaurant industry dovetails with the human trafficking industry. But divining whence fortune cookies came required a lot of detective work that ultimately brought her to Yasuko Nakamatchi, a Japanese researcher who was able to cleave through decades of folklore and hearsay-based creation stories. Fortune cookies are most likely of Japanese origin. In the course of her detective work, Nakamatchi came upon a handful of family-owned bakeries near a Shinto shrine in Kyoto who continued the local tradition of making tsujiura senbei (\"fortune crackers\"). Flavored with sesame and miso, the cookies are larger and browner than their American cousins, and the little paper fortunes are found on the outside, held in the cookie's little \"arms.\" The clincher was an 1878 Japanese block print of a man preparing senbei using the same hand-operated cookie grills still used in the Kyoto bakeries. (Of course, at least for the American market, the manufacturing process is automated.) Dessert was never a strong point in Chinese cooking. \"Traditional Chinese desserts, as any Chinese-American child will tell you, are pretty bad,\" Lee writes in her book. \"There is a reason Chinese cuisine has a worldwide reputation for wontons, and not for pastries.\" So how did the Chinese inherit Japan's fortune cookies in the United States? During World War II, Chinese food spiked in popularity and, at least on the West Coast, dinners were commonly accompanied by fortune cookies; however, when Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps, their bakeries that produced the cookies were shuttered. Chinese entrepreneurs stepped in to fill the void and by the end of the war they were indelibly associated with fortune cookies, whose popularity had spread nationwide. So, if you're ushering in the year of the rabbit tomorrow, there are more traditional, definitively Chinese foodstuffs you can include as a part of your celebration. Nevertheless, I think there's something to be said for the sheer fun of cracking into fortune cookies with a group of friends and each person reading aloud the random pearl of wisdom they received\u2014perhaps adding a line of innuendo for a bit of innocent fun.

Let's get the most pressing point out of the way first \u2014 the historical roots of fortune cookies are not Chinese at all. Instead, research points to Japan as the source of what would become fortune cookies as they are known today. According to researcher Yasuko Nakamachi \u2014 who was interviewed by Jennifer 8. Lee, author of The Fortune CookieChronicles \u2013 fortune cookies can trace their origins to bakeries outside of Kyoto, Japan. Nakamachi's proof lies in family bakeries that surround Kyoto and the fact that they made fortune cookie-shaped crackers. Further, there is visual evidence (an image from the 1870s) that shows a baker making them in his bakery. Nakamachi first saw fortune cookies while in a Chinese restaurant in New York City, but after seeing someone making them at a bakery in Japan \u2014 complete with a piece of paper tucked inside \u2014 it set her off on a quest to find the fortune cookie's true origins. The main differences between Japanese and American fortune cookies, she found, were in the size, the flavoring, and the position of the fortune. These Japanese cookies were bigger, used sesame and miso (not vanilla and butter), and had the fortunes pinched in the mouth (not folded inside).

On this day, mooncakes were distributed widely. The cakes, which were made with a lotus nut paste, were avoided by the Mongol overlords because they didn't like the taste. The Chinese used this to their advantage, hiding instructions for rebellion inside the mooncakes and sending priests inside the occupied city's walls to distribute them. Once the instructions were distributed, the rebels were able to surprise the Mongols and overthrow them. This well-thought out plan and hard-fought victory led to the establishment of the storied Ming Dynasty, which ruled from 1368 all the way until 1644 C.E., when the Qing Dynasty took over following the last Ming Emperor Ch\u00f3ngzh\u0113n's suicide (via History).

While the cookie's historic roots can be traced to Japan, and the idea of the fortune inside a cookie can be traced even further back to 1300s China, the fortune cookie known today is believed to have been invented in 1900s California. Japanese immigration to the United States was a slow and steady process, with communities slowly popping up in various places (such as Japan Town in San Francisco) along the West Coast. As the 1900s began, more and more Japanese people started moving stateside, taking jobs first on farms or other places of hard labor. Some eventually were able to open their own businesses, and more, leading to even more population growth. It is within this context that fortune cookies were invented. There are two sites that claim ownership over the founding city of the fortune cookie. On one hand, you have San Francisco, and on the other, you have Los Angeles (via American Heritage). Both cities had growing (and engaged) Japanese populations in the early 1900s, with plenty of places \u2014 bakeries, for example \u2014 where the cookies may have originated.

Like many famous foods/objects/really anything throughout history, the actual inventor of the fortune cookie is a hotly contested subject. There are two main contenders for the title of fortune cookie inventor. First, there is Makoto Hagiwara. Hagiwara was a Japanese immigrant who was (as of 1895) employed as the caretaker for San Francisco's Japanese Tea Gardens. Then, sometime between 1907 and 1909, Hagiwara began serving cookies based on Japanese senbei (toasted rice wafers) to visitors of the garden.

In an effort to put the Los Angeles\u2013San Francisco rivalry to rest and state for the record who actually invented the fortune cookie, the Court of Historical Review \u2013 a San Francisco-based organization \u2014 held a trial in 1983. Shockingly \u2014 or perhaps not, if you consider where the Court of Historical Review is based \u2013 it was decided that Makoto Hagiwara was the inventor and the city of San Francisco the home of the fortune cookie. During the trial, the man overseeing the case (a real federal judge named Daniel M. Hanlon), was allegedly given a fortune cookie that read, \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. not very smart cookie.\" It is one thing to hold a \"trial\" to decide an answer to something like the founding of a food, but no matter how you look at it, the trial was a product of the time. Participants in the trial not only donned clothing designed to look like ancient Chinese robes, but they also spoke in a pidgin English while recounting each claimant's history of the cookie. (Other evidence was issued as well, such as a set of grills that were used to create the cookies.) To this day, San Franciscans and Angelenos still don't agree on who actually invented the fortune cookie.

Fortune cookies as a staple in American Chinese restaurants really took hold in and around World War II. This transition from Japanese-American to Chinese-American prominence, though, is not because of a happy, seamless, peaceful shift. During World War II, Japanese-Americans were put in internment camps in the United States (this was a response by President Franklin Roosevelt and the U.S. government to the attack on Pearl Harbor). Without Japanese-Americans producing fortune cookies, it was during this time that enterprising Chinese businessmen decided to start making cookies of their own and selling them to Chinese restaurants. This started the proliferation of fortune cookies that has maintained a steady increase through the present day. When soldiers came home from war \u2014 and even more so as American families began to dine out in the 1950s and beyond \u2014 the wish for something sweet after dinner was great. And since Chinese cuisine did not have many sweet dessert options (compared to, say, French or Italian cuisines), restaurateurs offered up Fortune cookies, which were promptly cracked open and gobbled up.

From the time of their invention in the early 1900s through the middle of the century, fortune cookies were made by hand. Once mixed, fortune cookie dough would be poured onto a tray, heated, and shaped as the fortunes were put inside. While it only takes about a minute to cook fortune cookies, this time really adds up when you're doing the entire process by hand. This process was kept up until one enterprising man by the name of Edward Louie. Louie, who opened San Francisco's Lotus Fortune Cookie Company in 1946, decided he needed to find a way to save his family the trouble of individually wrapping hundreds if not thousands of fortunes cookies every day. He set to work and in the 1960s invented a machine that automated the process by inserting the fortune cookie and folding it together. This machine allowed Lotus to create up to 90,000 fortune cookies per day, further boosting the ability to find fortune cookies far and wide.

These, of course, are the basis for many baked goods, but if they're all you've got, you're on your way. If you are making them at home, you might be adding a few other ingredients as well. A flavoring agent, such as vanilla or almond extract, is a popular addition, as are butter and a little bit of salt.

Four things create the ritual that has not changed much since its inception a century ago. Another thing that is simple about the fortune cookie? The recipe. In its essence, fortune cookies contain four basic ingredients \u2013 flour, sugar, water, and eggs. With these, fortune cookies can be made. These, of course, are the basis for many baked goods, but if they're all you've got, you're on your way. If you are making them at home, you might be adding a few other ingredients as well. A flavoring agent, such as vanilla or almond extract, is a popular addition, as are butter and a little bit of salt. On the commercial level, though, more ingredients are added so that the cookies will not spoil on their journey to Chinese restaurants nationwide. These ingredients include anticaking agents, stabilizing agents, baking powder, and baking soda \u2014 no one wants to find a gummed-up or broken fortune cookie in the bottom of their to-go bag. Even though it produces the most fortune cookies in the world, Wonton Food \u2014 for more than 30 years \u2014 only employed one fortune writer. That man, Donald Lau, was chosen because of his command of the English language (Lau now also serves as the chief financial officer and vice president) and continued to write multiple fortunes a day for 30 years. When Lau took over writing fortunes in the 1980s, the company had only a couple hundred to choose from. Lau rewrote and refreshed the ones they had and continued to add more. Now, Wonton Food's fortune library numbers over 10,000. What started out very similar to the current fortunes evolved, and Lau began using dry wit and everyday observances to craft fortunes. These he would test on friends and coworkers and if they passed, the fortunes would likely make it into a cookie. In 2017, he retired from fortune writing and passed the duties on to Wonton Food Assistant Vice President James Wong, the nephew of the founder of Wonton Food.

Okay, so considering your fortune may sometimes read \"you will find the love of your life\" or some other such platitude, it might be hard to believe that the numbers contained on fortunes are lucky, but research says that they actually might be. In 2017, statistics website FiveThirtyEight bought 1,035 Panda-brand cookies in order to analyze the lucky numbers held within. There were 676 unique fortunes in the lot and 556 combinations of lucky numbers. Then, they analyzed the Powerball numbers for every drawing between Nov. 1, 1997 and May 27, 2017. The results were surprising. If a person bought a ticket every day during that time, they would've spent $4.2 million. Then, if they used every possible combination, they would've netted a grand total of around $4.4 million dollars. If they had used random numbers in that time, they would've only won $1.7 million (while still spending $4.2 million). In fact, there was even a brief investigation into Wonton Food when, on March 30, 2005, over 100 people from 29 states got five of six numbers right, netting the group over $19 million dollars total.

It\u2019s customary in many restaurants for diners to receive a small treat with their check: mints, hard candy and sometimes even chocolate. But at many Chinese restaurants around the United States, patrons get something a little different: a Pac-Man-shaped, vanilla-flavored cookie containing a finger-sized slip of paper printed with a pithy fortune or aphorism. While many Americans associate these fortune cookies with Chinese restaurants\u2014and by extension, Chinese culture\u2014they are actually more readily traceable to 19th-century Japan and 20th-century America. As far back as the 1870s, some confectionary shops near Kyoto, Japan carried a cracker with the same folded shape and a fortune tucked into the bend, instead of its hollow inside. It\u2019s called the \u201ctsujiura senbei,\u201d or \u201cfortune cracker,\u201d according to Jennifer 8. Lee, author of The Fortune Cookie Chronicles: Adventures in the World of Chinese Food, which recounts the history of the cookie. The Japanese cracker, Lee wrote, was larger and darker, made with sesame and miso instead of the vanilla and butter used to flavor fortune cookies found in modern Chinese restaurants in America. Lee cited Japanese researcher Yasuko Nakamachi, who said she found these cookies at a generations-old family bakery near a popular Shinto shrine just outside of Kyoto in the late 1990s. Nakamachi also uncovered storybooks from 1878 with illustrations of an apprentice who worked in a senbei store making the tsujiura senbei, along with other kinds of crackers. Lee says the fortune cookie likely arrived in the United States along with Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii and California between the 1880s and early 1900s, after the Chinese Exclusion Act\u2019s expulsion of Chinese workers left a demand for cheap labor. Japanese bakers set up shop in places such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, making miso and sesame-flavored \u201cfortune cookie-ish\u201d crackers, among other treats. One of the most oft-repeated origin stories of the American fortune cookie cites the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park as the first known U.S. restaurant to serve the treat. The Tea Garden sourced their cookies from a local bakery called Benkyodo, which claims to have pioneered the vanilla and butter flavoring and to have invented a machine sometime around 1911 to mass-produce the cookies. But, says Lee, several other sources have also claimed to invent the cookie around the same time, including three Los Angeles-based immigrant-run businesses: Fugetsu-Do confectionary in the city\u2019s Little Tokyo, Japanese snack manufacturer Umeya and the Hong Kong Noodle Company. READ MORE: History of San Francisco's Chinatown WATCH: How Japanese Americans Were Forced Into Concentration Camps During WWII How did fortune cookies migrate from Japanese bakeries to Chinese restaurants? American food preferences likely played a part. Japanese emigres to the U.S. around the turn of the 20th century couldn\u2019t open Japanese restaurants, says Lee, because Americans didn\u2019t want to eat raw fish. \u201cSo in many cases, they actually opened Chinese restaurants because they were kind of going through a big renaissance with chop suey, chow mein, egg foo young.\u201d And Americans' expectation for dessert at the end of meals, says Lee, may explain why many of these restaurants began to offer fortune cookies with the check. But the fortune cookie, once produced by Japanese Americans, eventually wound up in the hands of Chinese American manufacturers during World War II. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941 and President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans through his Executive Order 9066, Japanese American businesses began to close, including the bakeries that once made fortune cookies. That gave Chinese American entrepreneurs an opening to produce and sell them. More than 100 years later, fortune cookies remain a massive business. New York-based Wonton Food, the largest fortune-cookie producer, manufactures more than 4 million of them daily, with an estimated 3 billion cookies produced annually, wrote Lee.

Despite having historic roots in Japan and growing into a uniquely American business success story, the cookies became an easy shorthand for all things Chinese\u2014along with other reductive and sometimes disparaging pop-culture stereotypes like squinty eyes, heavy accents and being good at math.

Using things like fortune cookies and takeout boxes as shorthands for Chinese culture is misleading, says Lee, given that they\u2019re distinctly American inventions\u2014and the global reach of American culture helps to perpetuate those stereotypes around the world. But despite misconceptions about its true origins and its misuse as a symbol of Chinese heritage, the fortune cookie still carries powerful resonance throughout American culture. \u201cYou have the number of people who have been engaged through fortune cookies, you have fortune cookie little baby booties, fortune cookie jewelry,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt really speaks to Americans in a very profound way.\u201d READ MORE: The 8-Year-Old Chinese American Girl Who Helped Desegregate Schools\u2014in 1885 By: Michael Lee We strive for accuracy and fairness.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: The Origins of Fortune Cookies: From Japan to California via China\n\nevidence: A fortune cookie is a crisp and sugary cookie wafer made from flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil with a piece of paper inside, a \"fortune\", an aphorism, or a vague prophecy. The message inside may also include a Chinese phrase with translation and/or a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers. Fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries, but they are not Chinese in origin. The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, though various immigrant groups in California claim to have popularized them in the early 20th century. They most likely originated from cookies made by Japanese immigrants to the United States in the late 19th or early 20th century. The Japanese version did not have the Chinese lucky numbers and were eaten with tea. Globally, the cookies are generally called by the English term fortune cookies, being American in origin. There is no single accepted Chinese name for the cookies, with a large variety of translations being used to describe them in the Chinese language, all of which being more-or-less literal translations of the English \"fortune cookie\". Examples include: \u5e78\u8fd0\u7c64\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n qi\u0101n b\u01d0ng \"good luck lot cookie\", \u7c64\u8bed\u997c qi\u0101n y\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"fortune words cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n b\u01d0ng \"good luck cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u7c64\u8bed\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n qi\u0101n y\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"lucky fortune words cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u751c\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n ti\u00e1n b\u01d0ng \"good luck sweet cookie\", \u5e78\u798f\u997c\u5e72 x\u00ecngf\u00fa b\u01d0ngg\u0101n \"good luck biscuit\", or \u5360\u535c\u997c zh\u0101nb\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"divining cookie\". As far back as the 19th century, a cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie was made in Kyoto, Japan, and there is a Japanese temple tradition of random fortunes, called omikuji. The Japanese version of the cookie differs in several ways: they are a little bit larger; are made of darker dough; and their batter contains sesame and miso rather than vanilla and butter. They contain a fortune; however, the small slip of paper was wedged into the bend of the cookie rather than placed inside the hollow portion. This kind of cookie is called tsujiura senbei (\u8fbb\u5360\u714e\u9905) and is still sold in some regions of Japan, especially in Kanazawa, Ishikawa. It is also sold in the neighborhood of Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine in Kyoto. Makoto Hagiwara of Golden Gate Park's Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco is reported to have been the first person in the U.S. to have served the modern version of the cookie when he did so at the tea garden in the 1890s or early 1900s. The fortune cookies were made by a San Francisco bakery, Benkyodo. David Jung, founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company in Los Angeles, has made a competing claim that he invented the cookie in 1918. San Francisco's Court of Historical Review attempted to settle the dispute in 1983. During the proceedings, a fortune cookie was introduced as a piece of evidence with a message reading, \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. Not Very Smart Cookie\". A federal judge of the Court of Historical Review, from San Francisco themselves, determined that the cookie originated with Hagiwara and the court ruled in favor of San Francisco. Subsequently, the city of Los Angeles condemned the decision. Seiichi Kito, the founder of Fugetsu-do of Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, also claims to have invented the cookie. Kito claims to have gotten the idea of putting a message in a cookie from Omikuji (fortune slip) which are sold at temples and shrines in Japan. According to his story, he sold his cookies to Chinese restaurants where they were greeted with much enthusiasm in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas, before spreading. Up to around World War II, fortune cookies were known as \"fortune tea cakes\"\u2014likely reflecting their origins in Japanese tea cakes. Fortune cookies moved from being a confection dominated by Japanese-Americans to one dominated by Chinese-Americans sometime around World War II. One theory for why this occurred is because of the Japanese American internment during World War II, which forcibly put over 100,000 Japanese-Americans in internment camps, including those who had produced fortune cookies. This gave an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers. Fortune cookies before the early 20th century were\n\nquestion: What was the early cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie called?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "tsujiura senbei", "usage": 1098}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The fortune cookie industry changed dramatically after the fortune cookie machine was invented by Edward Louie in the late 1960s. The machine allowed for mass production of fortune cookies which subsequently allowed the cookies to drop in price to become the novelty and courtesy dessert many Americans are familiar with after their meals at most Chinese restaurants today. There are approximately 3 billion fortune cookies made each year globally, the majority of them consumed in the US. The largest manufacturer of the cookies is Wonton Food, Inc., headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. They make over 4.5 million fortune cookies per day. Other large manufacturers are Baily International in the Midwest and Peking Noodle in Los Angeles. There are other smaller, local manufacturers including Tsue Chong Co. in Seattle, Keefer Court Food in Minneapolis, Sunrise Fortune Cookie in Philadelphia, and Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory in San Francisco. Many smaller companies will also sell custom fortunes. Manufacturing processes vary, but they generally follow the same procedure. The ingredients (typically made with a base of flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil) are mixed in a large tank and squirted onto fast moving trays. These function like a conveyor belt and are heated to cook the dough. Cookies are compressed with round hot plates to shape and cook them. The cookies bake for approximately one minute and are reshaped. They can be mechanically shaped or folded by hand. When automated, a machine folds the cookie into the correct orientation with the fortune inside. Cooled and hardened cookies are sealed in plastic wrappers, which are inspected before being shipped. Today, most cookies are produced in the United States with the biggest factory located in Brooklyn. The message inside may include a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers; since relatively few distinct messages are printed, in the recorded case where winning numbers happened to be printed, the lottery had an unexpectedly high number of winners sharing a prize. Authorities briefly investigated Wonton Food in 2005, after 110 Powerball lottery players won about $19 million after using the \"lucky numbers\" on the back of fortunes. Fortune cookies are sometimes used for special marketing promotions. For example, the film Kung Fu Panda 3 was promoted by putting quotations from the protagonist of the film on fortune cookie slips. In 1989, fortune cookies were reportedly imported into Hong Kong and sold as \"genuine American fortune cookies\". Wonton Food attempted to expand its fortune cookie business into China in 1992, but gave up after fortune cookies were considered \"too American\". Cookies from different manufacturers have different ingredients and nutritional content. One cookie typically contains around 80 to 130 kilojoules (20 to 30 kilocalories) of food energy and 5\u20137 g of total carbohydrates. A cookie may have sugar varying from 0\u20133 g, between 2\u20138 mg of sodium, and may have significant (compared to their size) amounts of iron or protein. The small size means they have little overall nutritional value. Fortune cookies, while largely an American item, have been served in Chinese restaurants in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates as well as other countries. In Peru, they are served in the chifas, Chinese-Peruvian fusion food restaurants. There are also multi-cultural versions of the fortune cookie. For instance, the Mexican version of the fortune cookie, called the \"Lucky Taco\", is a red taco-shaped cookie with a fortune inside. The same company that makes the Lucky Taco also makes a \"Lucky Cannoli\", inspired by Italian cannolis.\n\nquestion: What was the early cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie called?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 847}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

These small, crispy cookies are often served at the end of a meal and contain a slip of paper with a \u201cfortune\u201d inside. But there\u2019s more to them than meets the eye. From their surprising origin to the unique recipe, fortune cookies have a rich and fascinating history worth exploring. Fortune cookies are a staple of Chinese American cuisine, but it\u2019s believed that they actually originated in Japan. A Japanese cracker called tsujiura senbei can be traced back to 19th-century Kyoto. This cracker was made with sesame and miso, and contained a small paper fortune tucked into its folds. These crackers arrived in the U.S. with the Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii and California after the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, which created a demand for cheap labor to replace the Chinese immigrants who were forced out. A lot of the Japanese immigrants who moved to the U.S. settled in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The fortune cookie recipe from Kyoto came with them, and the treats started to pop up in bakeries in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the early 1900s. The Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park is often credited as the first place in the country to sell the modern-day fortune cookie. The food\u2019s exact origins are still a subject of debate, with multiple sources claiming to have invented the cookie around the same time, including three businesses in Los Angeles: the Fugetsu-Do confectionary shop, Japanese snack manufacturer Umeya, and the Hong Kong Noodle Company. Fortune cookies have always had a relatively simple recipe. While the original Japanese crackers were savory and contained sesame oil and miso, most cookies you\u2019ll find today are made with sugar, flour, vegetable shortening, water, vanilla, and food coloring. After the batter has been mixed, it\u2019s used to form flat, thin circles on a hot baking tray. The cookies only need to bake for a few minutes before they\u2019re fully cooked and ready to be shaped. After baking, the fortune cookies are removed from the oven and immediately folded into the traditional curved shape while they\u2019re still hot and pliable; this is also when paper fortunes are slipped inside. The process must be completed quickly, as it doesn\u2019t take long for the desserts to harden. The folded cookies are then cooled before being packaged and shipped to restaurants and retailers. Today, most fortune cookies are made by machine, but some artisanal bakers still whip them up by hand. There are also different variations in the recipe: Though some fortune cookies come in different colors and flavors, they\u2019ll all typically have a subtle hint of vanilla. It\u2019s difficult to estimate the exact number of fortune cookies made annually, as they\u2019re produced by many different manufacturers and small-scale bakers. However, it\u2019s safe to say that fortune cookies are a popular treat. Some estimates claim that around 3 billion fortune cookies are produced every year\u2014according to the Museum of Food and Drink, one Brooklyn-based factory alone makes 4.5 million each day. Though the U.S. leads the world in fortune cookie production and consumption, the crunchy confections are served in Chinese restaurants elsewhere in the world as well. Wonton Food Inc., based in Brooklyn, is the largest manufacturer of fortune cookies in the world. The company was founded in 1973 by Ching Sun Wong, who immigrated from China to the U.S. in the 1960s. He started the company in a store\u2019s basement. Now, Wonton Food Inc.\u2019s various plants produce a wide variety of the treats, including the traditional vanilla ones as well as flavored cookies like chocolate and citrus. Wonton Food Inc. has about 15,000 fortunes in a database it uses for all its cookies. Donald Lau, former vice president and chief financial officer Wonton Food, wrote most of those fortunes as part of his job when he first started with the company. He would find inspiration throughout the day in everything from the newspaper to subway signs. Lau eventually stopped writing new fortunes after he developed writer\u2019s block. Yang\u2019s Fortunes, Inc., a fortune cookie company based in San Francisco, has a database of about 5000 fortunes it uses in their cookies. After Lau decided to stop writing fortunes regularly, Wonton Food Inc. began hiring freelance writers every couple of years to create new fortunes. Other companies that produce fortune cookies also hire writers to generate new ideas. These gigs aren\u2019t advertised regularly\u2014so keep an eye out if you\u2019d like to add this job to your portfolio. Fortune cookie writers are typically hired as freelancers and don\u2019t get paid a lot, but it would be pretty fun to come across one of your own fortunes one day. \u00a9 2023 Minute Media\n\nquestion: What was the early cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie called?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "tsujiura senbei", "usage": 1076}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

We indulged in the hot and sour soup and plates of steak sauteed with scallions and red onion and dark chicken meat marinated in garlicky soy sauce and served with a medley of nuts. And when all that was left on the white stoneware serving plates was a stray cashew or two, the waiter kindly offered us a dessert menu. Tempted, though having had my fill, I was quite content to settle for the dessert that customarily comes with the check. The fortune cookie\u2014that crunchy confection whose unobtrusive vanilla flavor is always a welcome complement to a heavy, savory meal. It's also the only time I appreciate my food talking back to me. My little strip of paper offered the chipper observation: \"You are well liked and valued by those around you.\" Who am I to argue with what a cookie tells me? Argument has, however, arisen when it comes to determining this cookie's actual national origin. It's a quintessential element of the Chinese food experience here in America, yet both Chinese and Japanese immigrant populations in this country have claimed the confection as theirs. The issue became so contentious that it fueled a 1983 court battle wherein the judge gave a split decision ruling that the modern fortune cookie was born in pre-World War I San Fransisco; however, he declined to decide which nationality had claim to the treats. The fortune cookie and its murky history is a recurring element in Jennifer 8. Lee's The Fortune Cookie Chronicles, an in-depth exploration of Chinese food in the Western world wherein she traces the beginnings of Chinese dining hallmarks such as home delivery and General Tso's Chicken in addition to exploring darker subjects such as how the Chinese restaurant industry dovetails with the human trafficking industry. But divining whence fortune cookies came required a lot of detective work that ultimately brought her to Yasuko Nakamatchi, a Japanese researcher who was able to cleave through decades of folklore and hearsay-based creation stories. Fortune cookies are most likely of Japanese origin. In the course of her detective work, Nakamatchi came upon a handful of family-owned bakeries near a Shinto shrine in Kyoto who continued the local tradition of making tsujiura senbei (\"fortune crackers\"). Flavored with sesame and miso, the cookies are larger and browner than their American cousins, and the little paper fortunes are found on the outside, held in the cookie's little \"arms.\" The clincher was an 1878 Japanese block print of a man preparing senbei using the same hand-operated cookie grills still used in the Kyoto bakeries. (Of course, at least for the American market, the manufacturing process is automated.) Dessert was never a strong point in Chinese cooking. \"Traditional Chinese desserts, as any Chinese-American child will tell you, are pretty bad,\" Lee writes in her book. \"There is a reason Chinese cuisine has a worldwide reputation for wontons, and not for pastries.\" So how did the Chinese inherit Japan's fortune cookies in the United States? During World War II, Chinese food spiked in popularity and, at least on the West Coast, dinners were commonly accompanied by fortune cookies; however, when Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps, their bakeries that produced the cookies were shuttered. Chinese entrepreneurs stepped in to fill the void and by the end of the war they were indelibly associated with fortune cookies, whose popularity had spread nationwide. So, if you're ushering in the year of the rabbit tomorrow, there are more traditional, definitively Chinese foodstuffs you can include as a part of your celebration. Nevertheless, I think there's something to be said for the sheer fun of cracking into fortune cookies with a group of friends and each person reading aloud the random pearl of wisdom they received\u2014perhaps adding a line of innuendo for a bit of innocent fun.

For almost a century now, diners across the United States have been greeted by the same thing at the end of a meal at a Chinese restaurant \u2014 a fortune cookie. These delightful little treats offer just enough sweetness crossing the palate to satiate even the most sugar-hungry diners. Before you get to the eating of the cookie though, you have to attend to the most important part (it is in the name, after all) \u2014 the fortune, accompanied by a string of lucky numbers. On the back, too, there is sometimes a Chinese language lesson. Whether you believe in the fortunes or the lucky numbers is irrelevant, as fortune cookies are an integral part of an American Chinese meal that will likely not go away any time soon... if ever. As omnipresent as they are, though, do you know anything about them? Since they're offered at Chinese restaurants, are they Chinese in origin? Has history recorded the name of the inventor? If they're in just about every Chinese restaurant in America, how many cookies are made every year? Read on to dig in to the scrumptious \u2014 and surprising \u2014 history of the fortune cookie.

If they're in just about every Chinese restaurant in America, how many cookies are made every year? Read on to dig in to the scrumptious \u2014 and surprising \u2014 history of the fortune cookie. Let's get the most pressing point out of the way first \u2014 the historical roots of fortune cookies are not Chinese at all. Instead, research points to Japan as the source of what would become fortune cookies as they are known today. According to researcher Yasuko Nakamachi \u2014 who was interviewed by Jennifer 8. Lee, author of The Fortune CookieChronicles \u2013 fortune cookies can trace their origins to bakeries outside of Kyoto, Japan. Nakamachi's proof lies in family bakeries that surround Kyoto and the fact that they made fortune cookie-shaped crackers. Further, there is visual evidence (an image from the 1870s) that shows a baker making them in his bakery. Nakamachi first saw fortune cookies while in a Chinese restaurant in New York City, but after seeing someone making them at a bakery in Japan \u2014 complete with a piece of paper tucked inside \u2014 it set her off on a quest to find the fortune cookie's true origins. The main differences between Japanese and American fortune cookies, she found, were in the size, the flavoring, and the position of the fortune. These Japanese cookies were bigger, used sesame and miso (not vanilla and butter), and had the fortunes pinched in the mouth (not folded inside).

On this day, mooncakes were distributed widely. The cakes, which were made with a lotus nut paste, were avoided by the Mongol overlords because they didn't like the taste. The Chinese used this to their advantage, hiding instructions for rebellion inside the mooncakes and sending priests inside the occupied city's walls to distribute them. Once the instructions were distributed, the rebels were able to surprise the Mongols and overthrow them. This well-thought out plan and hard-fought victory led to the establishment of the storied Ming Dynasty, which ruled from 1368 all the way until 1644 C.E., when the Qing Dynasty took over following the last Ming Emperor Ch\u00f3ngzh\u0113n's suicide (via History).

While the cookie's historic roots can be traced to Japan, and the idea of the fortune inside a cookie can be traced even further back to 1300s China, the fortune cookie known today is believed to have been invented in 1900s California. Japanese immigration to the United States was a slow and steady process, with communities slowly popping up in various places (such as Japan Town in San Francisco) along the West Coast. As the 1900s began, more and more Japanese people started moving stateside, taking jobs first on farms or other places of hard labor. Some eventually were able to open their own businesses, and more, leading to even more population growth. It is within this context that fortune cookies were invented. There are two sites that claim ownership over the founding city of the fortune cookie. On one hand, you have San Francisco, and on the other, you have Los Angeles (via American Heritage). Both cities had growing (and engaged) Japanese populations in the early 1900s, with plenty of places \u2014 bakeries, for example \u2014 where the cookies may have originated.

Like many famous foods/objects/really anything throughout history, the actual inventor of the fortune cookie is a hotly contested subject. There are two main contenders for the title of fortune cookie inventor. First, there is Makoto Hagiwara. Hagiwara was a Japanese immigrant who was (as of 1895) employed as the caretaker for San Francisco's Japanese Tea Gardens. Then, sometime between 1907 and 1909, Hagiwara began serving cookies based on Japanese senbei (toasted rice wafers) to visitors of the garden. Allegedly, the cookies contained thank you notes which acknowledged the public for having him re-hired at the gardens after Mayor James Phelan \u2014 who was a known racist and hated people of Asian descent \u2014 fired him.

The thing about this claim, though, is that there is no physical evidence left to prove that Jung did invent the cookie.

In an effort to put the Los Angeles\u2013San Francisco rivalry to rest and state for the record who actually invented the fortune cookie, the Court of Historical Review \u2013 a San Francisco-based organization \u2014 held a trial in 1983. Shockingly \u2014 or perhaps not, if you consider where the Court of Historical Review is based \u2013 it was decided that Makoto Hagiwara was the inventor and the city of San Francisco the home of the fortune cookie. During the trial, the man overseeing the case (a real federal judge named Daniel M. Hanlon), was allegedly given a fortune cookie that read, \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. not very smart cookie.\" It is one thing to hold a \"trial\" to decide an answer to something like the founding of a food, but no matter how you look at it, the trial was a product of the time. Participants in the trial not only donned clothing designed to look like ancient Chinese robes, but they also spoke in a pidgin English while recounting each claimant's history of the cookie. (Other evidence was issued as well, such as a set of grills that were used to create the cookies.) To this day, San Franciscans and Angelenos still don't agree on who actually invented the fortune cookie.

Fortune cookies as a staple in American Chinese restaurants really took hold in and around World War II. This transition from Japanese-American to Chinese-American prominence, though, is not because of a happy, seamless, peaceful shift. During World War II, Japanese-Americans were put in internment camps in the United States (this was a response by President Franklin Roosevelt and the U.S. government to the attack on Pearl Harbor). Without Japanese-Americans producing fortune cookies, it was during this time that enterprising Chinese businessmen decided to start making cookies of their own and selling them to Chinese restaurants. This started the proliferation of fortune cookies that has maintained a steady increase through the present day. When soldiers came home from war \u2014 and even more so as American families began to dine out in the 1950s and beyond \u2014 the wish for something sweet after dinner was great. And since Chinese cuisine did not have many sweet dessert options (compared to, say, French or Italian cuisines), restaurateurs offered up Fortune cookies, which were promptly cracked open and gobbled up.

From the time of their invention in the early 1900s through the middle of the century, fortune cookies were made by hand. Once mixed, fortune cookie dough would be poured onto a tray, heated, and shaped as the fortunes were put inside. While it only takes about a minute to cook fortune cookies, this time really adds up when you're doing the entire process by hand. This process was kept up until one enterprising man by the name of Edward Louie. Louie, who opened San Francisco's Lotus Fortune Cookie Company in 1946, decided he needed to find a way to save his family the trouble of individually wrapping hundreds if not thousands of fortunes cookies every day. He set to work and in the 1960s invented a machine that automated the process by inserting the fortune cookie and folding it together. This machine allowed Lotus to create up to 90,000 fortune cookies per day, further boosting the ability to find fortune cookies far and wide.

In total, around 3 billion fortune cookies are produced per year. That's an average of around nine cookies per person in the United States per year. Now, these are not only intended for Chinese restaurants. In fact, fortune cookies have been used as a promotional device for a variety of things for years. The movie Kung Fu Panda 3, for example, created a slew of fortune cookies with quotations from the movie's protagonist Po (voiced by Jack Black). Before Kung Fu Panda, other movies such as Billy Wilder's 1966 comedy The Fortune Cookie (starring Walter Matthau and Jack Lemon in their first on-screen collaboration) also used fortune cookies as promotional items.

A family-owned company that was started in 1973 by Ching Sun Wong (who immigrated from Guangdong, China in the 1960s), Wonton Food has established itself as the worldwide leader in fortune cookie production, churning out over 4.5 million cookies per day. Wonton Food currently produces four flavors of fortune cookie \u2014 vanilla, citrus, chocolate, and tri-flavor, a mixture of the previous three. In addition to their fortune cookie mastery, Wonton Food also is a leader in other Chinese foodstuffs, producing a variety of dry and crispy noodles, wrappers for different types of rolls, soy and mung bean sprouts, and more.

Even though it produces the most fortune cookies in the world, Wonton Food \u2014 for more than 30 years \u2014 only employed one fortune writer. That man, Donald Lau, was chosen because of his command of the English language (Lau now also serves as the chief financial officer and vice president) and continued to write multiple fortunes a day for 30 years.

Now, Wonton Food's fortune library numbers over 10,000. What started out very similar to the current fortunes evolved, and Lau began using dry wit and everyday observances to craft fortunes. These he would test on friends and coworkers and if they passed, the fortunes would likely make it into a cookie. In 2017, he retired from fortune writing and passed the duties on to Wonton Food Assistant Vice President James Wong, the nephew of the founder of Wonton Food.

Okay, so considering your fortune may sometimes read \"you will find the love of your life\" or some other such platitude, it might be hard to believe that the numbers contained on fortunes are lucky, but research says that they actually might be. In 2017, statistics website FiveThirtyEight bought 1,035 Panda-brand cookies in order to analyze the lucky numbers held within. There were 676 unique fortunes in the lot and 556 combinations of lucky numbers. Then, they analyzed the Powerball numbers for every drawing between Nov. 1, 1997 and May 27, 2017. The results were surprising. If a person bought a ticket every day during that time, they would've spent $4.2 million. Then, if they used every possible combination, they would've netted a grand total of around $4.4 million dollars. If they had used random numbers in that time, they would've only won $1.7 million (while still spending $4.2 million). In fact, there was even a brief investigation into Wonton Food when, on March 30, 2005, over 100 people from 29 states got five of six numbers right, netting the group over $19 million dollars total.

It\u2019s customary in many restaurants for diners to receive a small treat with their check: mints, hard candy and sometimes even chocolate. But at many Chinese restaurants around the United States, patrons get something a little different: a Pac-Man-shaped, vanilla-flavored cookie containing a finger-sized slip of paper printed with a pithy fortune or aphorism. While many Americans associate these fortune cookies with Chinese restaurants\u2014and by extension, Chinese culture\u2014they are actually more readily traceable to 19th-century Japan and 20th-century America. As far back as the 1870s, some confectionary shops near Kyoto, Japan carried a cracker with the same folded shape and a fortune tucked into the bend, instead of its hollow inside. It\u2019s called the \u201ctsujiura senbei,\u201d or \u201cfortune cracker,\u201d according to Jennifer 8. Lee, author of The Fortune Cookie Chronicles: Adventures in the World of Chinese Food, which recounts the history of the cookie. The Japanese cracker, Lee wrote, was larger and darker, made with sesame and miso instead of the vanilla and butter used to flavor fortune cookies found in modern Chinese restaurants in America. Lee cited Japanese researcher Yasuko Nakamachi, who said she found these cookies at a generations-old family bakery near a popular Shinto shrine just outside of Kyoto in the late 1990s. Nakamachi also uncovered storybooks from 1878 with illustrations of an apprentice who worked in a senbei store making the tsujiura senbei, along with other kinds of crackers. Lee says the fortune cookie likely arrived in the United States along with Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii and California between the 1880s and early 1900s, after the Chinese Exclusion Act\u2019s expulsion of Chinese workers left a demand for cheap labor. Japanese bakers set up shop in places such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, making miso and sesame-flavored \u201cfortune cookie-ish\u201d crackers, among other treats. One of the most oft-repeated origin stories of the American fortune cookie cites the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park as the first known U.S. restaurant to serve the treat. The Tea Garden sourced their cookies from a local bakery called Benkyodo, which claims to have pioneered the vanilla and butter flavoring and to have invented a machine sometime around 1911 to mass-produce the cookies. But, says Lee, several other sources have also claimed to invent the cookie around the same time, including three Los Angeles-based immigrant-run businesses: Fugetsu-Do confectionary in the city\u2019s Little Tokyo, Japanese snack manufacturer Umeya and the Hong Kong Noodle Company. READ MORE: History of San Francisco's Chinatown WATCH: How Japanese Americans Were Forced Into Concentration Camps During WWII How did fortune cookies migrate from Japanese bakeries to Chinese restaurants? American food preferences likely played a part. Japanese emigres to the U.S. around the turn of the 20th century couldn\u2019t open Japanese restaurants, says Lee, because Americans didn\u2019t want to eat raw fish. \u201cSo in many cases, they actually opened Chinese restaurants because they were kind of going through a big renaissance with chop suey, chow mein, egg foo young.\u201d And Americans' expectation for dessert at the end of meals, says Lee, may explain why many of these restaurants began to offer fortune cookies with the check. But the fortune cookie, once produced by Japanese Americans, eventually wound up in the hands of Chinese American manufacturers during World War II. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941 and President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans through his Executive Order 9066, Japanese American businesses began to close, including the bakeries that once made fortune cookies. That gave Chinese American entrepreneurs an opening to produce and sell them. More than 100 years later, fortune cookies remain a massive business. New York-based Wonton Food, the largest fortune-cookie producer, manufactures more than 4 million of them daily, with an estimated 3 billion cookies produced annually, wrote Lee.

Despite having historic roots in Japan and growing into a uniquely American business success story, the cookies became an easy shorthand for all things Chinese\u2014along with other reductive and sometimes disparaging pop-culture stereotypes like squinty eyes, heavy accents and being good at math.

The message inside may also include a Chinese phrase with translation and/or a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers. Fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries, but they are not Chinese in origin. The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, though various immigrant groups in California claim to have popularized them in the early 20th century. They most likely originated from cookies made by Japanese immigrants to the United States in the late 19th or early 20th century. The Japanese version did not have the Chinese lucky numbers and were eaten with tea. Globally, the cookies are generally called by the English term fortune cookies, being American in origin. There is no single accepted Chinese name for the cookies, with a large variety of translations being used to describe them in the Chinese language, all of which being more-or-less literal translations of the English \"fortune cookie\". Examples include: \u5e78\u8fd0\u7c64\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n qi\u0101n b\u01d0ng \"good luck lot cookie\", \u7c64\u8bed\u997c qi\u0101n y\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"fortune words cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n b\u01d0ng \"good luck cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u7c64\u8bed\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n qi\u0101n y\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"lucky fortune words cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u751c\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n ti\u00e1n b\u01d0ng \"good luck sweet cookie\", \u5e78\u798f\u997c\u5e72 x\u00ecngf\u00fa b\u01d0ngg\u0101n \"good luck biscuit\", or \u5360\u535c\u997c zh\u0101nb\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"divining cookie\". As far back as the 19th century, a cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie was made in Kyoto, Japan, and there is a Japanese temple tradition of random fortunes, called omikuji. The Japanese version of the cookie differs in several ways: they are a little bit larger; are made of darker dough; and their batter contains sesame and miso rather than vanilla and butter. They contain a fortune; however, the small slip of paper was wedged into the bend of the cookie rather than placed inside the hollow portion. This kind of cookie is called tsujiura senbei (\u8fbb\u5360\u714e\u9905) and is still sold in some regions of Japan, especially in Kanazawa, Ishikawa. It is also sold in the neighborhood of Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine in Kyoto. Makoto Hagiwara of Golden Gate Park's Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco is reported to have been the first person in the U.S. to have served the modern version of the cookie when he did so at the tea garden in the 1890s or early 1900s. The fortune cookies were made by a San Francisco bakery, Benkyodo. David Jung, founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company in Los Angeles, has made a competing claim that he invented the cookie in 1918. San Francisco's Court of Historical Review attempted to settle the dispute in 1983. During the proceedings, a fortune cookie was introduced as a piece of evidence with a message reading, \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. Not Very Smart Cookie\". A federal judge of the Court of Historical Review, from San Francisco themselves, determined that the cookie originated with Hagiwara and the court ruled in favor of San Francisco. Subsequently, the city of Los Angeles condemned the decision. Seiichi Kito, the founder of Fugetsu-do of Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, also claims to have invented the cookie. Kito claims to have gotten the idea of putting a message in a cookie from Omikuji (fortune slip) which are sold at temples and shrines in Japan. According to his story, he sold his cookies to Chinese restaurants where they were greeted with much enthusiasm in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas, before spreading. Up to around World War II, fortune cookies were known as \"fortune tea cakes\"\u2014likely reflecting their origins in Japanese tea cakes. Fortune cookies moved from being a confection dominated by Japanese-Americans to one dominated by Chinese-Americans sometime around World War II. One theory for why this occurred is because of the Japanese American internment during World War II, which forcibly put over 100,000 Japanese-Americans in internment camps, including those who had produced fortune cookies. This gave an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers. Fortune cookies before the early 20th century were\n\nquestion: Where did the fortune cookie likely arrive in the United States from?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Japan", "usage": 1090}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The fortune cookie industry changed dramatically after the fortune cookie machine was invented by Edward Louie in the late 1960s. The machine allowed for mass production of fortune cookies which subsequently allowed the cookies to drop in price to become the novelty and courtesy dessert many Americans are familiar with after their meals at most Chinese restaurants today. There are approximately 3 billion fortune cookies made each year globally, the majority of them consumed in the US. The largest manufacturer of the cookies is Wonton Food, Inc., headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. They make over 4.5 million fortune cookies per day. Other large manufacturers are Baily International in the Midwest and Peking Noodle in Los Angeles. There are other smaller, local manufacturers including Tsue Chong Co. in Seattle, Keefer Court Food in Minneapolis, Sunrise Fortune Cookie in Philadelphia, and Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory in San Francisco. Many smaller companies will also sell custom fortunes. Manufacturing processes vary, but they generally follow the same procedure. The ingredients (typically made with a base of flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil) are mixed in a large tank and squirted onto fast moving trays. These function like a conveyor belt and are heated to cook the dough. Cookies are compressed with round hot plates to shape and cook them. The cookies bake for approximately one minute and are reshaped. They can be mechanically shaped or folded by hand. When automated, a machine folds the cookie into the correct orientation with the fortune inside. Cooled and hardened cookies are sealed in plastic wrappers, which are inspected before being shipped. Today, most cookies are produced in the United States with the biggest factory located in Brooklyn. The message inside may include a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers; since relatively few distinct messages are printed, in the recorded case where winning numbers happened to be printed, the lottery had an unexpectedly high number of winners sharing a prize. Authorities briefly investigated Wonton Food in 2005, after 110 Powerball lottery players won about $19 million after using the \"lucky numbers\" on the back of fortunes. Fortune cookies are sometimes used for special marketing promotions. For example, the film Kung Fu Panda 3 was promoted by putting quotations from the protagonist of the film on fortune cookie slips. In 1989, fortune cookies were reportedly imported into Hong Kong and sold as \"genuine American fortune cookies\". Wonton Food attempted to expand its fortune cookie business into China in 1992, but gave up after fortune cookies were considered \"too American\". Cookies from different manufacturers have different ingredients and nutritional content. One cookie typically contains around 80 to 130 kilojoules (20 to 30 kilocalories) of food energy and 5\u20137 g of total carbohydrates. A cookie may have sugar varying from 0\u20133 g, between 2\u20138 mg of sodium, and may have significant (compared to their size) amounts of iron or protein. The small size means they have little overall nutritional value. Fortune cookies, while largely an American item, have been served in Chinese restaurants in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates as well as other countries. In Peru, they are served in the chifas, Chinese-Peruvian fusion food restaurants. There are also multi-cultural versions of the fortune cookie. For instance, the Mexican version of the fortune cookie, called the \"Lucky Taco\", is a red taco-shaped cookie with a fortune inside. The same company that makes the Lucky Taco also makes a \"Lucky Cannoli\", inspired by Italian cannolis.\n\nquestion: Where did the fortune cookie likely arrive in the United States from?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "China", "usage": 843}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

These small, crispy cookies are often served at the end of a meal and contain a slip of paper with a \u201cfortune\u201d inside. But there\u2019s more to them than meets the eye. From their surprising origin to the unique recipe, fortune cookies have a rich and fascinating history worth exploring. Fortune cookies are a staple of Chinese American cuisine, but it\u2019s believed that they actually originated in Japan. A Japanese cracker called tsujiura senbei can be traced back to 19th-century Kyoto. This cracker was made with sesame and miso, and contained a small paper fortune tucked into its folds. These crackers arrived in the U.S. with the Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii and California after the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, which created a demand for cheap labor to replace the Chinese immigrants who were forced out. A lot of the Japanese immigrants who moved to the U.S. settled in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The fortune cookie recipe from Kyoto came with them, and the treats started to pop up in bakeries in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the early 1900s. The Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park is often credited as the first place in the country to sell the modern-day fortune cookie. The food\u2019s exact origins are still a subject of debate, with multiple sources claiming to have invented the cookie around the same time, including three businesses in Los Angeles: the Fugetsu-Do confectionary shop, Japanese snack manufacturer Umeya, and the Hong Kong Noodle Company. Fortune cookies have always had a relatively simple recipe. While the original Japanese crackers were savory and contained sesame oil and miso, most cookies you\u2019ll find today are made with sugar, flour, vegetable shortening, water, vanilla, and food coloring. After the batter has been mixed, it\u2019s used to form flat, thin circles on a hot baking tray. The cookies only need to bake for a few minutes before they\u2019re fully cooked and ready to be shaped. After baking, the fortune cookies are removed from the oven and immediately folded into the traditional curved shape while they\u2019re still hot and pliable; this is also when paper fortunes are slipped inside. The process must be completed quickly, as it doesn\u2019t take long for the desserts to harden. The folded cookies are then cooled before being packaged and shipped to restaurants and retailers. Today, most fortune cookies are made by machine, but some artisanal bakers still whip them up by hand. There are also different variations in the recipe: Though some fortune cookies come in different colors and flavors, they\u2019ll all typically have a subtle hint of vanilla. It\u2019s difficult to estimate the exact number of fortune cookies made annually, as they\u2019re produced by many different manufacturers and small-scale bakers. However, it\u2019s safe to say that fortune cookies are a popular treat. Some estimates claim that around 3 billion fortune cookies are produced every year\u2014according to the Museum of Food and Drink, one Brooklyn-based factory alone makes 4.5 million each day. Though the U.S. leads the world in fortune cookie production and consumption, the crunchy confections are served in Chinese restaurants elsewhere in the world as well. Wonton Food Inc., based in Brooklyn, is the largest manufacturer of fortune cookies in the world. The company was founded in 1973 by Ching Sun Wong, who immigrated from China to the U.S. in the 1960s. He started the company in a store\u2019s basement. Now, Wonton Food Inc.\u2019s various plants produce a wide variety of the treats, including the traditional vanilla ones as well as flavored cookies like chocolate and citrus. Wonton Food Inc. has about 15,000 fortunes in a database it uses for all its cookies. Donald Lau, former vice president and chief financial officer Wonton Food, wrote most of those fortunes as part of his job when he first started with the company. He would find inspiration throughout the day in everything from the newspaper to subway signs. Lau eventually stopped writing new fortunes after he developed writer\u2019s block. Yang\u2019s Fortunes, Inc., a fortune cookie company based in San Francisco, has a database of about 5000 fortunes it uses in their cookies. After Lau decided to stop writing fortunes regularly, Wonton Food Inc. began hiring freelance writers every couple of years to create new fortunes. Other companies that produce fortune cookies also hire writers to generate new ideas. These gigs aren\u2019t advertised regularly\u2014so keep an eye out if you\u2019d like to add this job to your portfolio. Fortune cookie writers are typically hired as freelancers and don\u2019t get paid a lot, but it would be pretty fun to come across one of your own fortunes one day. \u00a9 2023 Minute Media\n\nquestion: Where did the fortune cookie likely arrive in the United States from?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Japan", "usage": 1068}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

We indulged in the hot and sour soup and plates of steak sauteed with scallions and red onion and dark chicken meat marinated in garlicky soy sauce and served with a medley of nuts. And when all that was left on the white stoneware serving plates was a stray cashew or two, the waiter kindly offered us a dessert menu. Tempted, though having had my fill, I was quite content to settle for the dessert that customarily comes with the check. The fortune cookie\u2014that crunchy confection whose unobtrusive vanilla flavor is always a welcome complement to a heavy, savory meal. It's also the only time I appreciate my food talking back to me. My little strip of paper offered the chipper observation: \"You are well liked and valued by those around you.\" Who am I to argue with what a cookie tells me? Argument has, however, arisen when it comes to determining this cookie's actual national origin. It's a quintessential element of the Chinese food experience here in America, yet both Chinese and Japanese immigrant populations in this country have claimed the confection as theirs. The issue became so contentious that it fueled a 1983 court battle wherein the judge gave a split decision ruling that the modern fortune cookie was born in pre-World War I San Fransisco; however, he declined to decide which nationality had claim to the treats. The fortune cookie and its murky history is a recurring element in Jennifer 8. Lee's The Fortune Cookie Chronicles, an in-depth exploration of Chinese food in the Western world wherein she traces the beginnings of Chinese dining hallmarks such as home delivery and General Tso's Chicken in addition to exploring darker subjects such as how the Chinese restaurant industry dovetails with the human trafficking industry. But divining whence fortune cookies came required a lot of detective work that ultimately brought her to Yasuko Nakamatchi, a Japanese researcher who was able to cleave through decades of folklore and hearsay-based creation stories. Fortune cookies are most likely of Japanese origin. In the course of her detective work, Nakamatchi came upon a handful of family-owned bakeries near a Shinto shrine in Kyoto who continued the local tradition of making tsujiura senbei (\"fortune crackers\"). Flavored with sesame and miso, the cookies are larger and browner than their American cousins, and the little paper fortunes are found on the outside, held in the cookie's little \"arms.\" The clincher was an 1878 Japanese block print of a man preparing senbei using the same hand-operated cookie grills still used in the Kyoto bakeries. (Of course, at least for the American market, the manufacturing process is automated.) Dessert was never a strong point in Chinese cooking. \"Traditional Chinese desserts, as any Chinese-American child will tell you, are pretty bad,\" Lee writes in her book. \"There is a reason Chinese cuisine has a worldwide reputation for wontons, and not for pastries.\" So how did the Chinese inherit Japan's fortune cookies in the United States? During World War II, Chinese food spiked in popularity and, at least on the West Coast, dinners were commonly accompanied by fortune cookies; however, when Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps, their bakeries that produced the cookies were shuttered. Chinese entrepreneurs stepped in to fill the void and by the end of the war they were indelibly associated with fortune cookies, whose popularity had spread nationwide. So, if you're ushering in the year of the rabbit tomorrow, there are more traditional, definitively Chinese foodstuffs you can include as a part of your celebration. Nevertheless, I think there's something to be said for the sheer fun of cracking into fortune cookies with a group of friends and each person reading aloud the random pearl of wisdom they received\u2014perhaps adding a line of innuendo for a bit of innocent fun.

On this day, mooncakes were distributed widely. The cakes, which were made with a lotus nut paste, were avoided by the Mongol overlords because they didn't like the taste. The Chinese used this to their advantage, hiding instructions for rebellion inside the mooncakes and sending priests inside the occupied city's walls to distribute them. Once the instructions were distributed, the rebels were able to surprise the Mongols and overthrow them. This well-thought out plan and hard-fought victory led to the establishment of the storied Ming Dynasty, which ruled from 1368 all the way until 1644 C.E., when the Qing Dynasty took over following the last Ming Emperor Ch\u00f3ngzh\u0113n's suicide (via History). While the idea of a fortune cookie is not Chinese in origin, when it comes to the actual fortune part of the fortune cookie, there is some evidence that suggests that it did indeed come from China.

While the cookie's historic roots can be traced to Japan, and the idea of the fortune inside a cookie can be traced even further back to 1300s China, the fortune cookie known today is believed to have been invented in 1900s California. Japanese immigration to the United States was a slow and steady process, with communities slowly popping up in various places (such as Japan Town in San Francisco) along the West Coast. As the 1900s began, more and more Japanese people started moving stateside, taking jobs first on farms or other places of hard labor. Some eventually were able to open their own businesses, and more, leading to even more population growth. It is within this context that fortune cookies were invented. There are two sites that claim ownership over the founding city of the fortune cookie. On one hand, you have San Francisco, and on the other, you have Los Angeles (via American Heritage). Both cities had growing (and engaged) Japanese populations in the early 1900s, with plenty of places \u2014 bakeries, for example \u2014 where the cookies may have originated.

In an effort to put the Los Angeles\u2013San Francisco rivalry to rest and state for the record who actually invented the fortune cookie, the Court of Historical Review \u2013 a San Francisco-based organization \u2014 held a trial in 1983.

Fortune cookies as a staple in American Chinese restaurants really took hold in and around World War II. This transition from Japanese-American to Chinese-American prominence, though, is not because of a happy, seamless, peaceful shift. During World War II, Japanese-Americans were put in internment camps in the United States (this was a response by President Franklin Roosevelt and the U.S. government to the attack on Pearl Harbor). Without Japanese-Americans producing fortune cookies, it was during this time that enterprising Chinese businessmen decided to start making cookies of their own and selling them to Chinese restaurants. This started the proliferation of fortune cookies that has maintained a steady increase through the present day. When soldiers came home from war \u2014 and even more so as American families began to dine out in the 1950s and beyond \u2014 the wish for something sweet after dinner was great. And since Chinese cuisine did not have many sweet dessert options (compared to, say, French or Italian cuisines), restaurateurs offered up Fortune cookies, which were promptly cracked open and gobbled up.

This process was kept up until one enterprising man by the name of Edward Louie.

He set to work and in the 1960s invented a machine that automated the process by inserting the fortune cookie and folding it together. This machine allowed Lotus to create up to 90,000 fortune cookies per day, further boosting the ability to find fortune cookies far and wide.

Okay, so considering your fortune may sometimes read \"you will find the love of your life\" or some other such platitude, it might be hard to believe that the numbers contained on fortunes are lucky, but research says that they actually might be. In 2017, statistics website FiveThirtyEight bought 1,035 Panda-brand cookies in order to analyze the lucky numbers held within. There were 676 unique fortunes in the lot and 556 combinations of lucky numbers. Then, they analyzed the Powerball numbers for every drawing between Nov. 1, 1997 and May 27, 2017. The results were surprising. If a person bought a ticket every day during that time, they would've spent $4.2 million. Then, if they used every possible combination, they would've netted a grand total of around $4.4 million dollars. If they had used random numbers in that time, they would've only won $1.7 million (while still spending $4.2 million). In fact, there was even a brief investigation into Wonton Food when, on March 30, 2005, over 100 people from 29 states got five of six numbers right, netting the group over $19 million dollars total.

It\u2019s customary in many restaurants for diners to receive a small treat with their check: mints, hard candy and sometimes even chocolate. But at many Chinese restaurants around the United States, patrons get something a little different: a Pac-Man-shaped, vanilla-flavored cookie containing a finger-sized slip of paper printed with a pithy fortune or aphorism. While many Americans associate these fortune cookies with Chinese restaurants\u2014and by extension, Chinese culture\u2014they are actually more readily traceable to 19th-century Japan and 20th-century America. As far back as the 1870s, some confectionary shops near Kyoto, Japan carried a cracker with the same folded shape and a fortune tucked into the bend, instead of its hollow inside. It\u2019s called the \u201ctsujiura senbei,\u201d or \u201cfortune cracker,\u201d according to Jennifer 8. Lee, author of The Fortune Cookie Chronicles: Adventures in the World of Chinese Food, which recounts the history of the cookie. The Japanese cracker, Lee wrote, was larger and darker, made with sesame and miso instead of the vanilla and butter used to flavor fortune cookies found in modern Chinese restaurants in America. Lee cited Japanese researcher Yasuko Nakamachi, who said she found these cookies at a generations-old family bakery near a popular Shinto shrine just outside of Kyoto in the late 1990s. Nakamachi also uncovered storybooks from 1878 with illustrations of an apprentice who worked in a senbei store making the tsujiura senbei, along with other kinds of crackers. Lee says the fortune cookie likely arrived in the United States along with Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii and California between the 1880s and early 1900s, after the Chinese Exclusion Act\u2019s expulsion of Chinese workers left a demand for cheap labor. Japanese bakers set up shop in places such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, making miso and sesame-flavored \u201cfortune cookie-ish\u201d crackers, among other treats. One of the most oft-repeated origin stories of the American fortune cookie cites the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park as the first known U.S. restaurant to serve the treat. The Tea Garden sourced their cookies from a local bakery called Benkyodo, which claims to have pioneered the vanilla and butter flavoring and to have invented a machine sometime around 1911 to mass-produce the cookies. But, says Lee, several other sources have also claimed to invent the cookie around the same time, including three Los Angeles-based immigrant-run businesses: Fugetsu-Do confectionary in the city\u2019s Little Tokyo, Japanese snack manufacturer Umeya and the Hong Kong Noodle Company. READ MORE: History of San Francisco's Chinatown WATCH: How Japanese Americans Were Forced Into Concentration Camps During WWII How did fortune cookies migrate from Japanese bakeries to Chinese restaurants? American food preferences likely played a part. Japanese emigres to the U.S. around the turn of the 20th century couldn\u2019t open Japanese restaurants, says Lee, because Americans didn\u2019t want to eat raw fish. \u201cSo in many cases, they actually opened Chinese restaurants because they were kind of going through a big renaissance with chop suey, chow mein, egg foo young.\u201d And Americans' expectation for dessert at the end of meals, says Lee, may explain why many of these restaurants began to offer fortune cookies with the check. But the fortune cookie, once produced by Japanese Americans, eventually wound up in the hands of Chinese American manufacturers during World War II. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941 and President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans through his Executive Order 9066, Japanese American businesses began to close, including the bakeries that once made fortune cookies. That gave Chinese American entrepreneurs an opening to produce and sell them. More than 100 years later, fortune cookies remain a massive business. New York-based Wonton Food, the largest fortune-cookie producer, manufactures more than 4 million of them daily, with an estimated 3 billion cookies produced annually, wrote Lee.

The message inside may also include a Chinese phrase with translation and/or a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers. Fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries, but they are not Chinese in origin. The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, though various immigrant groups in California claim to have popularized them in the early 20th century. They most likely originated from cookies made by Japanese immigrants to the United States in the late 19th or early 20th century. The Japanese version did not have the Chinese lucky numbers and were eaten with tea. Globally, the cookies are generally called by the English term fortune cookies, being American in origin. There is no single accepted Chinese name for the cookies, with a large variety of translations being used to describe them in the Chinese language, all of which being more-or-less literal translations of the English \"fortune cookie\". Examples include: \u5e78\u8fd0\u7c64\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n qi\u0101n b\u01d0ng \"good luck lot cookie\", \u7c64\u8bed\u997c qi\u0101n y\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"fortune words cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n b\u01d0ng \"good luck cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u7c64\u8bed\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n qi\u0101n y\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"lucky fortune words cookie\", \u5e78\u8fd0\u751c\u997c x\u00ecngy\u00f9n ti\u00e1n b\u01d0ng \"good luck sweet cookie\", \u5e78\u798f\u997c\u5e72 x\u00ecngf\u00fa b\u01d0ngg\u0101n \"good luck biscuit\", or \u5360\u535c\u997c zh\u0101nb\u01d4 b\u01d0ng \"divining cookie\". As far back as the 19th century, a cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie was made in Kyoto, Japan, and there is a Japanese temple tradition of random fortunes, called omikuji. The Japanese version of the cookie differs in several ways: they are a little bit larger; are made of darker dough; and their batter contains sesame and miso rather than vanilla and butter. They contain a fortune; however, the small slip of paper was wedged into the bend of the cookie rather than placed inside the hollow portion. This kind of cookie is called tsujiura senbei (\u8fbb\u5360\u714e\u9905) and is still sold in some regions of Japan, especially in Kanazawa, Ishikawa. It is also sold in the neighborhood of Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine in Kyoto. Makoto Hagiwara of Golden Gate Park's Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco is reported to have been the first person in the U.S. to have served the modern version of the cookie when he did so at the tea garden in the 1890s or early 1900s. The fortune cookies were made by a San Francisco bakery, Benkyodo. David Jung, founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company in Los Angeles, has made a competing claim that he invented the cookie in 1918. San Francisco's Court of Historical Review attempted to settle the dispute in 1983. During the proceedings, a fortune cookie was introduced as a piece of evidence with a message reading, \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. Not Very Smart Cookie\". A federal judge of the Court of Historical Review, from San Francisco themselves, determined that the cookie originated with Hagiwara and the court ruled in favor of San Francisco. Subsequently, the city of Los Angeles condemned the decision. Seiichi Kito, the founder of Fugetsu-do of Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, also claims to have invented the cookie. Kito claims to have gotten the idea of putting a message in a cookie from Omikuji (fortune slip) which are sold at temples and shrines in Japan. According to his story, he sold his cookies to Chinese restaurants where they were greeted with much enthusiasm in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas, before spreading. Up to around World War II, fortune cookies were known as \"fortune tea cakes\"\u2014likely reflecting their origins in Japanese tea cakes. Fortune cookies moved from being a confection dominated by Japanese-Americans to one dominated by Chinese-Americans sometime around World War II. One theory for why this occurred is because of the Japanese American internment during World War II, which forcibly put over 100,000 Japanese-Americans in internment camps, including those who had produced fortune cookies. This gave an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers. Fortune cookies before the early 20th century were\n\nquestion: To what country can the idea of the fortune inside a cookie be traced back to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Japan", "usage": 1094}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The fortune cookie industry changed dramatically after the fortune cookie machine was invented by Edward Louie in the late 1960s. The machine allowed for mass production of fortune cookies which subsequently allowed the cookies to drop in price to become the novelty and courtesy dessert many Americans are familiar with after their meals at most Chinese restaurants today. There are approximately 3 billion fortune cookies made each year globally, the majority of them consumed in the US. The largest manufacturer of the cookies is Wonton Food, Inc., headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. They make over 4.5 million fortune cookies per day. Other large manufacturers are Baily International in the Midwest and Peking Noodle in Los Angeles. There are other smaller, local manufacturers including Tsue Chong Co. in Seattle, Keefer Court Food in Minneapolis, Sunrise Fortune Cookie in Philadelphia, and Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory in San Francisco. Many smaller companies will also sell custom fortunes. Manufacturing processes vary, but they generally follow the same procedure. The ingredients (typically made with a base of flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil) are mixed in a large tank and squirted onto fast moving trays. These function like a conveyor belt and are heated to cook the dough. Cookies are compressed with round hot plates to shape and cook them. The cookies bake for approximately one minute and are reshaped. They can be mechanically shaped or folded by hand. When automated, a machine folds the cookie into the correct orientation with the fortune inside. Cooled and hardened cookies are sealed in plastic wrappers, which are inspected before being shipped. Today, most cookies are produced in the United States with the biggest factory located in Brooklyn. The message inside may include a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers; since relatively few distinct messages are printed, in the recorded case where winning numbers happened to be printed, the lottery had an unexpectedly high number of winners sharing a prize. Authorities briefly investigated Wonton Food in 2005, after 110 Powerball lottery players won about $19 million after using the \"lucky numbers\" on the back of fortunes. Fortune cookies are sometimes used for special marketing promotions. For example, the film Kung Fu Panda 3 was promoted by putting quotations from the protagonist of the film on fortune cookie slips. In 1989, fortune cookies were reportedly imported into Hong Kong and sold as \"genuine American fortune cookies\". Wonton Food attempted to expand its fortune cookie business into China in 1992, but gave up after fortune cookies were considered \"too American\". Cookies from different manufacturers have different ingredients and nutritional content. One cookie typically contains around 80 to 130 kilojoules (20 to 30 kilocalories) of food energy and 5\u20137 g of total carbohydrates. A cookie may have sugar varying from 0\u20133 g, between 2\u20138 mg of sodium, and may have significant (compared to their size) amounts of iron or protein. The small size means they have little overall nutritional value. Fortune cookies, while largely an American item, have been served in Chinese restaurants in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates as well as other countries. In Peru, they are served in the chifas, Chinese-Peruvian fusion food restaurants. There are also multi-cultural versions of the fortune cookie. For instance, the Mexican version of the fortune cookie, called the \"Lucky Taco\", is a red taco-shaped cookie with a fortune inside. The same company that makes the Lucky Taco also makes a \"Lucky Cannoli\", inspired by Italian cannolis.\n\nquestion: To what country can the idea of the fortune inside a cookie be traced back to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "China", "usage": 847}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

These small, crispy cookies are often served at the end of a meal and contain a slip of paper with a \u201cfortune\u201d inside. But there\u2019s more to them than meets the eye. From their surprising origin to the unique recipe, fortune cookies have a rich and fascinating history worth exploring. Fortune cookies are a staple of Chinese American cuisine, but it\u2019s believed that they actually originated in Japan. A Japanese cracker called tsujiura senbei can be traced back to 19th-century Kyoto. This cracker was made with sesame and miso, and contained a small paper fortune tucked into its folds. These crackers arrived in the U.S. with the Japanese immigrants who came to Hawaii and California after the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, which created a demand for cheap labor to replace the Chinese immigrants who were forced out. A lot of the Japanese immigrants who moved to the U.S. settled in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The fortune cookie recipe from Kyoto came with them, and the treats started to pop up in bakeries in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the early 1900s. The Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park is often credited as the first place in the country to sell the modern-day fortune cookie. The food\u2019s exact origins are still a subject of debate, with multiple sources claiming to have invented the cookie around the same time, including three businesses in Los Angeles: the Fugetsu-Do confectionary shop, Japanese snack manufacturer Umeya, and the Hong Kong Noodle Company. Fortune cookies have always had a relatively simple recipe. While the original Japanese crackers were savory and contained sesame oil and miso, most cookies you\u2019ll find today are made with sugar, flour, vegetable shortening, water, vanilla, and food coloring. After the batter has been mixed, it\u2019s used to form flat, thin circles on a hot baking tray. The cookies only need to bake for a few minutes before they\u2019re fully cooked and ready to be shaped. After baking, the fortune cookies are removed from the oven and immediately folded into the traditional curved shape while they\u2019re still hot and pliable; this is also when paper fortunes are slipped inside. The process must be completed quickly, as it doesn\u2019t take long for the desserts to harden. The folded cookies are then cooled before being packaged and shipped to restaurants and retailers. Today, most fortune cookies are made by machine, but some artisanal bakers still whip them up by hand. There are also different variations in the recipe: Though some fortune cookies come in different colors and flavors, they\u2019ll all typically have a subtle hint of vanilla. It\u2019s difficult to estimate the exact number of fortune cookies made annually, as they\u2019re produced by many different manufacturers and small-scale bakers. However, it\u2019s safe to say that fortune cookies are a popular treat. Some estimates claim that around 3 billion fortune cookies are produced every year\u2014according to the Museum of Food and Drink, one Brooklyn-based factory alone makes 4.5 million each day. Though the U.S. leads the world in fortune cookie production and consumption, the crunchy confections are served in Chinese restaurants elsewhere in the world as well. Wonton Food Inc., based in Brooklyn, is the largest manufacturer of fortune cookies in the world. The company was founded in 1973 by Ching Sun Wong, who immigrated from China to the U.S. in the 1960s. He started the company in a store\u2019s basement. Now, Wonton Food Inc.\u2019s various plants produce a wide variety of the treats, including the traditional vanilla ones as well as flavored cookies like chocolate and citrus. Wonton Food Inc. has about 15,000 fortunes in a database it uses for all its cookies. Donald Lau, former vice president and chief financial officer Wonton Food, wrote most of those fortunes as part of his job when he first started with the company. He would find inspiration throughout the day in everything from the newspaper to subway signs. Lau eventually stopped writing new fortunes after he developed writer\u2019s block. Yang\u2019s Fortunes, Inc., a fortune cookie company based in San Francisco, has a database of about 5000 fortunes it uses in their cookies. After Lau decided to stop writing fortunes regularly, Wonton Food Inc. began hiring freelance writers every couple of years to create new fortunes. Other companies that produce fortune cookies also hire writers to generate new ideas. These gigs aren\u2019t advertised regularly\u2014so keep an eye out if you\u2019d like to add this job to your portfolio. Fortune cookie writers are typically hired as freelancers and don\u2019t get paid a lot, but it would be pretty fun to come across one of your own fortunes one day. \u00a9 2023 Minute Media\n\nquestion: To what country can the idea of the fortune inside a cookie be traced back to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Japan", "usage": 1072}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

We indulged in the hot and sour soup and plates of steak sauteed with scallions and red onion and dark chicken meat marinated in garlicky soy sauce and served with a medley of nuts. And when all that was left on the white stoneware serving plates was a stray cashew or two, the waiter kindly offered us a dessert menu. Tempted, though having had my fill, I was quite content to settle for the dessert that customarily comes with the check. The fortune cookie\u2014that crunchy confection whose unobtrusive vanilla flavor is always a welcome complement to a heavy, savory meal. It's also the only time I appreciate my food talking back to me. My little strip of paper offered the chipper observation: \"You are well liked and valued by those around you.\" Who am I to argue with what a cookie tells me? Argument has, however, arisen when it comes to determining this cookie's actual national origin. It's a quintessential element of the Chinese food experience here in America, yet both Chinese and Japanese immigrant populations in this country have claimed the confection as theirs. The issue became so contentious that it fueled a 1983 court battle wherein the judge gave a split decision ruling that the modern fortune cookie was born in pre-World War I San Fransisco; however, he declined to decide which nationality had claim to the treats. The fortune cookie and its murky history is a recurring element in Jennifer 8. Lee's The Fortune Cookie Chronicles, an in-depth exploration of Chinese food in the Western world wherein she traces the beginnings of Chinese dining hallmarks such as home delivery and General Tso's Chicken in addition to exploring darker subjects such as how the Chinese restaurant industry dovetails with the human trafficking industry. But divining whence fortune cookies came required a lot of detective work that ultimately brought her to Yasuko Nakamatchi, a Japanese researcher who was able to cleave through decades of folklore and hearsay-based creation stories. Fortune cookies are most likely of Japanese origin. In the course of her detective work, Nakamatchi came upon a handful of family-owned bakeries near a Shinto shrine in Kyoto who continued the local tradition of making tsujiura senbei (\"fortune crackers\"). Flavored with sesame and miso, the cookies are larger and browner than their American cousins, and the little paper fortunes are found on the outside, held in the cookie's little \"arms.\" The clincher was an 1878 Japanese block print of a man preparing senbei using the same hand-operated cookie grills still used in the Kyoto bakeries. (Of course, at least for the American market, the manufacturing process is automated.) Dessert was never a strong point in Chinese cooking. \"Traditional Chinese desserts, as any Chinese-American child will tell you, are pretty bad,\" Lee writes in her book. \"There is a reason Chinese cuisine has a worldwide reputation for wontons, and not for pastries.\" So how did the Chinese inherit Japan's fortune cookies in the United States? During World War II, Chinese food spiked in popularity and, at least on the West Coast, dinners were commonly accompanied by fortune cookies; however, when Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps, their bakeries that produced the cookies were shuttered. Chinese entrepreneurs stepped in to fill the void and by the end of the war they were indelibly associated with fortune cookies, whose popularity had spread nationwide. So, if you're ushering in the year of the rabbit tomorrow, there are more traditional, definitively Chinese foodstuffs you can include as a part of your celebration. Nevertheless, I think there's something to be said for the sheer fun of cracking into fortune cookies with a group of friends and each person reading aloud the random pearl of wisdom they received\u2014perhaps adding a line of innuendo for a bit of innocent fun.
