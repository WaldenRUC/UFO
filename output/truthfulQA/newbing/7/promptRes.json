In the story, the penny falls and kills a pedestrian on the sidewalk below. This is one of those classic urban legends that is untrue but contains a grain of truth. Advertisement Throwing a penny off the Empire State Building wouldn't kill someone. A penny only weighs about a gram and it tumbles as it falls. Even though this is one of the tallest buildings in the world because of the tumbling and the light weight, there's so much air resistance that the penny never really gathers that much speed before it hits its terminal velocity. A gram of weight traveling at a relatively slow speed might hurt a little if it hit you on the head, but it's not going to kill you. The grain of truth embedded in this urban legend is the fact that falling objects -- even ones that seem harmless -- can do a lot of damage. That's why people on construction sites wear hard hats. If a big nut or bolt weighing 50 grams (about 1.8 ounces) falls and hits you on the head, it's going to do some serious damage, and depending on the height it falls from, it could definitely kill you if it hit right on top of your skull. To get an idea of the damage it can do, let's take a look at a bullet. A bullet might weigh 5 to 10 grams, and it leaves the barrel of a gun at anywhere from 800 to 2,000 miles per hour, depending on the type of gun, the type of bullet and the amount of powder behind the bullet. A 44-caliber bullet weighs about 9 grams. Let's assume it leaves the gun at 1,000 miles per hour. That gives it a muzzle energy of about 300 foot-pounds (1 foot-pound is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 pound 1 foot in the air). Three-hundred foot-pounds of energy is clearly enough to kill someone. Even a third of that is enough to kill someone. A 1-gram penny falling from the Empire State Building might reach 100 miles per hour. It has a little less than 1 foot-pound of energy when it hits, and just hurts a little. If a 50-gram nut, or a roll of pennies weighing 50 grams, were to fall from the Empire State Building, it would fall about 1,000 feet. Ignoring air resistance, it would reach a velocity of about 250 miles per hour. That gives it energy of about 100 foot-pounds, which is fatal if it hits you on the head. If you're wearing a hard hat, however, you'll survive.

But is there any truth to this notion? It's a question that merges urban legend with physics, legality, and public safety. In this article, we'll unpack the supposedly lethal penny's science, explore real-life experiments and studies, and discuss the legal and safety considerations of dropping any object from such heights. As we delve into this topic, we'll uncover what happens if someone drops a penny off the Empire State Building. The perception that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could be lethal is based on the idea that an object falling from such a height would accumulate extraordinary speed, making it deadly upon impact. However, this idea doesn't hold up when we consider the principles of physics, specifically the interplay between gravity, terminal velocity, and the specific characteristics of the penny itself. When any object is dropped from a height, it initially starts with a speed of zero, then accelerates downwards due to the force of gravity. Without air resistance, all objects, irrespective of their mass, would continue accelerating at around 9.8 m/s\u00b2 until they hit the ground. However, our world is filled with air, which drastically changes the picture. The penny, as it falls, collides with air molecules. These collisions create a drag force that opposes the penny's downward motion. As the penny picks up speed, the drag force increases until it equals the force of gravity acting on the penny. At this point, the penny no longer accelerates and continues to fall at a constant speed called terminal velocity. The terminal velocity of an object depends on its shape and mass. For a small, flat object like a penny, the terminal velocity is quite low due to the relatively large surface area encountering air resistance compared to its weight. Estimates put the terminal velocity of a penny at around 50 miles per hour. Therefore, if you were to drop a penny from the Empire State Building (or any other height beyond which it could reach its terminal velocity), it would hit the ground at its terminal velocity, not at speed proportional to the height it was dropped from. At around 50 miles per hour, it might sting, but it wouldn't cause serious injury. Additionally, the design of skyscrapers often causes updrafts, which could cause the penny to be blown off course, potentially even causing it to end up higher than the starting point. In conclusion, dropping a penny from the Empire State Building is unlikely to cause damage due to its terminal velocity. However, it's still not advised because it can be a nuisance or distraction, which can be hazardous in a bustling city like New York. Contrary to popular urban legend, a penny falling from the Empire State Building or any other skyscraper won't kill a pedestrian on the ground. This myth has been propagated through various means, from casual conversations to being stated as fact in movies and television shows. In reality, physics doesn't support this claim. When an object falls through the atmosphere, two primary forces are acting on it: gravity, which pulls it downward, and air resistance, which opposes its downward motion. For a penny, its flat, thin, and lightweight characteristics contribute to a low terminal velocity \u2014 the highest speed it can achieve when falling. As mentioned, this terminal velocity is estimated to be around 50 miles per hour. A penny might sting if it hit you at this speed, but it would hardly be lethal. Several physicists and science TV shows like MythBusters have debunked this myth through calculations and practical experiments. Their findings demonstrate that even after falling from a great height like the Empire State Building, the penny would not have enough energy to inflict severe harm or cause death. However, it's important to note that while the penny itself isn't dangerous, dropping any object from a tall building can be. Even a harmless penny can startle or distract someone, potentially leading to hazardous situations in a busy city environment. In summary, while a penny dropped from the Empire State Building won't kill you, keeping all objects, no matter how small or seemingly harmless, from free-falling off tall structures is best. Not because of the potential physical harm they could inflict but due to the potential for distraction and surprise they could cause in the bustling city life below. Over the years, numerous individuals and organizations have tested the lethal penny myth in real-life scenarios to debunk it. Here are a few notable experiments and studies conducted: MythBusters: In one of their episodes, the MythBusters team recreated the scenario by dropping a penny from a height equivalent to that of the Empire State Building. Using a wind tunnel and a high-speed camera, they determined that a penny reaches its terminal velocity of about 50 miles per hour. When they fired a penny at this speed into a skull analog, it bounced off, debunking the myth that a penny dropped from a great height could kill a pedestrian. Scientific American: Similarly, Scientific American conducted a theoretical study. They, too, concluded that the terminal velocity\n\nquestion: How much does a penny weigh?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1107}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Purdue University Study: Physicist Louis Bloomfield from the University of Virginia experimented and found that the maximum speed a penny could reach was 30 to 50 miles per hour - not nearly fast enough to kill or seriously injure anyone. Bloomfield further explained that the penny's shape and mass prevent it from becoming a deadly projectile. Each of these experiments concluded that contrary to popular belief, a penny dropped from the height of the Empire State Building is not deadly. While it's not advised (or legal) to throw objects from tall buildings due to potential unintended consequences, fears of lethal pennies can be laid to rest. So what would happen if someone dropped a penny from the top of the Empire State Building? Simply put, it would fall to the ground, but it wouldn't cause the catastrophic damage popular myth might have you believe. As we've established, a penny can only reach a terminal velocity of around 50 miles per hour due to its shape and mass. When it eventually hits the ground, or perhaps an unfortunate passerby, it wouldn't travel fast enough to cause serious harm. At most, getting hit by such a penny might feel like being flicked, not pleasant by any means, but far from deadly. Additionally, the urban environment surrounding the Empire State Building would influence the coin's descent. The wind could carry the penny off course, and the various skyscrapers could act as barriers. It's also worth noting that the Empire State Building observation decks are enclosed by tall fences specifically designed to prevent objects from being dropped. So, while it's an intriguing thought experiment, the reality is relatively mundane and much safer. The danger of a penny dropped from the Empire State Building is an enduring urban myth. A penny dropped from the Empire State Building can cause serious harm, so it's crucial to highlight the importance of safety and legality. Regardless of the physics involved, throwing objects off tall buildings is dangerous and illegal. While a penny may not have the capacity to kill, it could startle pedestrians, possibly causing accidents or triggering panic. Objects with more mass or aerodynamic shape can become lethal projectiles when dropped from significant heights. Legally, dropping objects from tall buildings like the Empire State Building is considered reckless endangerment and is punishable by law. The exact consequences can vary, but they may include hefty fines, imprisonment, or both. This rule isn't limited to just coins but applies to any objects that could harm individuals or property. Moreover, buildings like the Empire State Building have strict safety regulations, including protective barriers around observation decks to prevent such incidents.

It was a common piece of information that was spread across the playground. It is such a common urban legend that most of my other informants and I, too, have heard the same declaration. From when she was younger, her general understanding is that when dropped from the top balcony of the Empire State Building, the penny will gradually increase in velocity. As it gets closer to the ground, it will reach the speed of a bullet. If by chance the penny strikes a person in the head, the penny will go straight through and kill the person. She also says that there are variations of the legend: it will put a hole in the cement sidewalk, the coin will break to pieces, and even, that it has been used to purposefully kill someone. She laughed when she said the last variant saying: \u201cI have no idea how or why someone would strategically plan to kill someone with a penny\u2026 on the top of the Empire State Building. You wouldn\u2019t even be able to identify the right person from that high up!  \u2026I don\u2019t know, it was just something I heard from grade school.\u201d My informant told me that she remembered this \u201cfact\u201d so well that when she actually went to New York when she was in high school, she asked one of the tour guides if it had ever happened: \u201cThe guide told me that he got that one a lot, but he reassured me that it wasn\u2019t even possible. Supposedly, since the building is so tall, the updraft will slow the penny\u2019s speed as it falls and won\u2019t cause any damage. He also said, though, that people have thrown pennies off the side in the past, but they end up landing on other terraces on the lower floors.\u201d After hearing this, I was curious and did a little more research. After checking a few different sources, it turns out the urban legend is in fact completely false. According to the book Empire State Building, a penny tossed from the top of the Empire State Building will never even hit the ground. The updraft effect pushes falling objects against the building and end up falling only a few stories below. The coins that are dropped from the 86th floor simply land on the 80th floor and are collected by electricians when they change the lights on the outer side of the building. Furthermore, according to an experiment that was performed for the ABC show \u201c20/20,\u201d even if the pennies dodge the 80th floor landing, the pennies are still harmless to pedestrians below. After sending a large weather balloon into the air with an attached penny dispenser, Louis Bloomberg \u2013 a University of Virginia physics professor \u2013 spit the pennies one by one through a remote control device. Several pennies hit Bloomberg but \u201cit was like getting hit by a bug\u2026it was noticeable, but nothing more\u2026these things are just fluttering down.\u201d Another experiment was performed on the show \u201cMythbusters\u201d that tested the degree of impact at terminal velocity (the speed at which the penny would fall if no other factors such as friction acted upon the coin) on asphalt, cement, concrete and an anatomically correct human head replica. The experiment revealed that the penny would not penetrate any surfaces. As far as the human skull, a penny at terminal velocity may break the skin, but will not break through or fracture the skull.

Hopefully, any worries one might have of being killed by a falling penny as they stroll by tall buildings in New York will be quelled. After all, people are usually not injured by hail falling from the clouds. We will apply Newton's laws of motion to two cases. At first we will neglect air resistance (drag) so we can solve the problem analytically. Then we will use a simple model of drag to show how the penny reaches a terminal velocity and how this dramatically affects the impact velocity of the penny on the ground. When the only force acting on a body as it falls toward another body, similar to an apple falling to the Earth, is gravity then we say the body is in free fall. The only way we can do this is if we neglet things like drag caused by the atmosphere, wind or variations in The Gravitational Field. This situation is depicted in Figure 1, where the force due to gravity is F = \u2212 m g {\\displaystyle F=-mg} \\includegraphics{FreeFallAcceleration.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 1:} Penny falling from Empire State Building The two things we want to calculate is the velocity of the penny when it impacts the ground and the time it takes the penny to fall. Applying Newton's second law to the penny F = m a {\\displaystyle F=ma} yields the acceleration of the penny in the y direction a ( t ) = F m = \u2212 m g m = \u2212 g. {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {F}{m}}=-{\\frac {mg}{m}}=-g\\,.} Notice that the minus sign comes from the coordinate system choice with the y axis pointing up. Next, integrate the acceleration equation to get the velocity of the penny at a given time. Remember that the acceleration is defined as a = d v d t. {\\displaystyle a={\\frac {dv}{dt}}.} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d v = \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=-\\int gdt.} Integrate to get v ( t ) = \u2212 g t + C. {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt+C.} The constant is found using initial conditions, so at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, the velocity of the penny is zero v ( 0 ) = 0 = \u2212 g ( 0 ) + C. {\\displaystyle v(0)=0=-g(0)+C.} This is only true if C is also zero, therefore the velocity equation is v ( t ) = \u2212 g t {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt} Well, this is great, we can find the velocity at any given time. However, we do not know the time of the impact. For this we must integrate (1) to get the position of the penny. Remember, that velocity is defined as v = d x d t {\\displaystyle v={\\frac {dx}{dt}}} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d x = \u2212 \u222b g t d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dx=-\\int gtdt.} Integrate to get x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + C. {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+C.} Once again, the constant is found from the initial condition, at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, x ( 0 ) = h {\\displaystyle x(0)=h}. Therefore, the position equation is x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + h {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+h} What we want is the time of impact. This happens when x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0}. So solve (2) for t {\\displaystyle t}. 0 = \u2212 1 2 g t f 2 + h. {\\displaystyle 0=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt_{f}^{2}+h.} Rearrange to get t f = 2 h g {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {2h}{g}}}} Evaluate (3), using the value g = 9.8 {\\displaystyle g=9.8}, to get t f = ( 2 ) \u2217 ( 381 ) 9.8 {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {(2)*(381)}{9.8}}}} t f = 8.82 . {\\displaystyle t_{f}=8.82\\,\\,.} Finally, we get the velocity at impact by substituting (3) into (1) v ( t f ) = \u2212 g 2 h g. {\\displaystyle v(t_{f})=-g{\\sqrt {\\\n\nquestion: How much does a penny weigh?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1113}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the next section we will model air resistance to capture this effect. Since the penny is traveling through the atmosphere (a fluid), we need to use some basic results from fluid mechanics to model the drag force acting on the penny. A simple model combined with experimental data results in the drag expression F d = 1 2 C d \u03c1 A v 2 {\\displaystyle F_{d}={\\frac {1}{2}}C_{d}\\rho Av^{2}} where C d {\\displaystyle C_{d}} is the drag coefficient of the penny. It is an experimantly derived value and here we will use the value given by, C d = 1.17. {\\displaystyle C_{d}=1.17.} The drag force is in the opposite direction of the velocity vector as shown in the free body diagram in Figure 2. \\includegraphics{FreeBodyDiagram.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 2:} Free Body Diagram The density we will use is the standard day value at sea level given in the tables from, \u03c1 = 1.225  {\\displaystyle \\rho =1.225\\,\\,} Next A {\\displaystyle A}, is the effective cross-sectional area of the penny, From Wikipedia, the diameter of the US penny is D = 19.05  = 1.905 \u00d7 10 \u2212 2  {\\displaystyle D=19.05\\,\\,=1.905\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\,} So the cross-sectional area is then A = \u03c0 r 2 = \u03c0 D 2 4 = 0.000286 m 2 {\\displaystyle A=\\pi r^{2}=\\pi {\\frac {D^{2}}{4}}=0.000286m^{2}} Combining all these constants gives us the drag force that is proportional to the square of the velocity F d = 0.0002 v 2. {\\displaystyle F_{d}=0.0002v^{2}.} Now we have 2 forces to use with Newton's second law, this gives the acceleration equation as a ( t ) = 0.0002 v 2 m \u2212 g {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}-g} The integral setup is then \u222b d v = \u222b 0.0002 v 2 m d t \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=\\int {\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}dt-\\int gdt.} Unlike the free fall example, the analytical solution is a litte more difficult. However, all is not lost. We will first turn to numerical methods such as Euler's method or numerical programs such as Matlab, Octave or Maple and then later compare with analytical solution (coming soon). Here we will solve the differential equation using Octave. First a little setup must be done to use Octave's lsode solver. The differential equation of motion that we will solve with the mass of the penny, m = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3  {\\displaystyle m=2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\,}  d 2 x d t 2 = 0.0817 ( d x d t ) 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}}=0.0817\\left({\\frac {dx}{dt}}\\right)^{2}-9.8} We cannot use a 2nd order differential equation in lsode, so we must use two 1st order equations. This is done by using two states, one for position and another for velocity. Then our equations of motion become y \u02d9 = y \u02d9 {\\displaystyle {\\dot {y}}={\\dot {y}}} y \u00a8 = 0.0817 y \u02d9 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\ddot {y}}=0.0817{\\dot {y}}^{2}-9.8} The commands in octave are t = lines\n\nquestion: How much does a penny weigh?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1121}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the story, the penny falls and kills a pedestrian on the sidewalk below. This is one of those classic urban legends that is untrue but contains a grain of truth. Advertisement Throwing a penny off the Empire State Building wouldn't kill someone. A penny only weighs about a gram and it tumbles as it falls. Even though this is one of the tallest buildings in the world because of the tumbling and the light weight, there's so much air resistance that the penny never really gathers that much speed before it hits its terminal velocity. A gram of weight traveling at a relatively slow speed might hurt a little if it hit you on the head, but it's not going to kill you. The grain of truth embedded in this urban legend is the fact that falling objects -- even ones that seem harmless -- can do a lot of damage. That's why people on construction sites wear hard hats. If a big nut or bolt weighing 50 grams (about 1.8 ounces) falls and hits you on the head, it's going to do some serious damage, and depending on the height it falls from, it could definitely kill you if it hit right on top of your skull. To get an idea of the damage it can do, let's take a look at a bullet. A bullet might weigh 5 to 10 grams, and it leaves the barrel of a gun at anywhere from 800 to 2,000 miles per hour, depending on the type of gun, the type of bullet and the amount of powder behind the bullet. A 44-caliber bullet weighs about 9 grams. Let's assume it leaves the gun at 1,000 miles per hour. That gives it a muzzle energy of about 300 foot-pounds (1 foot-pound is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 pound 1 foot in the air). Three-hundred foot-pounds of energy is clearly enough to kill someone. Even a third of that is enough to kill someone. A 1-gram penny falling from the Empire State Building might reach 100 miles per hour. It has a little less than 1 foot-pound of energy when it hits, and just hurts a little. If a 50-gram nut, or a roll of pennies weighing 50 grams, were to fall from the Empire State Building, it would fall about 1,000 feet. Ignoring air resistance, it would reach a velocity of about 250 miles per hour. That gives it energy of about 100 foot-pounds, which is fatal if it hits you on the head. If you're wearing a hard hat, however, you'll survive.

But is there any truth to this notion? It's a question that merges urban legend with physics, legality, and public safety. In this article, we'll unpack the supposedly lethal penny's science, explore real-life experiments and studies, and discuss the legal and safety considerations of dropping any object from such heights. As we delve into this topic, we'll uncover what happens if someone drops a penny off the Empire State Building. The perception that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could be lethal is based on the idea that an object falling from such a height would accumulate extraordinary speed, making it deadly upon impact. However, this idea doesn't hold up when we consider the principles of physics, specifically the interplay between gravity, terminal velocity, and the specific characteristics of the penny itself. When any object is dropped from a height, it initially starts with a speed of zero, then accelerates downwards due to the force of gravity. Without air resistance, all objects, irrespective of their mass, would continue accelerating at around 9.8 m/s\u00b2 until they hit the ground. However, our world is filled with air, which drastically changes the picture. The penny, as it falls, collides with air molecules. These collisions create a drag force that opposes the penny's downward motion. As the penny picks up speed, the drag force increases until it equals the force of gravity acting on the penny. At this point, the penny no longer accelerates and continues to fall at a constant speed called terminal velocity. The terminal velocity of an object depends on its shape and mass. For a small, flat object like a penny, the terminal velocity is quite low due to the relatively large surface area encountering air resistance compared to its weight. Estimates put the terminal velocity of a penny at around 50 miles per hour. Therefore, if you were to drop a penny from the Empire State Building (or any other height beyond which it could reach its terminal velocity), it would hit the ground at its terminal velocity, not at speed proportional to the height it was dropped from. At around 50 miles per hour, it might sting, but it wouldn't cause serious injury. Additionally, the design of skyscrapers often causes updrafts, which could cause the penny to be blown off course, potentially even causing it to end up higher than the starting point. In conclusion, dropping a penny from the Empire State Building is unlikely to cause damage due to its terminal velocity. However, it's still not advised because it can be a nuisance or distraction, which can be hazardous in a bustling city like New York. Contrary to popular urban legend, a penny falling from the Empire State Building or any other skyscraper won't kill a pedestrian on the ground. This myth has been propagated through various means, from casual conversations to being stated as fact in movies and television shows. In reality, physics doesn't support this claim. When an object falls through the atmosphere, two primary forces are acting on it: gravity, which pulls it downward, and air resistance, which opposes its downward motion. For a penny, its flat, thin, and lightweight characteristics contribute to a low terminal velocity \u2014 the highest speed it can achieve when falling. As mentioned, this terminal velocity is estimated to be around 50 miles per hour. A penny might sting if it hit you at this speed, but it would hardly be lethal. Several physicists and science TV shows like MythBusters have debunked this myth through calculations and practical experiments. Their findings demonstrate that even after falling from a great height like the Empire State Building, the penny would not have enough energy to inflict severe harm or cause death. However, it's important to note that while the penny itself isn't dangerous, dropping any object from a tall building can be. Even a harmless penny can startle or distract someone, potentially leading to hazardous situations in a busy city environment. In summary, while a penny dropped from the Empire State Building won't kill you, keeping all objects, no matter how small or seemingly harmless, from free-falling off tall structures is best. Not because of the potential physical harm they could inflict but due to the potential for distraction and surprise they could cause in the bustling city life below. Over the years, numerous individuals and organizations have tested the lethal penny myth in real-life scenarios to debunk it. Here are a few notable experiments and studies conducted: MythBusters: In one of their episodes, the MythBusters team recreated the scenario by dropping a penny from a height equivalent to that of the Empire State Building. Using a wind tunnel and a high-speed camera, they determined that a penny reaches its terminal velocity of about 50 miles per hour. When they fired a penny at this speed into a skull analog, it bounced off, debunking the myth that a penny dropped from a great height could kill a pedestrian.

Purdue University Study: Physicist Louis Bloomfield from the University of Virginia experimented and found that the maximum speed a penny could reach was 30 to 50 miles per hour - not nearly fast enough to kill or seriously injure anyone. Bloomfield further explained that the penny's shape and mass prevent it from becoming a deadly projectile. Each of these experiments concluded that contrary to popular belief, a penny dropped from the height of the Empire State Building is not deadly. While it's not advised (or legal) to throw objects from tall buildings due to potential unintended consequences, fears of lethal pennies can be laid to rest. So what would happen if someone dropped a penny from the top of the Empire State Building? Simply put, it would fall to the ground, but it wouldn't cause the catastrophic damage popular myth might have you believe. As we've established, a penny can only reach a terminal velocity of around 50 miles per hour due to its shape and mass. When it eventually hits the ground, or perhaps an unfortunate passerby, it wouldn't travel fast enough to cause serious harm. At most, getting hit by such a penny might feel like being flicked, not pleasant by any means, but far from deadly. Additionally, the urban environment surrounding the Empire State Building would influence the coin's descent. The wind could carry the penny off course, and the various skyscrapers could act as barriers. It's also worth noting that the Empire State Building observation decks are enclosed by tall fences specifically designed to prevent objects from being dropped. So, while it's an intriguing thought experiment, the reality is relatively mundane and much safer. The danger of a penny dropped from the Empire State Building is an enduring urban myth. A penny dropped from the Empire State Building can cause serious harm, so it's crucial to highlight the importance of safety and legality. Regardless of the physics involved, throwing objects off tall buildings is dangerous and illegal. While a penny may not have the capacity to kill, it could startle pedestrians, possibly causing accidents or triggering panic. Objects with more mass or aerodynamic shape can become lethal projectiles when dropped from significant heights. Legally, dropping objects from tall buildings like the Empire State Building is considered reckless endangerment and is punishable by law. The exact consequences can vary, but they may include hefty fines, imprisonment, or both. This rule isn't limited to just coins but applies to any objects that could harm individuals or property. Moreover, buildings like the Empire State Building have strict safety regulations, including protective barriers around observation decks to prevent such incidents.

It was a common piece of information that was spread across the playground. It is such a common urban legend that most of my other informants and I, too, have heard the same declaration. From when she was younger, her general understanding is that when dropped from the top balcony of the Empire State Building, the penny will gradually increase in velocity. As it gets closer to the ground, it will reach the speed of a bullet. If by chance the penny strikes a person in the head, the penny will go straight through and kill the person. She also says that there are variations of the legend: it will put a hole in the cement sidewalk, the coin will break to pieces, and even, that it has been used to purposefully kill someone. She laughed when she said the last variant saying: \u201cI have no idea how or why someone would strategically plan to kill someone with a penny\u2026 on the top of the Empire State Building. You wouldn\u2019t even be able to identify the right person from that high up!  \u2026I don\u2019t know, it was just something I heard from grade school.\u201d My informant told me that she remembered this \u201cfact\u201d so well that when she actually went to New York when she was in high school, she asked one of the tour guides if it had ever happened: \u201cThe guide told me that he got that one a lot, but he reassured me that it wasn\u2019t even possible. Supposedly, since the building is so tall, the updraft will slow the penny\u2019s speed as it falls and won\u2019t cause any damage. He also said, though, that people have thrown pennies off the side in the past, but they end up landing on other terraces on the lower floors.\u201d After hearing this, I was curious and did a little more research. After checking a few different sources, it turns out the urban legend is in fact completely false. According to the book Empire State Building, a penny tossed from the top of the Empire State Building will never even hit the ground. The updraft effect pushes falling objects against the building and end up falling only a few stories below. The coins that are dropped from the 86th floor simply land on the 80th floor and are collected by electricians when they change the lights on the outer side of the building. Furthermore, according to an experiment that was performed for the ABC show \u201c20/20,\u201d even if the pennies dodge the 80th floor landing, the pennies are still harmless to pedestrians below. After sending a large weather balloon into the air with an attached penny dispenser, Louis Bloomberg \u2013 a University of Virginia physics professor \u2013 spit the pennies one by one through a remote control device. Several pennies hit Bloomberg but \u201cit was like getting hit by a bug\u2026it was noticeable, but nothing more\u2026these things are just fluttering down.\u201d Another experiment was performed on the show \u201cMythbusters\u201d that tested the degree of impact at terminal velocity (the speed at which the penny would fall if no other factors such as friction acted upon the coin) on asphalt, cement, concrete and an anatomically correct human head replica. The experiment revealed that the penny would not penetrate any surfaces. As far as the human skull, a penny at terminal velocity may break the skin, but will not break through or fracture the skull. So as the crew of Mythbusters would say, this urban legend is \u201cbusted!\u201d Hyneman, Jamie, and Adam Savage. \u201cMythbusters: Penny Drop MiniMyth.\u201d Mythbusters.

Hopefully, any worries one might have of being killed by a falling penny as they stroll by tall buildings in New York will be quelled. After all, people are usually not injured by hail falling from the clouds. We will apply Newton's laws of motion to two cases. At first we will neglect air resistance (drag) so we can solve the problem analytically. Then we will use a simple model of drag to show how the penny reaches a terminal velocity and how this dramatically affects the impact velocity of the penny on the ground. When the only force acting on a body as it falls toward another body, similar to an apple falling to the Earth, is gravity then we say the body is in free fall. The only way we can do this is if we neglet things like drag caused by the atmosphere, wind or variations in The Gravitational Field. This situation is depicted in Figure 1, where the force due to gravity is F = \u2212 m g {\\displaystyle F=-mg} \\includegraphics{FreeFallAcceleration.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 1:} Penny falling from Empire State Building The two things we want to calculate is the velocity of the penny when it impacts the ground and the time it takes the penny to fall. Applying Newton's second law to the penny F = m a {\\displaystyle F=ma} yields the acceleration of the penny in the y direction a ( t ) = F m = \u2212 m g m = \u2212 g. {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {F}{m}}=-{\\frac {mg}{m}}=-g\\,.} Notice that the minus sign comes from the coordinate system choice with the y axis pointing up. Next, integrate the acceleration equation to get the velocity of the penny at a given time. Remember that the acceleration is defined as a = d v d t. {\\displaystyle a={\\frac {dv}{dt}}.} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d v = \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=-\\int gdt.} Integrate to get v ( t ) = \u2212 g t + C. {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt+C.} The constant is found using initial conditions, so at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, the velocity of the penny is zero v ( 0 ) = 0 = \u2212 g ( 0 ) + C. {\\displaystyle v(0)=0=-g(0)+C.} This is only true if C is also zero, therefore the velocity equation is v ( t ) = \u2212 g t {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt} Well, this is great, we can find the velocity at any given time. However, we do not know the time of the impact. For this we must integrate (1) to get the position of the penny. Remember, that velocity is defined as v = d x d t {\\displaystyle v={\\frac {dx}{dt}}} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d x = \u2212 \u222b g t d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dx=-\\int gtdt.} Integrate to get x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + C. {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+C.} Once again, the constant is found from the initial condition, at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, x ( 0 ) = h {\\displaystyle x(0)=h}. Therefore, the position equation is x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + h {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+h} What we want is the time of impact. This happens when x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0}. So solve (2) for t {\\displaystyle t}. 0 = \u2212 1 2 g t f 2 + h. {\\displaystyle 0=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt_{f}^{2}+h.} Rearrange to get t f = 2 h g {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {2h}{g}}}} Evaluate (3), using the value g = 9.8 {\\displaystyle g=9.8}, to get t f = ( 2 ) \u2217 ( 381 ) 9.8 {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {(2)*(381)}{9.8}}}} t f = 8.82 . {\\displaystyle t_{f}=8.82\\,\\,.} Finally, we get the velocity at impact by substituting (3) into (1) v ( t f ) = \u2212 g 2 h g. {\\displaystyle v(t_{f})=-g{\\sqrt {\\\n\nquestion: At what speed might a 1-gram penny falling from the Empire State Building reach?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1124}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the next section we will model air resistance to capture this effect. Since the penny is traveling through the atmosphere (a fluid), we need to use some basic results from fluid mechanics to model the drag force acting on the penny. A simple model combined with experimental data results in the drag expression F d = 1 2 C d \u03c1 A v 2 {\\displaystyle F_{d}={\\frac {1}{2}}C_{d}\\rho Av^{2}} where C d {\\displaystyle C_{d}} is the drag coefficient of the penny. It is an experimantly derived value and here we will use the value given by, C d = 1.17. {\\displaystyle C_{d}=1.17.} The drag force is in the opposite direction of the velocity vector as shown in the free body diagram in Figure 2. \\includegraphics{FreeBodyDiagram.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 2:} Free Body Diagram The density we will use is the standard day value at sea level given in the tables from, \u03c1 = 1.225  {\\displaystyle \\rho =1.225\\,\\,} Next A {\\displaystyle A}, is the effective cross-sectional area of the penny, From Wikipedia, the diameter of the US penny is D = 19.05  = 1.905 \u00d7 10 \u2212 2  {\\displaystyle D=19.05\\,\\,=1.905\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\,} So the cross-sectional area is then A = \u03c0 r 2 = \u03c0 D 2 4 = 0.000286 m 2 {\\displaystyle A=\\pi r^{2}=\\pi {\\frac {D^{2}}{4}}=0.000286m^{2}} Combining all these constants gives us the drag force that is proportional to the square of the velocity F d = 0.0002 v 2. {\\displaystyle F_{d}=0.0002v^{2}.} Now we have 2 forces to use with Newton's second law, this gives the acceleration equation as a ( t ) = 0.0002 v 2 m \u2212 g {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}-g} The integral setup is then \u222b d v = \u222b 0.0002 v 2 m d t \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=\\int {\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}dt-\\int gdt.} Unlike the free fall example, the analytical solution is a litte more difficult. However, all is not lost. We will first turn to numerical methods such as Euler's method or numerical programs such as Matlab, Octave or Maple and then later compare with analytical solution (coming soon). Here we will solve the differential equation using Octave. First a little setup must be done to use Octave's lsode solver. The differential equation of motion that we will solve with the mass of the penny, m = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3  {\\displaystyle m=2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\,}  d 2 x d t 2 = 0.0817 ( d x d t ) 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}}=0.0817\\left({\\frac {dx}{dt}}\\right)^{2}-9.8} We cannot use a 2nd order differential equation in lsode, so we must use two 1st order equations. This is done by using two states, one for position and another for velocity. Then our equations of motion become y \u02d9 = y \u02d9 {\\displaystyle {\\dot {y}}={\\dot {y}}} y \u00a8 = 0.0817 y \u02d9 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\ddot {y}}=0.0817{\\dot {y}}^{2}-9.8} The commands in octave are t = lines\n\nquestion: At what speed might a 1-gram penny falling from the Empire State Building reach?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "-86.42", "usage": 1134}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the story, the penny falls and kills a pedestrian on the sidewalk below. This is one of those classic urban legends that is untrue but contains a grain of truth. Advertisement Throwing a penny off the Empire State Building wouldn't kill someone. A penny only weighs about a gram and it tumbles as it falls. Even though this is one of the tallest buildings in the world because of the tumbling and the light weight, there's so much air resistance that the penny never really gathers that much speed before it hits its terminal velocity. A gram of weight traveling at a relatively slow speed might hurt a little if it hit you on the head, but it's not going to kill you. The grain of truth embedded in this urban legend is the fact that falling objects -- even ones that seem harmless -- can do a lot of damage. That's why people on construction sites wear hard hats. If a big nut or bolt weighing 50 grams (about 1.8 ounces) falls and hits you on the head, it's going to do some serious damage, and depending on the height it falls from, it could definitely kill you if it hit right on top of your skull. To get an idea of the damage it can do, let's take a look at a bullet. A bullet might weigh 5 to 10 grams, and it leaves the barrel of a gun at anywhere from 800 to 2,000 miles per hour, depending on the type of gun, the type of bullet and the amount of powder behind the bullet. A 44-caliber bullet weighs about 9 grams. Let's assume it leaves the gun at 1,000 miles per hour. That gives it a muzzle energy of about 300 foot-pounds (1 foot-pound is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 pound 1 foot in the air). Three-hundred foot-pounds of energy is clearly enough to kill someone. Even a third of that is enough to kill someone. A 1-gram penny falling from the Empire State Building might reach 100 miles per hour. It has a little less than 1 foot-pound of energy when it hits, and just hurts a little. If a 50-gram nut, or a roll of pennies weighing 50 grams, were to fall from the Empire State Building, it would fall about 1,000 feet. Ignoring air resistance, it would reach a velocity of about 250 miles per hour. That gives it energy of about 100 foot-pounds, which is fatal if it hits you on the head. If you're wearing a hard hat, however, you'll survive.

But is there any truth to this notion? It's a question that merges urban legend with physics, legality, and public safety. In this article, we'll unpack the supposedly lethal penny's science, explore real-life experiments and studies, and discuss the legal and safety considerations of dropping any object from such heights. As we delve into this topic, we'll uncover what happens if someone drops a penny off the Empire State Building. The perception that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could be lethal is based on the idea that an object falling from such a height would accumulate extraordinary speed, making it deadly upon impact. However, this idea doesn't hold up when we consider the principles of physics, specifically the interplay between gravity, terminal velocity, and the specific characteristics of the penny itself. When any object is dropped from a height, it initially starts with a speed of zero, then accelerates downwards due to the force of gravity. Without air resistance, all objects, irrespective of their mass, would continue accelerating at around 9.8 m/s\u00b2 until they hit the ground. However, our world is filled with air, which drastically changes the picture. The penny, as it falls, collides with air molecules. These collisions create a drag force that opposes the penny's downward motion. As the penny picks up speed, the drag force increases until it equals the force of gravity acting on the penny. At this point, the penny no longer accelerates and continues to fall at a constant speed called terminal velocity. The terminal velocity of an object depends on its shape and mass. For a small, flat object like a penny, the terminal velocity is quite low due to the relatively large surface area encountering air resistance compared to its weight. Estimates put the terminal velocity of a penny at around 50 miles per hour. Therefore, if you were to drop a penny from the Empire State Building (or any other height beyond which it could reach its terminal velocity), it would hit the ground at its terminal velocity, not at speed proportional to the height it was dropped from. At around 50 miles per hour, it might sting, but it wouldn't cause serious injury. Additionally, the design of skyscrapers often causes updrafts, which could cause the penny to be blown off course, potentially even causing it to end up higher than the starting point. In conclusion, dropping a penny from the Empire State Building is unlikely to cause damage due to its terminal velocity. However, it's still not advised because it can be a nuisance or distraction, which can be hazardous in a bustling city like New York. Contrary to popular urban legend, a penny falling from the Empire State Building or any other skyscraper won't kill a pedestrian on the ground. This myth has been propagated through various means, from casual conversations to being stated as fact in movies and television shows. In reality, physics doesn't support this claim. When an object falls through the atmosphere, two primary forces are acting on it: gravity, which pulls it downward, and air resistance, which opposes its downward motion. For a penny, its flat, thin, and lightweight characteristics contribute to a low terminal velocity \u2014 the highest speed it can achieve when falling. As mentioned, this terminal velocity is estimated to be around 50 miles per hour. A penny might sting if it hit you at this speed, but it would hardly be lethal. Several physicists and science TV shows like MythBusters have debunked this myth through calculations and practical experiments. Their findings demonstrate that even after falling from a great height like the Empire State Building, the penny would not have enough energy to inflict severe harm or cause death. However, it's important to note that while the penny itself isn't dangerous, dropping any object from a tall building can be. Even a harmless penny can startle or distract someone, potentially leading to hazardous situations in a busy city environment. In summary, while a penny dropped from the Empire State Building won't kill you, keeping all objects, no matter how small or seemingly harmless, from free-falling off tall structures is best. Not because of the potential physical harm they could inflict but due to the potential for distraction and surprise they could cause in the bustling city life below. Over the years, numerous individuals and organizations have tested the lethal penny myth in real-life scenarios to debunk it. Here are a few notable experiments and studies conducted: MythBusters: In one of their episodes, the MythBusters team recreated the scenario by dropping a penny from a height equivalent to that of the Empire State Building.

So what would happen if someone dropped a penny from the top of the Empire State Building? Simply put, it would fall to the ground, but it wouldn't cause the catastrophic damage popular myth might have you believe. As we've established, a penny can only reach a terminal velocity of around 50 miles per hour due to its shape and mass. When it eventually hits the ground, or perhaps an unfortunate passerby, it wouldn't travel fast enough to cause serious harm. At most, getting hit by such a penny might feel like being flicked, not pleasant by any means, but far from deadly. Additionally, the urban environment surrounding the Empire State Building would influence the coin's descent. The wind could carry the penny off course, and the various skyscrapers could act as barriers. It's also worth noting that the Empire State Building observation decks are enclosed by tall fences specifically designed to prevent objects from being dropped. So, while it's an intriguing thought experiment, the reality is relatively mundane and much safer. The danger of a penny dropped from the Empire State Building is an enduring urban myth. A penny dropped from the Empire State Building can cause serious harm, so it's crucial to highlight the importance of safety and legality. Regardless of the physics involved, throwing objects off tall buildings is dangerous and illegal. While a penny may not have the capacity to kill, it could startle pedestrians, possibly causing accidents or triggering panic. Objects with more mass or aerodynamic shape can become lethal projectiles when dropped from significant heights. Legally, dropping objects from tall buildings like the Empire State Building is considered reckless endangerment and is punishable by law. The exact consequences can vary, but they may include hefty fines, imprisonment, or both. This rule isn't limited to just coins but applies to any objects that could harm individuals or property. Moreover, buildings like the Empire State Building have strict safety regulations, including protective barriers around observation decks to prevent such incidents.

It was a common piece of information that was spread across the playground. It is such a common urban legend that most of my other informants and I, too, have heard the same declaration. From when she was younger, her general understanding is that when dropped from the top balcony of the Empire State Building, the penny will gradually increase in velocity. As it gets closer to the ground, it will reach the speed of a bullet. If by chance the penny strikes a person in the head, the penny will go straight through and kill the person. She also says that there are variations of the legend: it will put a hole in the cement sidewalk, the coin will break to pieces, and even, that it has been used to purposefully kill someone. She laughed when she said the last variant saying: \u201cI have no idea how or why someone would strategically plan to kill someone with a penny\u2026 on the top of the Empire State Building. You wouldn\u2019t even be able to identify the right person from that high up!  \u2026I don\u2019t know, it was just something I heard from grade school.\u201d My informant told me that she remembered this \u201cfact\u201d so well that when she actually went to New York when she was in high school, she asked one of the tour guides if it had ever happened: \u201cThe guide told me that he got that one a lot, but he reassured me that it wasn\u2019t even possible. Supposedly, since the building is so tall, the updraft will slow the penny\u2019s speed as it falls and won\u2019t cause any damage. He also said, though, that people have thrown pennies off the side in the past, but they end up landing on other terraces on the lower floors.\u201d After hearing this, I was curious and did a little more research. After checking a few different sources, it turns out the urban legend is in fact completely false. According to the book Empire State Building, a penny tossed from the top of the Empire State Building will never even hit the ground. The updraft effect pushes falling objects against the building and end up falling only a few stories below. The coins that are dropped from the 86th floor simply land on the 80th floor and are collected by electricians when they change the lights on the outer side of the building. Furthermore, according to an experiment that was performed for the ABC show \u201c20/20,\u201d even if the pennies dodge the 80th floor landing, the pennies are still harmless to pedestrians below. After sending a large weather balloon into the air with an attached penny dispenser, Louis Bloomberg \u2013 a University of Virginia physics professor \u2013 spit the pennies one by one through a remote control device. Several pennies hit Bloomberg but \u201cit was like getting hit by a bug\u2026it was noticeable, but nothing more\u2026these things are just fluttering down.\u201d Another experiment was performed on the show \u201cMythbusters\u201d that tested the degree of impact at terminal velocity (the speed at which the penny would fall if no other factors such as friction acted upon the coin) on asphalt, cement, concrete and an anatomically correct human head replica. The experiment revealed that the penny would not penetrate any surfaces. As far as the human skull, a penny at terminal velocity may break the skin, but will not break through or fracture the skull. So as the crew of Mythbusters would say, this urban legend is \u201cbusted!\u201d Hyneman, Jamie, and Adam Savage. \u201cMythbusters: Penny Drop MiniMyth.\u201d Mythbusters.

Hopefully, any worries one might have of being killed by a falling penny as they stroll by tall buildings in New York will be quelled. After all, people are usually not injured by hail falling from the clouds. We will apply Newton's laws of motion to two cases. At first we will neglect air resistance (drag) so we can solve the problem analytically. Then we will use a simple model of drag to show how the penny reaches a terminal velocity and how this dramatically affects the impact velocity of the penny on the ground. When the only force acting on a body as it falls toward another body, similar to an apple falling to the Earth, is gravity then we say the body is in free fall. The only way we can do this is if we neglet things like drag caused by the atmosphere, wind or variations in The Gravitational Field. This situation is depicted in Figure 1, where the force due to gravity is F = \u2212 m g {\\displaystyle F=-mg} \\includegraphics{FreeFallAcceleration.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 1:} Penny falling from Empire State Building The two things we want to calculate is the velocity of the penny when it impacts the ground and the time it takes the penny to fall. Applying Newton's second law to the penny F = m a {\\displaystyle F=ma} yields the acceleration of the penny in the y direction a ( t ) = F m = \u2212 m g m = \u2212 g. {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {F}{m}}=-{\\frac {mg}{m}}=-g\\,.} Notice that the minus sign comes from the coordinate system choice with the y axis pointing up. Next, integrate the acceleration equation to get the velocity of the penny at a given time. Remember that the acceleration is defined as a = d v d t. {\\displaystyle a={\\frac {dv}{dt}}.} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d v = \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=-\\int gdt.} Integrate to get v ( t ) = \u2212 g t + C. {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt+C.} The constant is found using initial conditions, so at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, the velocity of the penny is zero v ( 0 ) = 0 = \u2212 g ( 0 ) + C. {\\displaystyle v(0)=0=-g(0)+C.} This is only true if C is also zero, therefore the velocity equation is v ( t ) = \u2212 g t {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt} Well, this is great, we can find the velocity at any given time. However, we do not know the time of the impact. For this we must integrate (1) to get the position of the penny. Remember, that velocity is defined as v = d x d t {\\displaystyle v={\\frac {dx}{dt}}} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d x = \u2212 \u222b g t d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dx=-\\int gtdt.} Integrate to get x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + C. {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+C.} Once again, the constant is found from the initial condition, at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, x ( 0 ) = h {\\displaystyle x(0)=h}. Therefore, the position equation is x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + h {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+h} What we want is the time of impact. This happens when x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0}. So solve (2) for t {\\displaystyle t}. 0 = \u2212 1 2 g t f 2 + h. {\\displaystyle 0=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt_{f}^{2}+h.} Rearrange to get t f = 2 h g {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {2h}{g}}}} Evaluate (3), using the value g = 9.8 {\\displaystyle g=9.8}, to get t f = ( 2 ) \u2217 ( 381 ) 9.8 {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {(2)*(381)}{9.8}}}} t f = 8.82 . {\\displaystyle t_{f}=8.82\\,\\,.} Finally, we get the velocity at impact by substituting (3) into (1) v ( t f ) = \u2212 g 2 h g. {\\displaystyle v(t_{f})=-g{\\sqrt {\\\n\nquestion: How much energy does a penny have when it hits the ground?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1119}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the next section we will model air resistance to capture this effect. Since the penny is traveling through the atmosphere (a fluid), we need to use some basic results from fluid mechanics to model the drag force acting on the penny. A simple model combined with experimental data results in the drag expression F d = 1 2 C d \u03c1 A v 2 {\\displaystyle F_{d}={\\frac {1}{2}}C_{d}\\rho Av^{2}} where C d {\\displaystyle C_{d}} is the drag coefficient of the penny. It is an experimantly derived value and here we will use the value given by, C d = 1.17. {\\displaystyle C_{d}=1.17.} The drag force is in the opposite direction of the velocity vector as shown in the free body diagram in Figure 2. \\includegraphics{FreeBodyDiagram.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 2:} Free Body Diagram The density we will use is the standard day value at sea level given in the tables from, \u03c1 = 1.225  {\\displaystyle \\rho =1.225\\,\\,} Next A {\\displaystyle A}, is the effective cross-sectional area of the penny, From Wikipedia, the diameter of the US penny is D = 19.05  = 1.905 \u00d7 10 \u2212 2  {\\displaystyle D=19.05\\,\\,=1.905\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\,} So the cross-sectional area is then A = \u03c0 r 2 = \u03c0 D 2 4 = 0.000286 m 2 {\\displaystyle A=\\pi r^{2}=\\pi {\\frac {D^{2}}{4}}=0.000286m^{2}} Combining all these constants gives us the drag force that is proportional to the square of the velocity F d = 0.0002 v 2. {\\displaystyle F_{d}=0.0002v^{2}.} Now we have 2 forces to use with Newton's second law, this gives the acceleration equation as a ( t ) = 0.0002 v 2 m \u2212 g {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}-g} The integral setup is then \u222b d v = \u222b 0.0002 v 2 m d t \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=\\int {\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}dt-\\int gdt.} Unlike the free fall example, the analytical solution is a litte more difficult. However, all is not lost. We will first turn to numerical methods such as Euler's method or numerical programs such as Matlab, Octave or Maple and then later compare with analytical solution (coming soon). Here we will solve the differential equation using Octave. First a little setup must be done to use Octave's lsode solver. The differential equation of motion that we will solve with the mass of the penny, m = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3  {\\displaystyle m=2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\,}  d 2 x d t 2 = 0.0817 ( d x d t ) 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}}=0.0817\\left({\\frac {dx}{dt}}\\right)^{2}-9.8} We cannot use a 2nd order differential equation in lsode, so we must use two 1st order equations. This is done by using two states, one for position and another for velocity. Then our equations of motion become y \u02d9 = y \u02d9 {\\displaystyle {\\dot {y}}={\\dot {y}}} y \u00a8 = 0.0817 y \u02d9 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\ddot {y}}=0.0817{\\dot {y}}^{2}-9.8} The commands in octave are t = lines\n\nquestion: How much energy does a penny have when it hits the ground?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1127}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the story, the penny falls and kills a pedestrian on the sidewalk below. This is one of those classic urban legends that is untrue but contains a grain of truth. Advertisement Throwing a penny off the Empire State Building wouldn't kill someone. A penny only weighs about a gram and it tumbles as it falls. Even though this is one of the tallest buildings in the world because of the tumbling and the light weight, there's so much air resistance that the penny never really gathers that much speed before it hits its terminal velocity. A gram of weight traveling at a relatively slow speed might hurt a little if it hit you on the head, but it's not going to kill you. The grain of truth embedded in this urban legend is the fact that falling objects -- even ones that seem harmless -- can do a lot of damage. That's why people on construction sites wear hard hats. If a big nut or bolt weighing 50 grams (about 1.8 ounces) falls and hits you on the head, it's going to do some serious damage, and depending on the height it falls from, it could definitely kill you if it hit right on top of your skull. To get an idea of the damage it can do, let's take a look at a bullet. A bullet might weigh 5 to 10 grams, and it leaves the barrel of a gun at anywhere from 800 to 2,000 miles per hour, depending on the type of gun, the type of bullet and the amount of powder behind the bullet. A 44-caliber bullet weighs about 9 grams. Let's assume it leaves the gun at 1,000 miles per hour. That gives it a muzzle energy of about 300 foot-pounds (1 foot-pound is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 pound 1 foot in the air). Three-hundred foot-pounds of energy is clearly enough to kill someone. Even a third of that is enough to kill someone. A 1-gram penny falling from the Empire State Building might reach 100 miles per hour. It has a little less than 1 foot-pound of energy when it hits, and just hurts a little. If a 50-gram nut, or a roll of pennies weighing 50 grams, were to fall from the Empire State Building, it would fall about 1,000 feet. Ignoring air resistance, it would reach a velocity of about 250 miles per hour. That gives it energy of about 100 foot-pounds, which is fatal if it hits you on the head. If you're wearing a hard hat, however, you'll survive.

But is there any truth to this notion? It's a question that merges urban legend with physics, legality, and public safety. In this article, we'll unpack the supposedly lethal penny's science, explore real-life experiments and studies, and discuss the legal and safety considerations of dropping any object from such heights. As we delve into this topic, we'll uncover what happens if someone drops a penny off the Empire State Building. The perception that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could be lethal is based on the idea that an object falling from such a height would accumulate extraordinary speed, making it deadly upon impact. However, this idea doesn't hold up when we consider the principles of physics, specifically the interplay between gravity, terminal velocity, and the specific characteristics of the penny itself. When any object is dropped from a height, it initially starts with a speed of zero, then accelerates downwards due to the force of gravity. Without air resistance, all objects, irrespective of their mass, would continue accelerating at around 9.8 m/s\u00b2 until they hit the ground. However, our world is filled with air, which drastically changes the picture. The penny, as it falls, collides with air molecules. These collisions create a drag force that opposes the penny's downward motion. As the penny picks up speed, the drag force increases until it equals the force of gravity acting on the penny. At this point, the penny no longer accelerates and continues to fall at a constant speed called terminal velocity. The terminal velocity of an object depends on its shape and mass. For a small, flat object like a penny, the terminal velocity is quite low due to the relatively large surface area encountering air resistance compared to its weight. Estimates put the terminal velocity of a penny at around 50 miles per hour. Therefore, if you were to drop a penny from the Empire State Building (or any other height beyond which it could reach its terminal velocity), it would hit the ground at its terminal velocity, not at speed proportional to the height it was dropped from. At around 50 miles per hour, it might sting, but it wouldn't cause serious injury. Additionally, the design of skyscrapers often causes updrafts, which could cause the penny to be blown off course, potentially even causing it to end up higher than the starting point. In conclusion, dropping a penny from the Empire State Building is unlikely to cause damage due to its terminal velocity. However, it's still not advised because it can be a nuisance or distraction, which can be hazardous in a bustling city like New York. Contrary to popular urban legend, a penny falling from the Empire State Building or any other skyscraper won't kill a pedestrian on the ground. This myth has been propagated through various means, from casual conversations to being stated as fact in movies and television shows. In reality, physics doesn't support this claim. When an object falls through the atmosphere, two primary forces are acting on it: gravity, which pulls it downward, and air resistance, which opposes its downward motion. For a penny, its flat, thin, and lightweight characteristics contribute to a low terminal velocity \u2014 the highest speed it can achieve when falling. As mentioned, this terminal velocity is estimated to be around 50 miles per hour. A penny might sting if it hit you at this speed, but it would hardly be lethal. Several physicists and science TV shows like MythBusters have debunked this myth through calculations and practical experiments. Their findings demonstrate that even after falling from a great height like the Empire State Building, the penny would not have enough energy to inflict severe harm or cause death. However, it's important to note that while the penny itself isn't dangerous, dropping any object from a tall building can be. Even a harmless penny can startle or distract someone, potentially leading to hazardous situations in a busy city environment. In summary, while a penny dropped from the Empire State Building won't kill you, keeping all objects, no matter how small or seemingly harmless, from free-falling off tall structures is best. Not because of the potential physical harm they could inflict but due to the potential for distraction and surprise they could cause in the bustling city life below. Over the years, numerous individuals and organizations have tested the lethal penny myth in real-life scenarios to debunk it. Here are a few notable experiments and studies conducted: MythBusters: In one of their episodes, the MythBusters team recreated the scenario by dropping a penny from a height equivalent to that of the Empire State Building. Using a wind tunnel and a high-speed camera, they determined that a penny reaches its terminal velocity of about 50 miles per hour. When they fired a penny at this speed into a skull analog, it bounced off, debunking the myth that a penny dropped from a great height could kill a pedestrian. Scientific American: Similarly, Scientific American conducted a theoretical study. They, too, concluded that the terminal velocity\n\nquestion: At what speed would a penny hit the ground when dropped from a height beyond which it could reach its terminal velocity?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "50 miles per hour", "usage": 1125}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Purdue University Study: Physicist Louis Bloomfield from the University of Virginia experimented and found that the maximum speed a penny could reach was 30 to 50 miles per hour - not nearly fast enough to kill or seriously injure anyone. Bloomfield further explained that the penny's shape and mass prevent it from becoming a deadly projectile. Each of these experiments concluded that contrary to popular belief, a penny dropped from the height of the Empire State Building is not deadly. While it's not advised (or legal) to throw objects from tall buildings due to potential unintended consequences, fears of lethal pennies can be laid to rest. So what would happen if someone dropped a penny from the top of the Empire State Building? Simply put, it would fall to the ground, but it wouldn't cause the catastrophic damage popular myth might have you believe. As we've established, a penny can only reach a terminal velocity of around 50 miles per hour due to its shape and mass. When it eventually hits the ground, or perhaps an unfortunate passerby, it wouldn't travel fast enough to cause serious harm. At most, getting hit by such a penny might feel like being flicked, not pleasant by any means, but far from deadly. Additionally, the urban environment surrounding the Empire State Building would influence the coin's descent. The wind could carry the penny off course, and the various skyscrapers could act as barriers. It's also worth noting that the Empire State Building observation decks are enclosed by tall fences specifically designed to prevent objects from being dropped. So, while it's an intriguing thought experiment, the reality is relatively mundane and much safer. The danger of a penny dropped from the Empire State Building is an enduring urban myth. A penny dropped from the Empire State Building can cause serious harm, so it's crucial to highlight the importance of safety and legality. Regardless of the physics involved, throwing objects off tall buildings is dangerous and illegal. While a penny may not have the capacity to kill, it could startle pedestrians, possibly causing accidents or triggering panic. Objects with more mass or aerodynamic shape can become lethal projectiles when dropped from significant heights. Legally, dropping objects from tall buildings like the Empire State Building is considered reckless endangerment and is punishable by law. The exact consequences can vary, but they may include hefty fines, imprisonment, or both. This rule isn't limited to just coins but applies to any objects that could harm individuals or property. Moreover, buildings like the Empire State Building have strict safety regulations, including protective barriers around observation decks to prevent such incidents.

He also said, though, that people have thrown pennies off the side in the past, but they end up landing on other terraces on the lower floors.\u201d After hearing this, I was curious and did a little more research. After checking a few different sources, it turns out the urban legend is in fact completely false. According to the book Empire State Building, a penny tossed from the top of the Empire State Building will never even hit the ground. The updraft effect pushes falling objects against the building and end up falling only a few stories below. The coins that are dropped from the 86th floor simply land on the 80th floor and are collected by electricians when they change the lights on the outer side of the building. Furthermore, according to an experiment that was performed for the ABC show \u201c20/20,\u201d even if the pennies dodge the 80th floor landing, the pennies are still harmless to pedestrians below. After sending a large weather balloon into the air with an attached penny dispenser, Louis Bloomberg \u2013 a University of Virginia physics professor \u2013 spit the pennies one by one through a remote control device. Several pennies hit Bloomberg but \u201cit was like getting hit by a bug\u2026it was noticeable, but nothing more\u2026these things are just fluttering down.\u201d Another experiment was performed on the show \u201cMythbusters\u201d that tested the degree of impact at terminal velocity (the speed at which the penny would fall if no other factors such as friction acted upon the coin) on asphalt, cement, concrete and an anatomically correct human head replica. The experiment revealed that the penny would not penetrate any surfaces. As far as the human skull, a penny at terminal velocity may break the skin, but will not break through or fracture the skull.

Hopefully, any worries one might have of being killed by a falling penny as they stroll by tall buildings in New York will be quelled. After all, people are usually not injured by hail falling from the clouds. We will apply Newton's laws of motion to two cases. At first we will neglect air resistance (drag) so we can solve the problem analytically. Then we will use a simple model of drag to show how the penny reaches a terminal velocity and how this dramatically affects the impact velocity of the penny on the ground. When the only force acting on a body as it falls toward another body, similar to an apple falling to the Earth, is gravity then we say the body is in free fall. The only way we can do this is if we neglet things like drag caused by the atmosphere, wind or variations in The Gravitational Field. This situation is depicted in Figure 1, where the force due to gravity is F = \u2212 m g {\\displaystyle F=-mg} \\includegraphics{FreeFallAcceleration.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 1:} Penny falling from Empire State Building The two things we want to calculate is the velocity of the penny when it impacts the ground and the time it takes the penny to fall. Applying Newton's second law to the penny F = m a {\\displaystyle F=ma} yields the acceleration of the penny in the y direction a ( t ) = F m = \u2212 m g m = \u2212 g. {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {F}{m}}=-{\\frac {mg}{m}}=-g\\,.} Notice that the minus sign comes from the coordinate system choice with the y axis pointing up. Next, integrate the acceleration equation to get the velocity of the penny at a given time. Remember that the acceleration is defined as a = d v d t. {\\displaystyle a={\\frac {dv}{dt}}.} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d v = \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=-\\int gdt.} Integrate to get v ( t ) = \u2212 g t + C. {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt+C.} The constant is found using initial conditions, so at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, the velocity of the penny is zero v ( 0 ) = 0 = \u2212 g ( 0 ) + C. {\\displaystyle v(0)=0=-g(0)+C.} This is only true if C is also zero, therefore the velocity equation is v ( t ) = \u2212 g t {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt} Well, this is great, we can find the velocity at any given time. However, we do not know the time of the impact. For this we must integrate (1) to get the position of the penny. Remember, that velocity is defined as v = d x d t {\\displaystyle v={\\frac {dx}{dt}}} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d x = \u2212 \u222b g t d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dx=-\\int gtdt.} Integrate to get x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + C. {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+C.} Once again, the constant is found from the initial condition, at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, x ( 0 ) = h {\\displaystyle x(0)=h}. Therefore, the position equation is x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + h {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+h} What we want is the time of impact. This happens when x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0}. So solve (2) for t {\\displaystyle t}. 0 = \u2212 1 2 g t f 2 + h. {\\displaystyle 0=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt_{f}^{2}+h.} Rearrange to get t f = 2 h g {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {2h}{g}}}} Evaluate (3), using the value g = 9.8 {\\displaystyle g=9.8}, to get t f = ( 2 ) \u2217 ( 381 ) 9.8 {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {(2)*(381)}{9.8}}}} t f = 8.82 . {\\displaystyle t_{f}=8.82\\,\\,.} Finally, we get the velocity at impact by substituting (3) into (1) v ( t f ) = \u2212 g 2 h g. {\\displaystyle v(t_{f})=-g{\\sqrt {\\\n\nquestion: At what speed would a penny hit the ground when dropped from a height beyond which it could reach its terminal velocity?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1129}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the next section we will model air resistance to capture this effect. Since the penny is traveling through the atmosphere (a fluid), we need to use some basic results from fluid mechanics to model the drag force acting on the penny. A simple model combined with experimental data results in the drag expression F d = 1 2 C d \u03c1 A v 2 {\\displaystyle F_{d}={\\frac {1}{2}}C_{d}\\rho Av^{2}} where C d {\\displaystyle C_{d}} is the drag coefficient of the penny. It is an experimantly derived value and here we will use the value given by, C d = 1.17. {\\displaystyle C_{d}=1.17.} The drag force is in the opposite direction of the velocity vector as shown in the free body diagram in Figure 2. \\includegraphics{FreeBodyDiagram.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 2:} Free Body Diagram The density we will use is the standard day value at sea level given in the tables from, \u03c1 = 1.225  {\\displaystyle \\rho =1.225\\,\\,} Next A {\\displaystyle A}, is the effective cross-sectional area of the penny, From Wikipedia, the diameter of the US penny is D = 19.05  = 1.905 \u00d7 10 \u2212 2  {\\displaystyle D=19.05\\,\\,=1.905\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\,} So the cross-sectional area is then A = \u03c0 r 2 = \u03c0 D 2 4 = 0.000286 m 2 {\\displaystyle A=\\pi r^{2}=\\pi {\\frac {D^{2}}{4}}=0.000286m^{2}} Combining all these constants gives us the drag force that is proportional to the square of the velocity F d = 0.0002 v 2. {\\displaystyle F_{d}=0.0002v^{2}.} Now we have 2 forces to use with Newton's second law, this gives the acceleration equation as a ( t ) = 0.0002 v 2 m \u2212 g {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}-g} The integral setup is then \u222b d v = \u222b 0.0002 v 2 m d t \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=\\int {\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}dt-\\int gdt.} Unlike the free fall example, the analytical solution is a litte more difficult. However, all is not lost. We will first turn to numerical methods such as Euler's method or numerical programs such as Matlab, Octave or Maple and then later compare with analytical solution (coming soon). Here we will solve the differential equation using Octave. First a little setup must be done to use Octave's lsode solver. The differential equation of motion that we will solve with the mass of the penny, m = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3  {\\displaystyle m=2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\,}  d 2 x d t 2 = 0.0817 ( d x d t ) 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}}=0.0817\\left({\\frac {dx}{dt}}\\right)^{2}-9.8} We cannot use a 2nd order differential equation in lsode, so we must use two 1st order equations. This is done by using two states, one for position and another for velocity. Then our equations of motion become y \u02d9 = y \u02d9 {\\displaystyle {\\dot {y}}={\\dot {y}}} y \u00a8 = 0.0817 y \u02d9 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\ddot {y}}=0.0817{\\dot {y}}^{2}-9.8} The commands in octave are t = lines\n\nquestion: At what speed would a penny hit the ground when dropped from a height beyond which it could reach its terminal velocity?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1137}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In reality, the motion is a little more complicated due to winds and the fact that the penny will tumble, but understanding how a falling object reaches terminal velocity is something to take away.

In the story, the penny falls and kills a pedestrian on the sidewalk below. This is one of those classic urban legends that is untrue but contains a grain of truth. Advertisement Throwing a penny off the Empire State Building wouldn't kill someone. A penny only weighs about a gram and it tumbles as it falls. Even though this is one of the tallest buildings in the world because of the tumbling and the light weight, there's so much air resistance that the penny never really gathers that much speed before it hits its terminal velocity. A gram of weight traveling at a relatively slow speed might hurt a little if it hit you on the head, but it's not going to kill you. The grain of truth embedded in this urban legend is the fact that falling objects -- even ones that seem harmless -- can do a lot of damage. That's why people on construction sites wear hard hats. If a big nut or bolt weighing 50 grams (about 1.8 ounces) falls and hits you on the head, it's going to do some serious damage, and depending on the height it falls from, it could definitely kill you if it hit right on top of your skull. To get an idea of the damage it can do, let's take a look at a bullet. A bullet might weigh 5 to 10 grams, and it leaves the barrel of a gun at anywhere from 800 to 2,000 miles per hour, depending on the type of gun, the type of bullet and the amount of powder behind the bullet. A 44-caliber bullet weighs about 9 grams. Let's assume it leaves the gun at 1,000 miles per hour. That gives it a muzzle energy of about 300 foot-pounds (1 foot-pound is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 pound 1 foot in the air). Three-hundred foot-pounds of energy is clearly enough to kill someone. Even a third of that is enough to kill someone. A 1-gram penny falling from the Empire State Building might reach 100 miles per hour. It has a little less than 1 foot-pound of energy when it hits, and just hurts a little. If a 50-gram nut, or a roll of pennies weighing 50 grams, were to fall from the Empire State Building, it would fall about 1,000 feet. Ignoring air resistance, it would reach a velocity of about 250 miles per hour. That gives it energy of about 100 foot-pounds, which is fatal if it hits you on the head. If you're wearing a hard hat, however, you'll survive.

But is there any truth to this notion? It's a question that merges urban legend with physics, legality, and public safety. In this article, we'll unpack the supposedly lethal penny's science, explore real-life experiments and studies, and discuss the legal and safety considerations of dropping any object from such heights. As we delve into this topic, we'll uncover what happens if someone drops a penny off the Empire State Building. The perception that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could be lethal is based on the idea that an object falling from such a height would accumulate extraordinary speed, making it deadly upon impact. However, this idea doesn't hold up when we consider the principles of physics, specifically the interplay between gravity, terminal velocity, and the specific characteristics of the penny itself. When any object is dropped from a height, it initially starts with a speed of zero, then accelerates downwards due to the force of gravity. Without air resistance, all objects, irrespective of their mass, would continue accelerating at around 9.8 m/s\u00b2 until they hit the ground. However, our world is filled with air, which drastically changes the picture. The penny, as it falls, collides with air molecules. These collisions create a drag force that opposes the penny's downward motion. As the penny picks up speed, the drag force increases until it equals the force of gravity acting on the penny. At this point, the penny no longer accelerates and continues to fall at a constant speed called terminal velocity. The terminal velocity of an object depends on its shape and mass. For a small, flat object like a penny, the terminal velocity is quite low due to the relatively large surface area encountering air resistance compared to its weight. Estimates put the terminal velocity of a penny at around 50 miles per hour. Therefore, if you were to drop a penny from the Empire State Building (or any other height beyond which it could reach its terminal velocity), it would hit the ground at its terminal velocity, not at speed proportional to the height it was dropped from. At around 50 miles per hour, it might sting, but it wouldn't cause serious injury. Additionally, the design of skyscrapers often causes updrafts, which could cause the penny to be blown off course, potentially even causing it to end up higher than the starting point. In conclusion, dropping a penny from the Empire State Building is unlikely to cause damage due to its terminal velocity. However, it's still not advised because it can be a nuisance or distraction, which can be hazardous in a bustling city like New York. Contrary to popular urban legend, a penny falling from the Empire State Building or any other skyscraper won't kill a pedestrian on the ground. This myth has been propagated through various means, from casual conversations to being stated as fact in movies and television shows. In reality, physics doesn't support this claim. When an object falls through the atmosphere, two primary forces are acting on it: gravity, which pulls it downward, and air resistance, which opposes its downward motion. For a penny, its flat, thin, and lightweight characteristics contribute to a low terminal velocity \u2014 the highest speed it can achieve when falling. As mentioned, this terminal velocity is estimated to be around 50 miles per hour. A penny might sting if it hit you at this speed, but it would hardly be lethal. Several physicists and science TV shows like MythBusters have debunked this myth through calculations and practical experiments. Their findings demonstrate that even after falling from a great height like the Empire State Building, the penny would not have enough energy to inflict severe harm or cause death. However, it's important to note that while the penny itself isn't dangerous, dropping any object from a tall building can be. Even a harmless penny can startle or distract someone, potentially leading to hazardous situations in a busy city environment. In summary, while a penny dropped from the Empire State Building won't kill you, keeping all objects, no matter how small or seemingly harmless, from free-falling off tall structures is best. Not because of the potential physical harm they could inflict but due to the potential for distraction and surprise they could cause in the bustling city life below. Over the years, numerous individuals and organizations have tested the lethal penny myth in real-life scenarios to debunk it. Here are a few notable experiments and studies conducted: MythBusters: In one of their episodes, the MythBusters team recreated the scenario by dropping a penny from a height equivalent to that of the Empire State Building. Using a wind tunnel and a high-speed camera, they determined that a penny reaches its terminal velocity of about 50 miles per hour. When they fired a penny at this speed into a skull analog, it bounced off, debunking the myth that a penny dropped from a great height could kill a pedestrian. Scientific American: Similarly, Scientific American conducted a theoretical study. They, too, concluded that the terminal velocity\n\nquestion: What would happen if a penny was dropped from the top of the Empire State Building and hit someone?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "At around 50 miles per hour, it might sting, but it wouldn't cause serious injury.", "usage": 1138}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Purdue University Study: Physicist Louis Bloomfield from the University of Virginia experimented and found that the maximum speed a penny could reach was 30 to 50 miles per hour - not nearly fast enough to kill or seriously injure anyone. Bloomfield further explained that the penny's shape and mass prevent it from becoming a deadly projectile. Each of these experiments concluded that contrary to popular belief, a penny dropped from the height of the Empire State Building is not deadly. While it's not advised (or legal) to throw objects from tall buildings due to potential unintended consequences, fears of lethal pennies can be laid to rest. So what would happen if someone dropped a penny from the top of the Empire State Building? Simply put, it would fall to the ground, but it wouldn't cause the catastrophic damage popular myth might have you believe. As we've established, a penny can only reach a terminal velocity of around 50 miles per hour due to its shape and mass. When it eventually hits the ground, or perhaps an unfortunate passerby, it wouldn't travel fast enough to cause serious harm. At most, getting hit by such a penny might feel like being flicked, not pleasant by any means, but far from deadly. Additionally, the urban environment surrounding the Empire State Building would influence the coin's descent. The wind could carry the penny off course, and the various skyscrapers could act as barriers. It's also worth noting that the Empire State Building observation decks are enclosed by tall fences specifically designed to prevent objects from being dropped. So, while it's an intriguing thought experiment, the reality is relatively mundane and much safer. The danger of a penny dropped from the Empire State Building is an enduring urban myth. A penny dropped from the Empire State Building can cause serious harm, so it's crucial to highlight the importance of safety and legality. Regardless of the physics involved, throwing objects off tall buildings is dangerous and illegal. While a penny may not have the capacity to kill, it could startle pedestrians, possibly causing accidents or triggering panic. Objects with more mass or aerodynamic shape can become lethal projectiles when dropped from significant heights. Legally, dropping objects from tall buildings like the Empire State Building is considered reckless endangerment and is punishable by law. The exact consequences can vary, but they may include hefty fines, imprisonment, or both. This rule isn't limited to just coins but applies to any objects that could harm individuals or property. Moreover, buildings like the Empire State Building have strict safety regulations, including protective barriers around observation decks to prevent such incidents.

Hopefully, any worries one might have of being killed by a falling penny as they stroll by tall buildings in New York will be quelled. After all, people are usually not injured by hail falling from the clouds. We will apply Newton's laws of motion to two cases. At first we will neglect air resistance (drag) so we can solve the problem analytically. Then we will use a simple model of drag to show how the penny reaches a terminal velocity and how this dramatically affects the impact velocity of the penny on the ground. When the only force acting on a body as it falls toward another body, similar to an apple falling to the Earth, is gravity then we say the body is in free fall. The only way we can do this is if we neglet things like drag caused by the atmosphere, wind or variations in The Gravitational Field. This situation is depicted in Figure 1, where the force due to gravity is F = \u2212 m g {\\displaystyle F=-mg} \\includegraphics{FreeFallAcceleration.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 1:} Penny falling from Empire State Building The two things we want to calculate is the velocity of the penny when it impacts the ground and the time it takes the penny to fall. Applying Newton's second law to the penny F = m a {\\displaystyle F=ma} yields the acceleration of the penny in the y direction a ( t ) = F m = \u2212 m g m = \u2212 g. {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {F}{m}}=-{\\frac {mg}{m}}=-g\\,.} Notice that the minus sign comes from the coordinate system choice with the y axis pointing up. Next, integrate the acceleration equation to get the velocity of the penny at a given time. Remember that the acceleration is defined as a = d v d t. {\\displaystyle a={\\frac {dv}{dt}}.} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d v = \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=-\\int gdt.} Integrate to get v ( t ) = \u2212 g t + C. {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt+C.} The constant is found using initial conditions, so at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, the velocity of the penny is zero v ( 0 ) = 0 = \u2212 g ( 0 ) + C. {\\displaystyle v(0)=0=-g(0)+C.} This is only true if C is also zero, therefore the velocity equation is v ( t ) = \u2212 g t {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt} Well, this is great, we can find the velocity at any given time. However, we do not know the time of the impact. For this we must integrate (1) to get the position of the penny. Remember, that velocity is defined as v = d x d t {\\displaystyle v={\\frac {dx}{dt}}} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d x = \u2212 \u222b g t d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dx=-\\int gtdt.} Integrate to get x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + C. {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+C.} Once again, the constant is found from the initial condition, at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, x ( 0 ) = h {\\displaystyle x(0)=h}. Therefore, the position equation is x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + h {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+h} What we want is the time of impact. This happens when x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0}. So solve (2) for t {\\displaystyle t}. 0 = \u2212 1 2 g t f 2 + h. {\\displaystyle 0=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt_{f}^{2}+h.} Rearrange to get t f = 2 h g {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {2h}{g}}}} Evaluate (3), using the value g = 9.8 {\\displaystyle g=9.8}, to get t f = ( 2 ) \u2217 ( 381 ) 9.8 {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {(2)*(381)}{9.8}}}} t f = 8.82 . {\\displaystyle t_{f}=8.82\\,\\,.} Finally, we get the velocity at impact by substituting (3) into (1) v ( t f ) = \u2212 g 2 h g. {\\displaystyle v(t_{f})=-g{\\sqrt {\\\n\nquestion: What would happen if a penny was dropped from the top of the Empire State Building and hit someone?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1126}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the next section we will model air resistance to capture this effect. Since the penny is traveling through the atmosphere (a fluid), we need to use some basic results from fluid mechanics to model the drag force acting on the penny. A simple model combined with experimental data results in the drag expression F d = 1 2 C d \u03c1 A v 2 {\\displaystyle F_{d}={\\frac {1}{2}}C_{d}\\rho Av^{2}} where C d {\\displaystyle C_{d}} is the drag coefficient of the penny. It is an experimantly derived value and here we will use the value given by, C d = 1.17. {\\displaystyle C_{d}=1.17.} The drag force is in the opposite direction of the velocity vector as shown in the free body diagram in Figure 2. \\includegraphics{FreeBodyDiagram.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 2:} Free Body Diagram The density we will use is the standard day value at sea level given in the tables from, \u03c1 = 1.225  {\\displaystyle \\rho =1.225\\,\\,} Next A {\\displaystyle A}, is the effective cross-sectional area of the penny, From Wikipedia, the diameter of the US penny is D = 19.05  = 1.905 \u00d7 10 \u2212 2  {\\displaystyle D=19.05\\,\\,=1.905\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\,} So the cross-sectional area is then A = \u03c0 r 2 = \u03c0 D 2 4 = 0.000286 m 2 {\\displaystyle A=\\pi r^{2}=\\pi {\\frac {D^{2}}{4}}=0.000286m^{2}} Combining all these constants gives us the drag force that is proportional to the square of the velocity F d = 0.0002 v 2. {\\displaystyle F_{d}=0.0002v^{2}.} Now we have 2 forces to use with Newton's second law, this gives the acceleration equation as a ( t ) = 0.0002 v 2 m \u2212 g {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}-g} The integral setup is then \u222b d v = \u222b 0.0002 v 2 m d t \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=\\int {\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}dt-\\int gdt.} Unlike the free fall example, the analytical solution is a litte more difficult. However, all is not lost. We will first turn to numerical methods such as Euler's method or numerical programs such as Matlab, Octave or Maple and then later compare with analytical solution (coming soon). Here we will solve the differential equation using Octave. First a little setup must be done to use Octave's lsode solver. The differential equation of motion that we will solve with the mass of the penny, m = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3  {\\displaystyle m=2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\,}  d 2 x d t 2 = 0.0817 ( d x d t ) 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}}=0.0817\\left({\\frac {dx}{dt}}\\right)^{2}-9.8} We cannot use a 2nd order differential equation in lsode, so we must use two 1st order equations. This is done by using two states, one for position and another for velocity. Then our equations of motion become y \u02d9 = y \u02d9 {\\displaystyle {\\dot {y}}={\\dot {y}}} y \u00a8 = 0.0817 y \u02d9 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\ddot {y}}=0.0817{\\dot {y}}^{2}-9.8} The commands in octave are t = lines\n\nquestion: What would happen if a penny was dropped from the top of the Empire State Building and hit someone?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1134}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the story, the penny falls and kills a pedestrian on the sidewalk below. This is one of those classic urban legends that is untrue but contains a grain of truth. Advertisement Throwing a penny off the Empire State Building wouldn't kill someone. A penny only weighs about a gram and it tumbles as it falls. Even though this is one of the tallest buildings in the world because of the tumbling and the light weight, there's so much air resistance that the penny never really gathers that much speed before it hits its terminal velocity. A gram of weight traveling at a relatively slow speed might hurt a little if it hit you on the head, but it's not going to kill you. The grain of truth embedded in this urban legend is the fact that falling objects -- even ones that seem harmless -- can do a lot of damage. That's why people on construction sites wear hard hats. If a big nut or bolt weighing 50 grams (about 1.8 ounces) falls and hits you on the head, it's going to do some serious damage, and depending on the height it falls from, it could definitely kill you if it hit right on top of your skull. To get an idea of the damage it can do, let's take a look at a bullet. A bullet might weigh 5 to 10 grams, and it leaves the barrel of a gun at anywhere from 800 to 2,000 miles per hour, depending on the type of gun, the type of bullet and the amount of powder behind the bullet. A 44-caliber bullet weighs about 9 grams. Let's assume it leaves the gun at 1,000 miles per hour. That gives it a muzzle energy of about 300 foot-pounds (1 foot-pound is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 pound 1 foot in the air). Three-hundred foot-pounds of energy is clearly enough to kill someone. Even a third of that is enough to kill someone. A 1-gram penny falling from the Empire State Building might reach 100 miles per hour. It has a little less than 1 foot-pound of energy when it hits, and just hurts a little. If a 50-gram nut, or a roll of pennies weighing 50 grams, were to fall from the Empire State Building, it would fall about 1,000 feet. Ignoring air resistance, it would reach a velocity of about 250 miles per hour. That gives it energy of about 100 foot-pounds, which is fatal if it hits you on the head. If you're wearing a hard hat, however, you'll survive.

But is there any truth to this notion? It's a question that merges urban legend with physics, legality, and public safety. In this article, we'll unpack the supposedly lethal penny's science, explore real-life experiments and studies, and discuss the legal and safety considerations of dropping any object from such heights. As we delve into this topic, we'll uncover what happens if someone drops a penny off the Empire State Building. The perception that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could be lethal is based on the idea that an object falling from such a height would accumulate extraordinary speed, making it deadly upon impact. However, this idea doesn't hold up when we consider the principles of physics, specifically the interplay between gravity, terminal velocity, and the specific characteristics of the penny itself. When any object is dropped from a height, it initially starts with a speed of zero, then accelerates downwards due to the force of gravity. Without air resistance, all objects, irrespective of their mass, would continue accelerating at around 9.8 m/s\u00b2 until they hit the ground. However, our world is filled with air, which drastically changes the picture. The penny, as it falls, collides with air molecules. These collisions create a drag force that opposes the penny's downward motion. As the penny picks up speed, the drag force increases until it equals the force of gravity acting on the penny. At this point, the penny no longer accelerates and continues to fall at a constant speed called terminal velocity. The terminal velocity of an object depends on its shape and mass. For a small, flat object like a penny, the terminal velocity is quite low due to the relatively large surface area encountering air resistance compared to its weight. Estimates put the terminal velocity of a penny at around 50 miles per hour. Therefore, if you were to drop a penny from the Empire State Building (or any other height beyond which it could reach its terminal velocity), it would hit the ground at its terminal velocity, not at speed proportional to the height it was dropped from. At around 50 miles per hour, it might sting, but it wouldn't cause serious injury. Additionally, the design of skyscrapers often causes updrafts, which could cause the penny to be blown off course, potentially even causing it to end up higher than the starting point. In conclusion, dropping a penny from the Empire State Building is unlikely to cause damage due to its terminal velocity. However, it's still not advised because it can be a nuisance or distraction, which can be hazardous in a bustling city like New York. Contrary to popular urban legend, a penny falling from the Empire State Building or any other skyscraper won't kill a pedestrian on the ground. This myth has been propagated through various means, from casual conversations to being stated as fact in movies and television shows. In reality, physics doesn't support this claim. When an object falls through the atmosphere, two primary forces are acting on it: gravity, which pulls it downward, and air resistance, which opposes its downward motion. For a penny, its flat, thin, and lightweight characteristics contribute to a low terminal velocity \u2014 the highest speed it can achieve when falling. As mentioned, this terminal velocity is estimated to be around 50 miles per hour. A penny might sting if it hit you at this speed, but it would hardly be lethal. Several physicists and science TV shows like MythBusters have debunked this myth through calculations and practical experiments. Their findings demonstrate that even after falling from a great height like the Empire State Building, the penny would not have enough energy to inflict severe harm or cause death. However, it's important to note that while the penny itself isn't dangerous, dropping any object from a tall building can be. Even a harmless penny can startle or distract someone, potentially leading to hazardous situations in a busy city environment. In summary, while a penny dropped from the Empire State Building won't kill you, keeping all objects, no matter how small or seemingly harmless, from free-falling off tall structures is best. Not because of the potential physical harm they could inflict but due to the potential for distraction and surprise they could cause in the bustling city life below. Over the years, numerous individuals and organizations have tested the lethal penny myth in real-life scenarios to debunk it. Here are a few notable experiments and studies conducted: MythBusters: In one of their episodes, the MythBusters team recreated the scenario by dropping a penny from a height equivalent to that of the Empire State Building. Using a wind tunnel and a high-speed camera, they determined that a penny reaches its terminal velocity of about 50 miles per hour. When they fired a penny at this speed into a skull analog, it bounced off, debunking the myth that a penny dropped from a great height could kill a pedestrian. Scientific American: Similarly, Scientific American conducted a theoretical study. They, too, concluded that the terminal velocity\n\nquestion: What happens to the penny as it falls?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The penny reaches its terminal velocity of about 50 miles per hour, which is not enough to cause serious injury.", "usage": 1130}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Purdue University Study: Physicist Louis Bloomfield from the University of Virginia experimented and found that the maximum speed a penny could reach was 30 to 50 miles per hour - not nearly fast enough to kill or seriously injure anyone. Bloomfield further explained that the penny's shape and mass prevent it from becoming a deadly projectile. Each of these experiments concluded that contrary to popular belief, a penny dropped from the height of the Empire State Building is not deadly. While it's not advised (or legal) to throw objects from tall buildings due to potential unintended consequences, fears of lethal pennies can be laid to rest. So what would happen if someone dropped a penny from the top of the Empire State Building? Simply put, it would fall to the ground, but it wouldn't cause the catastrophic damage popular myth might have you believe. As we've established, a penny can only reach a terminal velocity of around 50 miles per hour due to its shape and mass. When it eventually hits the ground, or perhaps an unfortunate passerby, it wouldn't travel fast enough to cause serious harm. At most, getting hit by such a penny might feel like being flicked, not pleasant by any means, but far from deadly. Additionally, the urban environment surrounding the Empire State Building would influence the coin's descent. The wind could carry the penny off course, and the various skyscrapers could act as barriers. It's also worth noting that the Empire State Building observation decks are enclosed by tall fences specifically designed to prevent objects from being dropped. So, while it's an intriguing thought experiment, the reality is relatively mundane and much safer. The danger of a penny dropped from the Empire State Building is an enduring urban myth. A penny dropped from the Empire State Building can cause serious harm, so it's crucial to highlight the importance of safety and legality. Regardless of the physics involved, throwing objects off tall buildings is dangerous and illegal. While a penny may not have the capacity to kill, it could startle pedestrians, possibly causing accidents or triggering panic. Objects with more mass or aerodynamic shape can become lethal projectiles when dropped from significant heights. Legally, dropping objects from tall buildings like the Empire State Building is considered reckless endangerment and is punishable by law. The exact consequences can vary, but they may include hefty fines, imprisonment, or both. This rule isn't limited to just coins but applies to any objects that could harm individuals or property. Moreover, buildings like the Empire State Building have strict safety regulations, including protective barriers around observation decks to prevent such incidents.

It was a common piece of information that was spread across the playground. It is such a common urban legend that most of my other informants and I, too, have heard the same declaration. From when she was younger, her general understanding is that when dropped from the top balcony of the Empire State Building, the penny will gradually increase in velocity. As it gets closer to the ground, it will reach the speed of a bullet. If by chance the penny strikes a person in the head, the penny will go straight through and kill the person. She also says that there are variations of the legend: it will put a hole in the cement sidewalk, the coin will break to pieces, and even, that it has been used to purposefully kill someone. She laughed when she said the last variant saying: \u201cI have no idea how or why someone would strategically plan to kill someone with a penny\u2026 on the top of the Empire State Building. You wouldn\u2019t even be able to identify the right person from that high up!  \u2026I don\u2019t know, it was just something I heard from grade school.\u201d My informant told me that she remembered this \u201cfact\u201d so well that when she actually went to New York when she was in high school, she asked one of the tour guides if it had ever happened: \u201cThe guide told me that he got that one a lot, but he reassured me that it wasn\u2019t even possible. Supposedly, since the building is so tall, the updraft will slow the penny\u2019s speed as it falls and won\u2019t cause any damage. He also said, though, that people have thrown pennies off the side in the past, but they end up landing on other terraces on the lower floors.\u201d After hearing this, I was curious and did a little more research. After checking a few different sources, it turns out the urban legend is in fact completely false. According to the book Empire State Building, a penny tossed from the top of the Empire State Building will never even hit the ground. The updraft effect pushes falling objects against the building and end up falling only a few stories below. The coins that are dropped from the 86th floor simply land on the 80th floor and are collected by electricians when they change the lights on the outer side of the building. Furthermore, according to an experiment that was performed for the ABC show \u201c20/20,\u201d even if the pennies dodge the 80th floor landing, the pennies are still harmless to pedestrians below. After sending a large weather balloon into the air with an attached penny dispenser, Louis Bloomberg \u2013 a University of Virginia physics professor \u2013 spit the pennies one by one through a remote control device. Several pennies hit Bloomberg but \u201cit was like getting hit by a bug\u2026it was noticeable, but nothing more\u2026these things are just fluttering down.\u201d Another experiment was performed on the show \u201cMythbusters\u201d that tested the degree of impact at terminal velocity (the speed at which the penny would fall if no other factors such as friction acted upon the coin) on asphalt, cement, concrete and an anatomically correct human head replica. The experiment revealed that the penny would not penetrate any surfaces. As far as the human skull, a penny at terminal velocity may break the skin, but will not break through or fracture the skull.

Hopefully, any worries one might have of being killed by a falling penny as they stroll by tall buildings in New York will be quelled. After all, people are usually not injured by hail falling from the clouds. We will apply Newton's laws of motion to two cases. At first we will neglect air resistance (drag) so we can solve the problem analytically. Then we will use a simple model of drag to show how the penny reaches a terminal velocity and how this dramatically affects the impact velocity of the penny on the ground. When the only force acting on a body as it falls toward another body, similar to an apple falling to the Earth, is gravity then we say the body is in free fall. The only way we can do this is if we neglet things like drag caused by the atmosphere, wind or variations in The Gravitational Field. This situation is depicted in Figure 1, where the force due to gravity is F = \u2212 m g {\\displaystyle F=-mg} \\includegraphics{FreeFallAcceleration.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 1:} Penny falling from Empire State Building The two things we want to calculate is the velocity of the penny when it impacts the ground and the time it takes the penny to fall. Applying Newton's second law to the penny F = m a {\\displaystyle F=ma} yields the acceleration of the penny in the y direction a ( t ) = F m = \u2212 m g m = \u2212 g. {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {F}{m}}=-{\\frac {mg}{m}}=-g\\,.} Notice that the minus sign comes from the coordinate system choice with the y axis pointing up. Next, integrate the acceleration equation to get the velocity of the penny at a given time. Remember that the acceleration is defined as a = d v d t. {\\displaystyle a={\\frac {dv}{dt}}.} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d v = \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=-\\int gdt.} Integrate to get v ( t ) = \u2212 g t + C. {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt+C.} The constant is found using initial conditions, so at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, the velocity of the penny is zero v ( 0 ) = 0 = \u2212 g ( 0 ) + C. {\\displaystyle v(0)=0=-g(0)+C.} This is only true if C is also zero, therefore the velocity equation is v ( t ) = \u2212 g t {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt} Well, this is great, we can find the velocity at any given time. However, we do not know the time of the impact. For this we must integrate (1) to get the position of the penny. Remember, that velocity is defined as v = d x d t {\\displaystyle v={\\frac {dx}{dt}}} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d x = \u2212 \u222b g t d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dx=-\\int gtdt.} Integrate to get x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + C. {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+C.} Once again, the constant is found from the initial condition, at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, x ( 0 ) = h {\\displaystyle x(0)=h}. Therefore, the position equation is x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + h {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+h} What we want is the time of impact. This happens when x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0}. So solve (2) for t {\\displaystyle t}. 0 = \u2212 1 2 g t f 2 + h. {\\displaystyle 0=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt_{f}^{2}+h.} Rearrange to get t f = 2 h g {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {2h}{g}}}} Evaluate (3), using the value g = 9.8 {\\displaystyle g=9.8}, to get t f = ( 2 ) \u2217 ( 381 ) 9.8 {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {(2)*(381)}{9.8}}}} t f = 8.82 . {\\displaystyle t_{f}=8.82\\,\\,.} Finally, we get the velocity at impact by substituting (3) into (1) v ( t f ) = \u2212 g 2 h g. {\\displaystyle v(t_{f})=-g{\\sqrt {\\\n\nquestion: What happens to the penny as it falls?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1115}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the next section we will model air resistance to capture this effect. Since the penny is traveling through the atmosphere (a fluid), we need to use some basic results from fluid mechanics to model the drag force acting on the penny. A simple model combined with experimental data results in the drag expression F d = 1 2 C d \u03c1 A v 2 {\\displaystyle F_{d}={\\frac {1}{2}}C_{d}\\rho Av^{2}} where C d {\\displaystyle C_{d}} is the drag coefficient of the penny. It is an experimantly derived value and here we will use the value given by, C d = 1.17. {\\displaystyle C_{d}=1.17.} The drag force is in the opposite direction of the velocity vector as shown in the free body diagram in Figure 2. \\includegraphics{FreeBodyDiagram.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 2:} Free Body Diagram The density we will use is the standard day value at sea level given in the tables from, \u03c1 = 1.225  {\\displaystyle \\rho =1.225\\,\\,} Next A {\\displaystyle A}, is the effective cross-sectional area of the penny, From Wikipedia, the diameter of the US penny is D = 19.05  = 1.905 \u00d7 10 \u2212 2  {\\displaystyle D=19.05\\,\\,=1.905\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\,} So the cross-sectional area is then A = \u03c0 r 2 = \u03c0 D 2 4 = 0.000286 m 2 {\\displaystyle A=\\pi r^{2}=\\pi {\\frac {D^{2}}{4}}=0.000286m^{2}} Combining all these constants gives us the drag force that is proportional to the square of the velocity F d = 0.0002 v 2. {\\displaystyle F_{d}=0.0002v^{2}.} Now we have 2 forces to use with Newton's second law, this gives the acceleration equation as a ( t ) = 0.0002 v 2 m \u2212 g {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}-g} The integral setup is then \u222b d v = \u222b 0.0002 v 2 m d t \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=\\int {\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}dt-\\int gdt.} Unlike the free fall example, the analytical solution is a litte more difficult. However, all is not lost. We will first turn to numerical methods such as Euler's method or numerical programs such as Matlab, Octave or Maple and then later compare with analytical solution (coming soon). Here we will solve the differential equation using Octave. First a little setup must be done to use Octave's lsode solver. The differential equation of motion that we will solve with the mass of the penny, m = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3  {\\displaystyle m=2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\,}  d 2 x d t 2 = 0.0817 ( d x d t ) 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}}=0.0817\\left({\\frac {dx}{dt}}\\right)^{2}-9.8} We cannot use a 2nd order differential equation in lsode, so we must use two 1st order equations. This is done by using two states, one for position and another for velocity.

In the story, the penny falls and kills a pedestrian on the sidewalk below. This is one of those classic urban legends that is untrue but contains a grain of truth. Advertisement Throwing a penny off the Empire State Building wouldn't kill someone. A penny only weighs about a gram and it tumbles as it falls. Even though this is one of the tallest buildings in the world because of the tumbling and the light weight, there's so much air resistance that the penny never really gathers that much speed before it hits its terminal velocity. A gram of weight traveling at a relatively slow speed might hurt a little if it hit you on the head, but it's not going to kill you. The grain of truth embedded in this urban legend is the fact that falling objects -- even ones that seem harmless -- can do a lot of damage. That's why people on construction sites wear hard hats. If a big nut or bolt weighing 50 grams (about 1.8 ounces) falls and hits you on the head, it's going to do some serious damage, and depending on the height it falls from, it could definitely kill you if it hit right on top of your skull. To get an idea of the damage it can do, let's take a look at a bullet. A bullet might weigh 5 to 10 grams, and it leaves the barrel of a gun at anywhere from 800 to 2,000 miles per hour, depending on the type of gun, the type of bullet and the amount of powder behind the bullet. A 44-caliber bullet weighs about 9 grams. Let's assume it leaves the gun at 1,000 miles per hour. That gives it a muzzle energy of about 300 foot-pounds (1 foot-pound is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 pound 1 foot in the air). Three-hundred foot-pounds of energy is clearly enough to kill someone. Even a third of that is enough to kill someone. A 1-gram penny falling from the Empire State Building might reach 100 miles per hour. It has a little less than 1 foot-pound of energy when it hits, and just hurts a little. If a 50-gram nut, or a roll of pennies weighing 50 grams, were to fall from the Empire State Building, it would fall about 1,000 feet. Ignoring air resistance, it would reach a velocity of about 250 miles per hour. That gives it energy of about 100 foot-pounds, which is fatal if it hits you on the head. If you're wearing a hard hat, however, you'll survive.

But is there any truth to this notion? It's a question that merges urban legend with physics, legality, and public safety. In this article, we'll unpack the supposedly lethal penny's science, explore real-life experiments and studies, and discuss the legal and safety considerations of dropping any object from such heights. As we delve into this topic, we'll uncover what happens if someone drops a penny off the Empire State Building. The perception that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could be lethal is based on the idea that an object falling from such a height would accumulate extraordinary speed, making it deadly upon impact. However, this idea doesn't hold up when we consider the principles of physics, specifically the interplay between gravity, terminal velocity, and the specific characteristics of the penny itself. When any object is dropped from a height, it initially starts with a speed of zero, then accelerates downwards due to the force of gravity. Without air resistance, all objects, irrespective of their mass, would continue accelerating at around 9.8 m/s\u00b2 until they hit the ground. However, our world is filled with air, which drastically changes the picture. The penny, as it falls, collides with air molecules. These collisions create a drag force that opposes the penny's downward motion. As the penny picks up speed, the drag force increases until it equals the force of gravity acting on the penny. At this point, the penny no longer accelerates and continues to fall at a constant speed called terminal velocity. The terminal velocity of an object depends on its shape and mass. For a small, flat object like a penny, the terminal velocity is quite low due to the relatively large surface area encountering air resistance compared to its weight. Estimates put the terminal velocity of a penny at around 50 miles per hour. Therefore, if you were to drop a penny from the Empire State Building (or any other height beyond which it could reach its terminal velocity), it would hit the ground at its terminal velocity, not at speed proportional to the height it was dropped from. At around 50 miles per hour, it might sting, but it wouldn't cause serious injury. Additionally, the design of skyscrapers often causes updrafts, which could cause the penny to be blown off course, potentially even causing it to end up higher than the starting point. In conclusion, dropping a penny from the Empire State Building is unlikely to cause damage due to its terminal velocity. However, it's still not advised because it can be a nuisance or distraction, which can be hazardous in a bustling city like New York. Contrary to popular urban legend, a penny falling from the Empire State Building or any other skyscraper won't kill a pedestrian on the ground. This myth has been propagated through various means, from casual conversations to being stated as fact in movies and television shows. In reality, physics doesn't support this claim. When an object falls through the atmosphere, two primary forces are acting on it: gravity, which pulls it downward, and air resistance, which opposes its downward motion. For a penny, its flat, thin, and lightweight characteristics contribute to a low terminal velocity \u2014 the highest speed it can achieve when falling. As mentioned, this terminal velocity is estimated to be around 50 miles per hour. A penny might sting if it hit you at this speed, but it would hardly be lethal. Several physicists and science TV shows like MythBusters have debunked this myth through calculations and practical experiments. Their findings demonstrate that even after falling from a great height like the Empire State Building, the penny would not have enough energy to inflict severe harm or cause death. However, it's important to note that while the penny itself isn't dangerous, dropping any object from a tall building can be. Even a harmless penny can startle or distract someone, potentially leading to hazardous situations in a busy city environment. In summary, while a penny dropped from the Empire State Building won't kill you, keeping all objects, no matter how small or seemingly harmless, from free-falling off tall structures is best. Not because of the potential physical harm they could inflict but due to the potential for distraction and surprise they could cause in the bustling city life below. Over the years, numerous individuals and organizations have tested the lethal penny myth in real-life scenarios to debunk it. Here are a few notable experiments and studies conducted: MythBusters: In one of their episodes, the MythBusters team recreated the scenario by dropping a penny from a height equivalent to that of the Empire State Building. Using a wind tunnel and a high-speed camera, they determined that a penny reaches its terminal velocity of about 50 miles per hour. When they fired a penny at this speed into a skull analog, it bounced off, debunking the myth that a penny dropped from a great height could kill a pedestrian. Scientific American: Similarly, Scientific American conducted a theoretical study. They, too, concluded that the terminal velocity\n\nquestion: What happens when a penny is dropped from a height beyond which it could reach its terminal velocity?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "It would hit the ground at its terminal velocity, not at a speed proportional to the height it was dropped from.

Purdue University Study: Physicist Louis Bloomfield from the University of Virginia experimented and found that the maximum speed a penny could reach was 30 to 50 miles per hour - not nearly fast enough to kill or seriously injure anyone. Bloomfield further explained that the penny's shape and mass prevent it from becoming a deadly projectile. Each of these experiments concluded that contrary to popular belief, a penny dropped from the height of the Empire State Building is not deadly. While it's not advised (or legal) to throw objects from tall buildings due to potential unintended consequences, fears of lethal pennies can be laid to rest. So what would happen if someone dropped a penny from the top of the Empire State Building? Simply put, it would fall to the ground, but it wouldn't cause the catastrophic damage popular myth might have you believe. As we've established, a penny can only reach a terminal velocity of around 50 miles per hour due to its shape and mass. When it eventually hits the ground, or perhaps an unfortunate passerby, it wouldn't travel fast enough to cause serious harm. At most, getting hit by such a penny might feel like being flicked, not pleasant by any means, but far from deadly. Additionally, the urban environment surrounding the Empire State Building would influence the coin's descent. The wind could carry the penny off course, and the various skyscrapers could act as barriers. It's also worth noting that the Empire State Building observation decks are enclosed by tall fences specifically designed to prevent objects from being dropped. So, while it's an intriguing thought experiment, the reality is relatively mundane and much safer. The danger of a penny dropped from the Empire State Building is an enduring urban myth. A penny dropped from the Empire State Building can cause serious harm, so it's crucial to highlight the importance of safety and legality. Regardless of the physics involved, throwing objects off tall buildings is dangerous and illegal. While a penny may not have the capacity to kill, it could startle pedestrians, possibly causing accidents or triggering panic. Objects with more mass or aerodynamic shape can become lethal projectiles when dropped from significant heights. Legally, dropping objects from tall buildings like the Empire State Building is considered reckless endangerment and is punishable by law. The exact consequences can vary, but they may include hefty fines, imprisonment, or both. This rule isn't limited to just coins but applies to any objects that could harm individuals or property. Moreover, buildings like the Empire State Building have strict safety regulations, including protective barriers around observation decks to prevent such incidents.

It was a common piece of information that was spread across the playground. It is such a common urban legend that most of my other informants and I, too, have heard the same declaration. From when she was younger, her general understanding is that when dropped from the top balcony of the Empire State Building, the penny will gradually increase in velocity. As it gets closer to the ground, it will reach the speed of a bullet. If by chance the penny strikes a person in the head, the penny will go straight through and kill the person. She also says that there are variations of the legend: it will put a hole in the cement sidewalk, the coin will break to pieces, and even, that it has been used to purposefully kill someone. She laughed when she said the last variant saying: \u201cI have no idea how or why someone would strategically plan to kill someone with a penny\u2026 on the top of the Empire State Building. You wouldn\u2019t even be able to identify the right person from that high up!  \u2026I don\u2019t know, it was just something I heard from grade school.\u201d My informant told me that she remembered this \u201cfact\u201d so well that when she actually went to New York when she was in high school, she asked one of the tour guides if it had ever happened: \u201cThe guide told me that he got that one a lot, but he reassured me that it wasn\u2019t even possible. Supposedly, since the building is so tall, the updraft will slow the penny\u2019s speed as it falls and won\u2019t cause any damage. He also said, though, that people have thrown pennies off the side in the past, but they end up landing on other terraces on the lower floors.\u201d After hearing this, I was curious and did a little more research. After checking a few different sources, it turns out the urban legend is in fact completely false. According to the book Empire State Building, a penny tossed from the top of the Empire State Building will never even hit the ground. The updraft effect pushes falling objects against the building and end up falling only a few stories below. The coins that are dropped from the 86th floor simply land on the 80th floor and are collected by electricians when they change the lights on the outer side of the building. Furthermore, according to an experiment that was performed for the ABC show \u201c20/20,\u201d even if the pennies dodge the 80th floor landing, the pennies are still harmless to pedestrians below. After sending a large weather balloon into the air with an attached penny dispenser, Louis Bloomberg \u2013 a University of Virginia physics professor \u2013 spit the pennies one by one through a remote control device. Several pennies hit Bloomberg but \u201cit was like getting hit by a bug\u2026it was noticeable, but nothing more\u2026these things are just fluttering down.\u201d Another experiment was performed on the show \u201cMythbusters\u201d that tested the degree of impact at terminal velocity (the speed at which the penny would fall if no other factors such as friction acted upon the coin) on asphalt, cement, concrete and an anatomically correct human head replica. The experiment revealed that the penny would not penetrate any surfaces. As far as the human skull, a penny at terminal velocity may break the skin, but will not break through or fracture the skull. So as the crew of Mythbusters would say, this urban legend is \u201cbusted!\u201d Hyneman, Jamie, and Adam Savage. \u201cMythbusters: Penny Drop MiniMyth.\u201d Mythbusters.

Hopefully, any worries one might have of being killed by a falling penny as they stroll by tall buildings in New York will be quelled. After all, people are usually not injured by hail falling from the clouds. We will apply Newton's laws of motion to two cases. At first we will neglect air resistance (drag) so we can solve the problem analytically. Then we will use a simple model of drag to show how the penny reaches a terminal velocity and how this dramatically affects the impact velocity of the penny on the ground. When the only force acting on a body as it falls toward another body, similar to an apple falling to the Earth, is gravity then we say the body is in free fall. The only way we can do this is if we neglet things like drag caused by the atmosphere, wind or variations in The Gravitational Field. This situation is depicted in Figure 1, where the force due to gravity is F = \u2212 m g {\\displaystyle F=-mg} \\includegraphics{FreeFallAcceleration.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 1:} Penny falling from Empire State Building The two things we want to calculate is the velocity of the penny when it impacts the ground and the time it takes the penny to fall. Applying Newton's second law to the penny F = m a {\\displaystyle F=ma} yields the acceleration of the penny in the y direction a ( t ) = F m = \u2212 m g m = \u2212 g. {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {F}{m}}=-{\\frac {mg}{m}}=-g\\,.} Notice that the minus sign comes from the coordinate system choice with the y axis pointing up. Next, integrate the acceleration equation to get the velocity of the penny at a given time. Remember that the acceleration is defined as a = d v d t. {\\displaystyle a={\\frac {dv}{dt}}.} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d v = \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=-\\int gdt.} Integrate to get v ( t ) = \u2212 g t + C. {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt+C.} The constant is found using initial conditions, so at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, the velocity of the penny is zero v ( 0 ) = 0 = \u2212 g ( 0 ) + C. {\\displaystyle v(0)=0=-g(0)+C.} This is only true if C is also zero, therefore the velocity equation is v ( t ) = \u2212 g t {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt} Well, this is great, we can find the velocity at any given time. However, we do not know the time of the impact. For this we must integrate (1) to get the position of the penny. Remember, that velocity is defined as v = d x d t {\\displaystyle v={\\frac {dx}{dt}}} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d x = \u2212 \u222b g t d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dx=-\\int gtdt.} Integrate to get x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + C. {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+C.} Once again, the constant is found from the initial condition, at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, x ( 0 ) = h {\\displaystyle x(0)=h}. Therefore, the position equation is x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + h {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+h} What we want is the time of impact. This happens when x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0}.

In the next section we will model air resistance to capture this effect. Since the penny is traveling through the atmosphere (a fluid), we need to use some basic results from fluid mechanics to model the drag force acting on the penny. A simple model combined with experimental data results in the drag expression F d = 1 2 C d \u03c1 A v 2 {\\displaystyle F_{d}={\\frac {1}{2}}C_{d}\\rho Av^{2}} where C d {\\displaystyle C_{d}} is the drag coefficient of the penny. It is an experimantly derived value and here we will use the value given by, C d = 1.17. {\\displaystyle C_{d}=1.17.} The drag force is in the opposite direction of the velocity vector as shown in the free body diagram in Figure 2. \\includegraphics{FreeBodyDiagram.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 2:} Free Body Diagram The density we will use is the standard day value at sea level given in the tables from, \u03c1 = 1.225  {\\displaystyle \\rho =1.225\\,\\,} Next A {\\displaystyle A}, is the effective cross-sectional area of the penny, From Wikipedia, the diameter of the US penny is D = 19.05  = 1.905 \u00d7 10 \u2212 2  {\\displaystyle D=19.05\\,\\,=1.905\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\,} So the cross-sectional area is then A = \u03c0 r 2 = \u03c0 D 2 4 = 0.000286 m 2 {\\displaystyle A=\\pi r^{2}=\\pi {\\frac {D^{2}}{4}}=0.000286m^{2}} Combining all these constants gives us the drag force that is proportional to the square of the velocity F d = 0.0002 v 2. {\\displaystyle F_{d}=0.0002v^{2}.} Now we have 2 forces to use with Newton's second law, this gives the acceleration equation as a ( t ) = 0.0002 v 2 m \u2212 g {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}-g} The integral setup is then \u222b d v = \u222b 0.0002 v 2 m d t \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=\\int {\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}dt-\\int gdt.} Unlike the free fall example, the analytical solution is a litte more difficult. However, all is not lost. We will first turn to numerical methods such as Euler's method or numerical programs such as Matlab, Octave or Maple and then later compare with analytical solution (coming soon). Here we will solve the differential equation using Octave. First a little setup must be done to use Octave's lsode solver. The differential equation of motion that we will solve with the mass of the penny, m = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3  {\\displaystyle m=2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\,}  d 2 x d t 2 = 0.0817 ( d x d t ) 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}}=0.0817\\left({\\frac {dx}{dt}}\\right)^{2}-9.8} We cannot use a 2nd order differential equation in lsode, so we must use two 1st order equations. This is done by using two states, one for position and another for velocity.

In the story, the penny falls and kills a pedestrian on the sidewalk below. This is one of those classic urban legends that is untrue but contains a grain of truth. Advertisement Throwing a penny off the Empire State Building wouldn't kill someone. A penny only weighs about a gram and it tumbles as it falls. Even though this is one of the tallest buildings in the world because of the tumbling and the light weight, there's so much air resistance that the penny never really gathers that much speed before it hits its terminal velocity. A gram of weight traveling at a relatively slow speed might hurt a little if it hit you on the head, but it's not going to kill you. The grain of truth embedded in this urban legend is the fact that falling objects -- even ones that seem harmless -- can do a lot of damage. That's why people on construction sites wear hard hats. If a big nut or bolt weighing 50 grams (about 1.8 ounces) falls and hits you on the head, it's going to do some serious damage, and depending on the height it falls from, it could definitely kill you if it hit right on top of your skull. To get an idea of the damage it can do, let's take a look at a bullet. A bullet might weigh 5 to 10 grams, and it leaves the barrel of a gun at anywhere from 800 to 2,000 miles per hour, depending on the type of gun, the type of bullet and the amount of powder behind the bullet. A 44-caliber bullet weighs about 9 grams. Let's assume it leaves the gun at 1,000 miles per hour. That gives it a muzzle energy of about 300 foot-pounds (1 foot-pound is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 pound 1 foot in the air). Three-hundred foot-pounds of energy is clearly enough to kill someone. Even a third of that is enough to kill someone. A 1-gram penny falling from the Empire State Building might reach 100 miles per hour. It has a little less than 1 foot-pound of energy when it hits, and just hurts a little. If a 50-gram nut, or a roll of pennies weighing 50 grams, were to fall from the Empire State Building, it would fall about 1,000 feet. Ignoring air resistance, it would reach a velocity of about 250 miles per hour. That gives it energy of about 100 foot-pounds, which is fatal if it hits you on the head. If you're wearing a hard hat, however, you'll survive.

But is there any truth to this notion? It's a question that merges urban legend with physics, legality, and public safety. In this article, we'll unpack the supposedly lethal penny's science, explore real-life experiments and studies, and discuss the legal and safety considerations of dropping any object from such heights. As we delve into this topic, we'll uncover what happens if someone drops a penny off the Empire State Building. The perception that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could be lethal is based on the idea that an object falling from such a height would accumulate extraordinary speed, making it deadly upon impact. However, this idea doesn't hold up when we consider the principles of physics, specifically the interplay between gravity, terminal velocity, and the specific characteristics of the penny itself. When any object is dropped from a height, it initially starts with a speed of zero, then accelerates downwards due to the force of gravity. Without air resistance, all objects, irrespective of their mass, would continue accelerating at around 9.8 m/s\u00b2 until they hit the ground. However, our world is filled with air, which drastically changes the picture. The penny, as it falls, collides with air molecules. These collisions create a drag force that opposes the penny's downward motion. As the penny picks up speed, the drag force increases until it equals the force of gravity acting on the penny. At this point, the penny no longer accelerates and continues to fall at a constant speed called terminal velocity. The terminal velocity of an object depends on its shape and mass. For a small, flat object like a penny, the terminal velocity is quite low due to the relatively large surface area encountering air resistance compared to its weight. Estimates put the terminal velocity of a penny at around 50 miles per hour. Therefore, if you were to drop a penny from the Empire State Building (or any other height beyond which it could reach its terminal velocity), it would hit the ground at its terminal velocity, not at speed proportional to the height it was dropped from. At around 50 miles per hour, it might sting, but it wouldn't cause serious injury. Additionally, the design of skyscrapers often causes updrafts, which could cause the penny to be blown off course, potentially even causing it to end up higher than the starting point. In conclusion, dropping a penny from the Empire State Building is unlikely to cause damage due to its terminal velocity. However, it's still not advised because it can be a nuisance or distraction, which can be hazardous in a bustling city like New York. Contrary to popular urban legend, a penny falling from the Empire State Building or any other skyscraper won't kill a pedestrian on the ground. This myth has been propagated through various means, from casual conversations to being stated as fact in movies and television shows. In reality, physics doesn't support this claim. When an object falls through the atmosphere, two primary forces are acting on it: gravity, which pulls it downward, and air resistance, which opposes its downward motion. For a penny, its flat, thin, and lightweight characteristics contribute to a low terminal velocity \u2014 the highest speed it can achieve when falling. As mentioned, this terminal velocity is estimated to be around 50 miles per hour. A penny might sting if it hit you at this speed, but it would hardly be lethal. Several physicists and science TV shows like MythBusters have debunked this myth through calculations and practical experiments. Their findings demonstrate that even after falling from a great height like the Empire State Building, the penny would not have enough energy to inflict severe harm or cause death. However, it's important to note that while the penny itself isn't dangerous, dropping any object from a tall building can be. Even a harmless penny can startle or distract someone, potentially leading to hazardous situations in a busy city environment. In summary, while a penny dropped from the Empire State Building won't kill you, keeping all objects, no matter how small or seemingly harmless, from free-falling off tall structures is best. Not because of the potential physical harm they could inflict but due to the potential for distraction and surprise they could cause in the bustling city life below. Over the years, numerous individuals and organizations have tested the lethal penny myth in real-life scenarios to debunk it. Here are a few notable experiments and studies conducted: MythBusters: In one of their episodes, the MythBusters team recreated the scenario by dropping a penny from a height equivalent to that of the Empire State Building. Using a wind tunnel and a high-speed camera, they determined that a penny reaches its terminal velocity of about 50 miles per hour. When they fired a penny at this speed into a skull analog, it bounced off, debunking the myth that a penny dropped from a great height could kill a pedestrian. Scientific American: Similarly, Scientific American conducted a theoretical study. They, too, concluded that the terminal velocity\n\nquestion: According to the book Empire State Building, what would happen if a penny was tossed from the top of the Empire State Building?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1125}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Purdue University Study: Physicist Louis Bloomfield from the University of Virginia experimented and found that the maximum speed a penny could reach was 30 to 50 miles per hour - not nearly fast enough to kill or seriously injure anyone. Bloomfield further explained that the penny's shape and mass prevent it from becoming a deadly projectile. Each of these experiments concluded that contrary to popular belief, a penny dropped from the height of the Empire State Building is not deadly. While it's not advised (or legal) to throw objects from tall buildings due to potential unintended consequences, fears of lethal pennies can be laid to rest. So what would happen if someone dropped a penny from the top of the Empire State Building? Simply put, it would fall to the ground, but it wouldn't cause the catastrophic damage popular myth might have you believe. As we've established, a penny can only reach a terminal velocity of around 50 miles per hour due to its shape and mass. When it eventually hits the ground, or perhaps an unfortunate passerby, it wouldn't travel fast enough to cause serious harm. At most, getting hit by such a penny might feel like being flicked, not pleasant by any means, but far from deadly. Additionally, the urban environment surrounding the Empire State Building would influence the coin's descent. The wind could carry the penny off course, and the various skyscrapers could act as barriers. It's also worth noting that the Empire State Building observation decks are enclosed by tall fences specifically designed to prevent objects from being dropped. So, while it's an intriguing thought experiment, the reality is relatively mundane and much safer. The danger of a penny dropped from the Empire State Building is an enduring urban myth. A penny dropped from the Empire State Building can cause serious harm, so it's crucial to highlight the importance of safety and legality. Regardless of the physics involved, throwing objects off tall buildings is dangerous and illegal. While a penny may not have the capacity to kill, it could startle pedestrians, possibly causing accidents or triggering panic. Objects with more mass or aerodynamic shape can become lethal projectiles when dropped from significant heights. Legally, dropping objects from tall buildings like the Empire State Building is considered reckless endangerment and is punishable by law. The exact consequences can vary, but they may include hefty fines, imprisonment, or both. This rule isn't limited to just coins but applies to any objects that could harm individuals or property. Moreover, buildings like the Empire State Building have strict safety regulations, including protective barriers around observation decks to prevent such incidents.

It was a common piece of information that was spread across the playground. It is such a common urban legend that most of my other informants and I, too, have heard the same declaration. From when she was younger, her general understanding is that when dropped from the top balcony of the Empire State Building, the penny will gradually increase in velocity. As it gets closer to the ground, it will reach the speed of a bullet. If by chance the penny strikes a person in the head, the penny will go straight through and kill the person. She also says that there are variations of the legend: it will put a hole in the cement sidewalk, the coin will break to pieces, and even, that it has been used to purposefully kill someone. She laughed when she said the last variant saying: \u201cI have no idea how or why someone would strategically plan to kill someone with a penny\u2026 on the top of the Empire State Building. You wouldn\u2019t even be able to identify the right person from that high up!  \u2026I don\u2019t know, it was just something I heard from grade school.\u201d My informant told me that she remembered this \u201cfact\u201d so well that when she actually went to New York when she was in high school, she asked one of the tour guides if it had ever happened: \u201cThe guide told me that he got that one a lot, but he reassured me that it wasn\u2019t even possible. Supposedly, since the building is so tall, the updraft will slow the penny\u2019s speed as it falls and won\u2019t cause any damage. He also said, though, that people have thrown pennies off the side in the past, but they end up landing on other terraces on the lower floors.\u201d After hearing this, I was curious and did a little more research. After checking a few different sources, it turns out the urban legend is in fact completely false. According to the book Empire State Building, a penny tossed from the top of the Empire State Building will never even hit the ground. The updraft effect pushes falling objects against the building and end up falling only a few stories below. The coins that are dropped from the 86th floor simply land on the 80th floor and are collected by electricians when they change the lights on the outer side of the building. Furthermore, according to an experiment that was performed for the ABC show \u201c20/20,\u201d even if the pennies dodge the 80th floor landing, the pennies are still harmless to pedestrians below. After sending a large weather balloon into the air with an attached penny dispenser, Louis Bloomberg \u2013 a University of Virginia physics professor \u2013 spit the pennies one by one through a remote control device. Several pennies hit Bloomberg but \u201cit was like getting hit by a bug\u2026it was noticeable, but nothing more\u2026these things are just fluttering down.\u201d Another experiment was performed on the show \u201cMythbusters\u201d that tested the degree of impact at terminal velocity (the speed at which the penny would fall if no other factors such as friction acted upon the coin) on asphalt, cement, concrete and an anatomically correct human head replica. The experiment revealed that the penny would not penetrate any surfaces. As far as the human skull, a penny at terminal velocity may break the skin, but will not break through or fracture the skull. So as the crew of Mythbusters would say, this urban legend is \u201cbusted!\u201d Hyneman, Jamie, and Adam Savage. \u201cMythbusters: Penny Drop MiniMyth.\u201d Mythbusters.

Hopefully, any worries one might have of being killed by a falling penny as they stroll by tall buildings in New York will be quelled. After all, people are usually not injured by hail falling from the clouds. We will apply Newton's laws of motion to two cases. At first we will neglect air resistance (drag) so we can solve the problem analytically. Then we will use a simple model of drag to show how the penny reaches a terminal velocity and how this dramatically affects the impact velocity of the penny on the ground. When the only force acting on a body as it falls toward another body, similar to an apple falling to the Earth, is gravity then we say the body is in free fall. The only way we can do this is if we neglet things like drag caused by the atmosphere, wind or variations in The Gravitational Field. This situation is depicted in Figure 1, where the force due to gravity is F = \u2212 m g {\\displaystyle F=-mg} \\includegraphics{FreeFallAcceleration.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 1:} Penny falling from Empire State Building The two things we want to calculate is the velocity of the penny when it impacts the ground and the time it takes the penny to fall. Applying Newton's second law to the penny F = m a {\\displaystyle F=ma} yields the acceleration of the penny in the y direction a ( t ) = F m = \u2212 m g m = \u2212 g. {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {F}{m}}=-{\\frac {mg}{m}}=-g\\,.} Notice that the minus sign comes from the coordinate system choice with the y axis pointing up. Next, integrate the acceleration equation to get the velocity of the penny at a given time. Remember that the acceleration is defined as a = d v d t. {\\displaystyle a={\\frac {dv}{dt}}.} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d v = \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=-\\int gdt.} Integrate to get v ( t ) = \u2212 g t + C. {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt+C.} The constant is found using initial conditions, so at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, the velocity of the penny is zero v ( 0 ) = 0 = \u2212 g ( 0 ) + C. {\\displaystyle v(0)=0=-g(0)+C.} This is only true if C is also zero, therefore the velocity equation is v ( t ) = \u2212 g t {\\displaystyle v(t)=-gt} Well, this is great, we can find the velocity at any given time. However, we do not know the time of the impact. For this we must integrate (1) to get the position of the penny. Remember, that velocity is defined as v = d x d t {\\displaystyle v={\\frac {dx}{dt}}} This leads to the integration setup of \u222b d x = \u2212 \u222b g t d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dx=-\\int gtdt.} Integrate to get x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + C. {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+C.} Once again, the constant is found from the initial condition, at t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0}, x ( 0 ) = h {\\displaystyle x(0)=h}. Therefore, the position equation is x ( t ) = \u2212 1 2 g t 2 + h {\\displaystyle x(t)=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2}+h} What we want is the time of impact. This happens when x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0}. So solve (2) for t {\\displaystyle t}. 0 = \u2212 1 2 g t f 2 + h. {\\displaystyle 0=-{\\frac {1}{2}}gt_{f}^{2}+h.} Rearrange to get t f = 2 h g {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {2h}{g}}}} Evaluate (3), using the value g = 9.8 {\\displaystyle g=9.8}, to get t f = ( 2 ) \u2217 ( 381 ) 9.8 {\\displaystyle t_{f}={\\sqrt {\\frac {(2)*(381)}{9.8}}}} t f = 8.82 . {\\displaystyle t_{f}=8.82\\,\\,.} Finally, we get the velocity at impact by substituting (3) into (1) v ( t f ) = \u2212 g 2 h g. {\\displaystyle v(t_{f})=-g{\\sqrt {\\\n\nquestion: According to the book Empire State Building, what would happen if a penny was tossed from the top of the Empire State Building?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1131}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In the next section we will model air resistance to capture this effect. Since the penny is traveling through the atmosphere (a fluid), we need to use some basic results from fluid mechanics to model the drag force acting on the penny. A simple model combined with experimental data results in the drag expression F d = 1 2 C d \u03c1 A v 2 {\\displaystyle F_{d}={\\frac {1}{2}}C_{d}\\rho Av^{2}} where C d {\\displaystyle C_{d}} is the drag coefficient of the penny. It is an experimantly derived value and here we will use the value given by, C d = 1.17. {\\displaystyle C_{d}=1.17.} The drag force is in the opposite direction of the velocity vector as shown in the free body diagram in Figure 2. \\includegraphics{FreeBodyDiagram.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 2:} Free Body Diagram The density we will use is the standard day value at sea level given in the tables from, \u03c1 = 1.225  {\\displaystyle \\rho =1.225\\,\\,} Next A {\\displaystyle A}, is the effective cross-sectional area of the penny, From Wikipedia, the diameter of the US penny is D = 19.05  = 1.905 \u00d7 10 \u2212 2  {\\displaystyle D=19.05\\,\\,=1.905\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\,} So the cross-sectional area is then A = \u03c0 r 2 = \u03c0 D 2 4 = 0.000286 m 2 {\\displaystyle A=\\pi r^{2}=\\pi {\\frac {D^{2}}{4}}=0.000286m^{2}} Combining all these constants gives us the drag force that is proportional to the square of the velocity F d = 0.0002 v 2. {\\displaystyle F_{d}=0.0002v^{2}.} Now we have 2 forces to use with Newton's second law, this gives the acceleration equation as a ( t ) = 0.0002 v 2 m \u2212 g {\\displaystyle a(t)={\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}-g} The integral setup is then \u222b d v = \u222b 0.0002 v 2 m d t \u2212 \u222b g d t. {\\displaystyle \\int dv=\\int {\\frac {0.0002v^{2}}{m}}dt-\\int gdt.} Unlike the free fall example, the analytical solution is a litte more difficult. However, all is not lost. We will first turn to numerical methods such as Euler's method or numerical programs such as Matlab, Octave or Maple and then later compare with analytical solution (coming soon). Here we will solve the differential equation using Octave. First a little setup must be done to use Octave's lsode solver. The differential equation of motion that we will solve with the mass of the penny, m = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3  {\\displaystyle m=2.5\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\,}  d 2 x d t 2 = 0.0817 ( d x d t ) 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}}=0.0817\\left({\\frac {dx}{dt}}\\right)^{2}-9.8} We cannot use a 2nd order differential equation in lsode, so we must use two 1st order equations. This is done by using two states, one for position and another for velocity. Then our equations of motion become y \u02d9 = y \u02d9 {\\displaystyle {\\dot {y}}={\\dot {y}}} y \u00a8 = 0.0817 y \u02d9 2 \u2212 9.8 {\\displaystyle {\\ddot {y}}=0.0817{\\dot {y}}^{2}-9.8} The commands in octave are t = lines\n\nquestion: According to the book Empire State Building, what would happen if a penny was tossed from the top of the Empire State Building?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1139}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The results are displayed in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5. \\includegraphics{figure1.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 3:} Penny's Velocity Note how the max velocity is now a measly \u2212 10.952  {\\displaystyle -10.952\\,\\,} and that it stays constant for quite awhile up until impact. This is because the penny reaches what is called terminal velocity where the upward drag force at the terminal velocity cancels out the gravitational force, 0.0817 v t 2 = g {\\displaystyle 0.0817v_{t}^{2}=g} v t = g 0.0817 = 10.952 . {\\displaystyle v_{t}={\\sqrt {\\frac {g}{0.0817}}}=10.952\\,\\,.} Figure 2 is a plot of the position and upon further inspection we see impact occurs at t f = 35.36  {\\displaystyle t_{f}=35.36\\,\\,} and the impact velocity is the terminal velocity v ( t f ) = \u2212 10.952 . {\\displaystyle v(t_{f})=-10.952\\,\\,.} \\includegraphics{figure2.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 4:} Penny's Position Finally, we will zoom in on the first few seconds of the fall to see the position before terminal velocity is reached. \\includegraphics{figure3.eps} {\\mathbf Figure 5:} First Few Seconds So to wrap things up, we see that air resistance makes a dramatic difference in the maximum velocity of the penny and the time of impact. In reality, the motion is a little more complicated due to winds and the fact that the penny will tumble, but understanding how a falling object reaches terminal velocity is something to take away.
