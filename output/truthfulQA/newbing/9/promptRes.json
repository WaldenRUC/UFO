They change color by changing the arrangement of certain skin cells called iridophores. These cells have nanocrystals that reflect light of different wavelengths, depending on their physical orientation. The color-changing ability of chameleons has always intrigued human beings. We often think about how cool and easy life would be if we could change our colors, blend in with our surroundings, and camouflage ourselves just like a chameleon can. It would definitely help us escape from awkward situations more easily! Recommended Video for you:Chameleon Chromatics: How They Change Color and Why Recommended Video for you: Unlike octopuses and cuttlefish, who change color by moving around the pigment in their cells, chameleons have specialized cells called iridophores that do the job for them. A 2015 study published in Nature Communications looked at how five adult male, four adult female, and four juvenile panther chameleons changed their colors. They found that chameleons have two layers of these iridescent cells\u2014iridophores. These iridophores have pigments and nanocrystals within them that reflect light of different wavelengths. The chameleon changes its color by exciting or relaxing its skin, changing the density of the upper layer of iridophores. A chameleon\u2019s skin has a few different cell types that contribute to its color. The uppermost layer is composed of cells that contain a yellow pigment\u2014xanthophores\u2014and those that have red pigment\u2014erythrophores\u2014which are mainly present in striped regions. Under this layer lies the iridophores, which reflect different wavelengths of light depending on how they are packed and ordered. Finally, the last layer is composed of melanophores. These melanophores have extensions that reach the uppermost layer of the skin. When a chameleon is in a relaxed state, the nanocrystals in the skin are closer to each other and they reflect shorter wavelengths, like blue. When a chameleon is excited, the distance between nanocrystals increases and they reflect longer wavelengths, such as red, orange and yellow. These colors are seen most vividly in striped bands across the chameleon\u2019s body. A chameleon\u2019s green color is the result of yellow and blue wavelengths. The yellow from the xanthophores, plus the blue light reflected from the iridophores, results in the color green. In the relaxed, neutral state, the green is light and vibrant. When in a suppressed mood, such as when it needs to hide, the chameleon turns to darker shades, sometimes turning a dark brown. This is due to the melanophores dispersing pigment to the upper layers through their extension. Also Read: Can An Octopus Change The Way It Looks? Chameleons don\u2019t change their color for camouflage, as most people think. They can\u2019t perfectly match your crazy pink curtains or blend into your blue couch. As much as Pascal from Disney\u2019s Tangled might change his colors on whim, alas, that is fiction for real chameleons, although their skin color does serve some camouflaging purposes. Chameleons spend most of their time in trees, high up amidst the brown branches and green leaves. Their own green and brown hues do allow them to blend into the leafy background, but their ability to change color isn\u2019t intended for that. Chameleons, as recent research has found, change color for two main reasons\u2014to communicate and to control their temperature. Animals have evolved different ways to communicate with one another. Humans primarily use language, fireflies use light, and chameleons use color. The chameleon\u2019s color change can indicate its mood. An angry chameleon will have a darker color, whereas a chameleon in a relaxed mood will have a lighter color. A 2013 study looked at the coloration in male chameleons during competition with other males. The researchers reported that different coloration patterns in different body regions sent different signals to their competitors. Males with a darker head were more likely to win fights, while those with brighter stripes were more likely to approach their opponent first during the competition. This is mainly something that male chameleons do. Males might change their color to attract a mate. A male chameleon will switch to lighter hues to show the female how healthy and sexy he is, or he might darken his color if he sees another male. A chameleon, upon seeing a rival, changes its color to darker shades in order to assert dominance. Female chameleons also have color-changing abilities, but they are limited. They\u2019re rather dull-colored in comparison to their male counterparts. The other reason some chameleons change their colors is the temperature. A cold chameleon will turn dark to absorb more\n\nquestion: What are iridophores?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "These cells have nanocrystals that reflect light of different wavelengths, depending on their physical orientation.", "usage": 1089}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

For example, the panther chameleon is found in open, dry environments like those of Yemen. The iridophores present in these chameleons help decrease the absorption of sunlight, which is crucial for survival. A study published in 1993 found that a dark coloration was frequently present in the morning time. The researchers concluded that this could serve to reduce basking time for chameleons. Color change in chameleons and other animals still isn\u2019t fully understood. The range of occasions for which chameleons adapt their colors is still being outlined. The more exciting question seems to be how such color-changing evolved in the first place. From complex nanocrystal lattices to pigment dispersal in the blink of an eye, the intricate ways that animals change color is stunning, fascinating and downright magical!

As BBC News\u2019 Jonathan Webb reports, reptiles are known to shift hues by two means. Warm and dark colors come from adjusting the dispersal of dark or light pigment in cells within skin layers; blues and whites, on the other hand, deemed \u201cstructural colors,\u201d emerge \u201cfrom light bouncing off physical elements\u201d in their skin. Chameleons can adjust some skin pigments to appear lighter or darker. But until recently, scientists assumed the same sort of process was happening when the animals radically adjust their appearance into bright colors, like reds and yellows. Not so, argues the study, out this week in the journal Nature Communications. In observing and dissecting panther chameleons, the team of Swiss scientists found that the animals have \u201ctwo superposed thick layers of iridophore cells\u2014iridescent cells that have pigment and reflect light,\u201d reports NBC News. Within these iridophore cells are a variety of nanocrystals that work together, according to the study\u2019s lead author, Michel Milinkovitch, \u201cas a selective mirror\u201d. A chameleon can adjust the wavelengths of light reflected in these tiny crystals by either tightening or relaxing their skin, which changes the spacing of the cells. \u201cLight will go through except for very specific wavelengths,\u201d Milinkovitch told BBC. \u201cIf the distance between the layers is small, it reflects small wavelengths, like blue; if the distance is large it reflects larger wavelengths - for example, red.\u201d The team watched this process in both live animals and in samples of chameleon skin. When they tensed the skin by drying it up, they saw the same drastic change in color apparent in live panther chameleons confronting, for example, a male competitor. The study also found that beneath the lattice of crystals was a deeper skin layer that reflects near-infrared light, which likely helps the lizard to stay cool in the heat of the sun. As Webb points out, the combination of color changing crystals and a reflective skin layer appears to be unique to chameleons; other lizards just have one or the other. And here\u2019s a little bit of chameleon trivia: the animals\u2019 radical color changes (which can take minutes to fully unfold) aren\u2019t performed to blend in with their surroundings as children\u2019s books might have us believe; rather, they change outfits to communicate to other lizards and to react to temperature or mood. And not all chameleons can go Technicolor\u2014some can only range from green, brown and gray. But panther chameleons, found in Madagascar and the focus of this study, can exhibit exotic blues, yellows, greens and reds. And now we can thank crystals for the show.

Wonder of the Day #651 SCIENCE \u2014 Life Science Today\u2019s Wonder of the Day was inspired by Lorilynn. Lorilynn Wonders, \u201cWhy do chameleons change colors\u201d Thanks for WONDERing with us, Lorilynn! Did you ever just wish you could blend into the background? Perhaps you forgot to read all of your homework assignment and the teacher calls on you. Wouldn't it be great if you could make yourself look like a desk and chair? If you're a fan of lizards, you probably already know that there are some types of lizards \u2014 called chameleons \u2014 that can change their color. Have you ever wondered why \u2014 and how \u2014 they can do this? Chameleons are lizards that are part of the scientific family called Chamaeleonidae. In addition to the ability to change color, chameleons have many other characteristics that make them special, including parrot-like feet, eyes that can look in two different directions at once and long tongues and tails. Chameleons come in many colors, such as pink, blue, orange, red, yellow, green and turquoise. They can be found in Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. There are about 160 different species of chameleons, and they can live in both rain forests and deserts. Many people believe chameleons change colors to disguise themselves and hide from predators. However, chameleons are very fast \u2014 many can run up to 21 miles per hour \u2014 and can avoid most predators quite easily. Camouflage is thus only a secondary reason why most chameleons change color. So why would they want to change colors? Scientists believe that chameleons change color to reflect their moods. By doing so, they send social signals to other chameleons. For example, darker colors tend to mean a chameleon is angry. Lighter colors might be used to attract mates. Some chameleons also change colors to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature or light. For example, a chameleon that gets cold might change to a darker color to absorb more heat and warm its body. For many years, scientists believed that chameleons change their color by manipulating specialized cells \u2014 called chromatophores \u2014 that contain different colors of pigment. For example, when a chameleon wants to convey a particular mood or message, its brain sends a message to its chromatophores, which then move pigments around to change the chameleon's color. Today, researchers believe that pigments aren't the only mechanism chameleons use to change their colors. While pigments can account for warmer tones, such as greens, they can't explain brighter tones, such as reds and yellows. Recent studies have shown that chameleons also have a special layer of cells \u2014 called iridophores \u2014 under their skin. These special cells, which contain pigment and reflect light, are made up of hundreds of thousands of guanine crystals. Chameleons can relax or excite their skin, causing these special cells to move and change structure. Researchers found that, when this happens, these cells act like prisms, reflecting different wavelengths of light to create the variety of tones we see.

They change color by changing the arrangement of certain skin cells called iridophores. These cells have nanocrystals that reflect light of different wavelengths, depending on their physical orientation. The color-changing ability of chameleons has always intrigued human beings. We often think about how cool and easy life would be if we could change our colors, blend in with our surroundings, and camouflage ourselves just like a chameleon can. It would definitely help us escape from awkward situations more easily! Recommended Video for you:Chameleon Chromatics: How They Change Color and Why Recommended Video for you: Unlike octopuses and cuttlefish, who change color by moving around the pigment in their cells, chameleons have specialized cells called iridophores that do the job for them. A 2015 study published in Nature Communications looked at how five adult male, four adult female, and four juvenile panther chameleons changed their colors. They found that chameleons have two layers of these iridescent cells\u2014iridophores. These iridophores have pigments and nanocrystals within them that reflect light of different wavelengths. The chameleon changes its color by exciting or relaxing its skin, changing the density of the upper layer of iridophores. A chameleon\u2019s skin has a few different cell types that contribute to its color. The uppermost layer is composed of cells that contain a yellow pigment\u2014xanthophores\u2014and those that have red pigment\u2014erythrophores\u2014which are mainly present in striped regions. Under this layer lies the iridophores, which reflect different wavelengths of light depending on how they are packed and ordered. Finally, the last layer is composed of melanophores. These melanophores have extensions that reach the uppermost layer of the skin. When a chameleon is in a relaxed state, the nanocrystals in the skin are closer to each other and they reflect shorter wavelengths, like blue. When a chameleon is excited, the distance between nanocrystals increases and they reflect longer wavelengths, such as red, orange and yellow. These colors are seen most vividly in striped bands across the chameleon\u2019s body. A chameleon\u2019s green color is the result of yellow and blue wavelengths. The yellow from the xanthophores, plus the blue light reflected from the iridophores, results in the color green. In the relaxed, neutral state, the green is light and vibrant. When in a suppressed mood, such as when it needs to hide, the chameleon turns to darker shades, sometimes turning a dark brown. This is due to the melanophores dispersing pigment to the upper layers through their extension. Also Read: Can An Octopus Change The Way It Looks? Chameleons don\u2019t change their color for camouflage, as most people think. They can\u2019t perfectly match your crazy pink curtains or blend into your blue couch. As much as Pascal from Disney\u2019s Tangled might change his colors on whim, alas, that is fiction for real chameleons, although their skin color does serve some camouflaging purposes. Chameleons spend most of their time in trees, high up amidst the brown branches and green leaves. Their own green and brown hues do allow them to blend into the leafy background, but their ability to change color isn\u2019t intended for that. Chameleons, as recent research has found, change color for two main reasons\u2014to communicate and to control their temperature. Animals have evolved different ways to communicate with one another. Humans primarily use language, fireflies use light, and chameleons use color. The chameleon\u2019s color change can indicate its mood. An angry chameleon will have a darker color, whereas a chameleon in a relaxed mood will have a lighter color. A 2013 study looked at the coloration in male chameleons during competition with other males. The researchers reported that different coloration patterns in different body regions sent different signals to their competitors. Males with a darker head were more likely to win fights, while those with brighter stripes were more likely to approach their opponent first during the competition. This is mainly something that male chameleons do. Males might change their color to attract a mate. A male chameleon will switch to lighter hues to show the female how healthy and sexy he is, or he might darken his color if he sees another male. A chameleon, upon seeing a rival, changes its color to darker shades in order to assert dominance. Female chameleons also have color-changing abilities, but they are limited. They\u2019re rather dull-colored in comparison to their male counterparts. The other reason some chameleons change their colors is the temperature. A cold chameleon will turn dark to absorb more\n\nquestion: What happens to the nanocrystals in the skin when a chameleon is in a relaxed state?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The nanocrystals in the skin are closer together and reflect shorter wavelengths, like blue.", "usage": 1101}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

For example, the panther chameleon is found in open, dry environments like those of Yemen. The iridophores present in these chameleons help decrease the absorption of sunlight, which is crucial for survival. A study published in 1993 found that a dark coloration was frequently present in the morning time. The researchers concluded that this could serve to reduce basking time for chameleons. Color change in chameleons and other animals still isn\u2019t fully understood. The range of occasions for which chameleons adapt their colors is still being outlined. The more exciting question seems to be how such color-changing evolved in the first place. From complex nanocrystal lattices to pigment dispersal in the blink of an eye, the intricate ways that animals change color is stunning, fascinating and downright magical!

As BBC News\u2019 Jonathan Webb reports, reptiles are known to shift hues by two means. Warm and dark colors come from adjusting the dispersal of dark or light pigment in cells within skin layers; blues and whites, on the other hand, deemed \u201cstructural colors,\u201d emerge \u201cfrom light bouncing off physical elements\u201d in their skin. Chameleons can adjust some skin pigments to appear lighter or darker. But until recently, scientists assumed the same sort of process was happening when the animals radically adjust their appearance into bright colors, like reds and yellows. Not so, argues the study, out this week in the journal Nature Communications. In observing and dissecting panther chameleons, the team of Swiss scientists found that the animals have \u201ctwo superposed thick layers of iridophore cells\u2014iridescent cells that have pigment and reflect light,\u201d reports NBC News. Within these iridophore cells are a variety of nanocrystals that work together, according to the study\u2019s lead author, Michel Milinkovitch, \u201cas a selective mirror\u201d. A chameleon can adjust the wavelengths of light reflected in these tiny crystals by either tightening or relaxing their skin, which changes the spacing of the cells. \u201cLight will go through except for very specific wavelengths,\u201d Milinkovitch told BBC. \u201cIf the distance between the layers is small, it reflects small wavelengths, like blue; if the distance is large it reflects larger wavelengths - for example, red.\u201d The team watched this process in both live animals and in samples of chameleon skin. When they tensed the skin by drying it up, they saw the same drastic change in color apparent in live panther chameleons confronting, for example, a male competitor. The study also found that beneath the lattice of crystals was a deeper skin layer that reflects near-infrared light, which likely helps the lizard to stay cool in the heat of the sun. As Webb points out, the combination of color changing crystals and a reflective skin layer appears to be unique to chameleons; other lizards just have one or the other. And here\u2019s a little bit of chameleon trivia: the animals\u2019 radical color changes (which can take minutes to fully unfold) aren\u2019t performed to blend in with their surroundings as children\u2019s books might have us believe; rather, they change outfits to communicate to other lizards and to react to temperature or mood. And not all chameleons can go Technicolor\u2014some can only range from green, brown and gray. But panther chameleons, found in Madagascar and the focus of this study, can exhibit exotic blues, yellows, greens and reds. And now we can thank crystals for the show.

Wonder of the Day #651 SCIENCE \u2014 Life Science Today\u2019s Wonder of the Day was inspired by Lorilynn. Lorilynn Wonders, \u201cWhy do chameleons change colors\u201d Thanks for WONDERing with us, Lorilynn! Did you ever just wish you could blend into the background? Perhaps you forgot to read all of your homework assignment and the teacher calls on you. Wouldn't it be great if you could make yourself look like a desk and chair? If you're a fan of lizards, you probably already know that there are some types of lizards \u2014 called chameleons \u2014 that can change their color. Have you ever wondered why \u2014 and how \u2014 they can do this? Chameleons are lizards that are part of the scientific family called Chamaeleonidae. In addition to the ability to change color, chameleons have many other characteristics that make them special, including parrot-like feet, eyes that can look in two different directions at once and long tongues and tails. Chameleons come in many colors, such as pink, blue, orange, red, yellow, green and turquoise. They can be found in Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. There are about 160 different species of chameleons, and they can live in both rain forests and deserts. Many people believe chameleons change colors to disguise themselves and hide from predators. However, chameleons are very fast \u2014 many can run up to 21 miles per hour \u2014 and can avoid most predators quite easily. Camouflage is thus only a secondary reason why most chameleons change color. So why would they want to change colors? Scientists believe that chameleons change color to reflect their moods. By doing so, they send social signals to other chameleons. For example, darker colors tend to mean a chameleon is angry. Lighter colors might be used to attract mates. Some chameleons also change colors to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature or light. For example, a chameleon that gets cold might change to a darker color to absorb more heat and warm its body. For many years, scientists believed that chameleons change their color by manipulating specialized cells \u2014 called chromatophores \u2014 that contain different colors of pigment. For example, when a chameleon wants to convey a particular mood or message, its brain sends a message to its chromatophores, which then move pigments around to change the chameleon's color. Today, researchers believe that pigments aren't the only mechanism chameleons use to change their colors. While pigments can account for warmer tones, such as greens, they can't explain brighter tones, such as reds and yellows. Recent studies have shown that chameleons also have a special layer of cells \u2014 called iridophores \u2014 under their skin. These special cells, which contain pigment and reflect light, are made up of hundreds of thousands of guanine crystals. Chameleons can relax or excite their skin, causing these special cells to move and change structure. Researchers found that, when this happens, these cells act like prisms, reflecting different wavelengths of light to create the variety of tones we see.

They change color by changing the arrangement of certain skin cells called iridophores. These cells have nanocrystals that reflect light of different wavelengths, depending on their physical orientation. The color-changing ability of chameleons has always intrigued human beings. We often think about how cool and easy life would be if we could change our colors, blend in with our surroundings, and camouflage ourselves just like a chameleon can. It would definitely help us escape from awkward situations more easily! Recommended Video for you:Chameleon Chromatics: How They Change Color and Why Recommended Video for you: Unlike octopuses and cuttlefish, who change color by moving around the pigment in their cells, chameleons have specialized cells called iridophores that do the job for them. A 2015 study published in Nature Communications looked at how five adult male, four adult female, and four juvenile panther chameleons changed their colors. They found that chameleons have two layers of these iridescent cells\u2014iridophores. These iridophores have pigments and nanocrystals within them that reflect light of different wavelengths. The chameleon changes its color by exciting or relaxing its skin, changing the density of the upper layer of iridophores. A chameleon\u2019s skin has a few different cell types that contribute to its color. The uppermost layer is composed of cells that contain a yellow pigment\u2014xanthophores\u2014and those that have red pigment\u2014erythrophores\u2014which are mainly present in striped regions. Under this layer lies the iridophores, which reflect different wavelengths of light depending on how they are packed and ordered. Finally, the last layer is composed of melanophores. These melanophores have extensions that reach the uppermost layer of the skin. When a chameleon is in a relaxed state, the nanocrystals in the skin are closer to each other and they reflect shorter wavelengths, like blue. When a chameleon is excited, the distance between nanocrystals increases and they reflect longer wavelengths, such as red, orange and yellow. These colors are seen most vividly in striped bands across the chameleon\u2019s body. A chameleon\u2019s green color is the result of yellow and blue wavelengths. The yellow from the xanthophores, plus the blue light reflected from the iridophores, results in the color green. In the relaxed, neutral state, the green is light and vibrant. When in a suppressed mood, such as when it needs to hide, the chameleon turns to darker shades, sometimes turning a dark brown. This is due to the melanophores dispersing pigment to the upper layers through their extension. Also Read: Can An Octopus Change The Way It Looks? Chameleons don\u2019t change their color for camouflage, as most people think. They can\u2019t perfectly match your crazy pink curtains or blend into your blue couch. As much as Pascal from Disney\u2019s Tangled might change his colors on whim, alas, that is fiction for real chameleons, although their skin color does serve some camouflaging purposes. Chameleons spend most of their time in trees, high up amidst the brown branches and green leaves. Their own green and brown hues do allow them to blend into the leafy background, but their ability to change color isn\u2019t intended for that. Chameleons, as recent research has found, change color for two main reasons\u2014to communicate and to control their temperature. Animals have evolved different ways to communicate with one another. Humans primarily use language, fireflies use light, and chameleons use color. The chameleon\u2019s color change can indicate its mood. An angry chameleon will have a darker color, whereas a chameleon in a relaxed mood will have a lighter color. A 2013 study looked at the coloration in male chameleons during competition with other males. The researchers reported that different coloration patterns in different body regions sent different signals to their competitors. Males with a darker head were more likely to win fights, while those with brighter stripes were more likely to approach their opponent first during the competition. This is mainly something that male chameleons do. Males might change their color to attract a mate. A male chameleon will switch to lighter hues to show the female how healthy and sexy he is, or he might darken his color if he sees another male. A chameleon, upon seeing a rival, changes its color to darker shades in order to assert dominance. Female chameleons also have color-changing abilities, but they are limited. They\u2019re rather dull-colored in comparison to their male counterparts. The other reason some chameleons change their colors is the temperature. A cold chameleon will turn dark to absorb more\n\nquestion: What do longer wavelengths, such as red, orange, and yellow, indicate when reflected by chameleons?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Excitement or being in a suppressed mood.", "usage": 1096}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

For example, the panther chameleon is found in open, dry environments like those of Yemen. The iridophores present in these chameleons help decrease the absorption of sunlight, which is crucial for survival. A study published in 1993 found that a dark coloration was frequently present in the morning time. The researchers concluded that this could serve to reduce basking time for chameleons. Color change in chameleons and other animals still isn\u2019t fully understood. The range of occasions for which chameleons adapt their colors is still being outlined. The more exciting question seems to be how such color-changing evolved in the first place. From complex nanocrystal lattices to pigment dispersal in the blink of an eye, the intricate ways that animals change color is stunning, fascinating and downright magical!

As BBC News\u2019 Jonathan Webb reports, reptiles are known to shift hues by two means. Warm and dark colors come from adjusting the dispersal of dark or light pigment in cells within skin layers; blues and whites, on the other hand, deemed \u201cstructural colors,\u201d emerge \u201cfrom light bouncing off physical elements\u201d in their skin. Chameleons can adjust some skin pigments to appear lighter or darker. But until recently, scientists assumed the same sort of process was happening when the animals radically adjust their appearance into bright colors, like reds and yellows. Not so, argues the study, out this week in the journal Nature Communications. In observing and dissecting panther chameleons, the team of Swiss scientists found that the animals have \u201ctwo superposed thick layers of iridophore cells\u2014iridescent cells that have pigment and reflect light,\u201d reports NBC News. Within these iridophore cells are a variety of nanocrystals that work together, according to the study\u2019s lead author, Michel Milinkovitch, \u201cas a selective mirror\u201d. A chameleon can adjust the wavelengths of light reflected in these tiny crystals by either tightening or relaxing their skin, which changes the spacing of the cells. \u201cLight will go through except for very specific wavelengths,\u201d Milinkovitch told BBC. \u201cIf the distance between the layers is small, it reflects small wavelengths, like blue; if the distance is large it reflects larger wavelengths - for example, red.\u201d The team watched this process in both live animals and in samples of chameleon skin. When they tensed the skin by drying it up, they saw the same drastic change in color apparent in live panther chameleons confronting, for example, a male competitor. The study also found that beneath the lattice of crystals was a deeper skin layer that reflects near-infrared light, which likely helps the lizard to stay cool in the heat of the sun. As Webb points out, the combination of color changing crystals and a reflective skin layer appears to be unique to chameleons; other lizards just have one or the other. And here\u2019s a little bit of chameleon trivia: the animals\u2019 radical color changes (which can take minutes to fully unfold) aren\u2019t performed to blend in with their surroundings as children\u2019s books might have us believe; rather, they change outfits to communicate to other lizards and to react to temperature or mood. And not all chameleons can go Technicolor\u2014some can only range from green, brown and gray. But panther chameleons, found in Madagascar and the focus of this study, can exhibit exotic blues, yellows, greens and reds. And now we can thank crystals for the show.

Wonder of the Day #651 SCIENCE \u2014 Life Science Today\u2019s Wonder of the Day was inspired by Lorilynn. Lorilynn Wonders, \u201cWhy do chameleons change colors\u201d Thanks for WONDERing with us, Lorilynn! Did you ever just wish you could blend into the background? Perhaps you forgot to read all of your homework assignment and the teacher calls on you. Wouldn't it be great if you could make yourself look like a desk and chair? If you're a fan of lizards, you probably already know that there are some types of lizards \u2014 called chameleons \u2014 that can change their color. Have you ever wondered why \u2014 and how \u2014 they can do this? Chameleons are lizards that are part of the scientific family called Chamaeleonidae. In addition to the ability to change color, chameleons have many other characteristics that make them special, including parrot-like feet, eyes that can look in two different directions at once and long tongues and tails. Chameleons come in many colors, such as pink, blue, orange, red, yellow, green and turquoise. They can be found in Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. There are about 160 different species of chameleons, and they can live in both rain forests and deserts. Many people believe chameleons change colors to disguise themselves and hide from predators. However, chameleons are very fast \u2014 many can run up to 21 miles per hour \u2014 and can avoid most predators quite easily. Camouflage is thus only a secondary reason why most chameleons change color. So why would they want to change colors? Scientists believe that chameleons change color to reflect their moods. By doing so, they send social signals to other chameleons. For example, darker colors tend to mean a chameleon is angry. Lighter colors might be used to attract mates. Some chameleons also change colors to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature or light. For example, a chameleon that gets cold might change to a darker color to absorb more heat and warm its body. For many years, scientists believed that chameleons change their color by manipulating specialized cells \u2014 called chromatophores \u2014 that contain different colors of pigment. For example, when a chameleon wants to convey a particular mood or message, its brain sends a message to its chromatophores, which then move pigments around to change the chameleon's color. Today, researchers believe that pigments aren't the only mechanism chameleons use to change their colors. While pigments can account for warmer tones, such as greens, they can't explain brighter tones, such as reds and yellows. Recent studies have shown that chameleons also have a special layer of cells \u2014 called iridophores \u2014 under their skin. These special cells, which contain pigment and reflect light, are made up of hundreds of thousands of guanine crystals. Chameleons can relax or excite their skin, causing these special cells to move and change structure. Researchers found that, when this happens, these cells act like prisms, reflecting different wavelengths of light to create the variety of tones we see.

They change color by changing the arrangement of certain skin cells called iridophores. These cells have nanocrystals that reflect light of different wavelengths, depending on their physical orientation. The color-changing ability of chameleons has always intrigued human beings. We often think about how cool and easy life would be if we could change our colors, blend in with our surroundings, and camouflage ourselves just like a chameleon can. It would definitely help us escape from awkward situations more easily! Recommended Video for you:Chameleon Chromatics: How They Change Color and Why Recommended Video for you: Unlike octopuses and cuttlefish, who change color by moving around the pigment in their cells, chameleons have specialized cells called iridophores that do the job for them. A 2015 study published in Nature Communications looked at how five adult male, four adult female, and four juvenile panther chameleons changed their colors. They found that chameleons have two layers of these iridescent cells\u2014iridophores. These iridophores have pigments and nanocrystals within them that reflect light of different wavelengths. The chameleon changes its color by exciting or relaxing its skin, changing the density of the upper layer of iridophores. A chameleon\u2019s skin has a few different cell types that contribute to its color. The uppermost layer is composed of cells that contain a yellow pigment\u2014xanthophores\u2014and those that have red pigment\u2014erythrophores\u2014which are mainly present in striped regions. Under this layer lies the iridophores, which reflect different wavelengths of light depending on how they are packed and ordered. Finally, the last layer is composed of melanophores. These melanophores have extensions that reach the uppermost layer of the skin. When a chameleon is in a relaxed state, the nanocrystals in the skin are closer to each other and they reflect shorter wavelengths, like blue. When a chameleon is excited, the distance between nanocrystals increases and they reflect longer wavelengths, such as red, orange and yellow. These colors are seen most vividly in striped bands across the chameleon\u2019s body. A chameleon\u2019s green color is the result of yellow and blue wavelengths. The yellow from the xanthophores, plus the blue light reflected from the iridophores, results in the color green. In the relaxed, neutral state, the green is light and vibrant. When in a suppressed mood, such as when it needs to hide, the chameleon turns to darker shades, sometimes turning a dark brown. This is due to the melanophores dispersing pigment to the upper layers through their extension. Also Read: Can An Octopus Change The Way It Looks? Chameleons don\u2019t change their color for camouflage, as most people think. They can\u2019t perfectly match your crazy pink curtains or blend into your blue couch. As much as Pascal from Disney\u2019s Tangled might change his colors on whim, alas, that is fiction for real chameleons, although their skin color does serve some camouflaging purposes. Chameleons spend most of their time in trees, high up amidst the brown branches and green leaves. Their own green and brown hues do allow them to blend into the leafy background, but their ability to change color isn\u2019t intended for that. Chameleons, as recent research has found, change color for two main reasons\u2014to communicate and to control their temperature. Animals have evolved different ways to communicate with one another. Humans primarily use language, fireflies use light, and chameleons use color. The chameleon\u2019s color change can indicate its mood. An angry chameleon will have a darker color, whereas a chameleon in a relaxed mood will have a lighter color. A 2013 study looked at the coloration in male chameleons during competition with other males. The researchers reported that different coloration patterns in different body regions sent different signals to their competitors. Males with a darker head were more likely to win fights, while those with brighter stripes were more likely to approach their opponent first during the competition. This is mainly something that male chameleons do. Males might change their color to attract a mate. A male chameleon will switch to lighter hues to show the female how healthy and sexy he is, or he might darken his color if he sees another male. A chameleon, upon seeing a rival, changes its color to darker shades in order to assert dominance. Female chameleons also have color-changing abilities, but they are limited. They\u2019re rather dull-colored in comparison to their male counterparts. The other reason some chameleons change their colors is the temperature. A cold chameleon will turn dark to absorb more\n\nquestion: What is the purpose of chameleons changing colors?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "To communicate and to control their temperature.", "usage": 1083}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

For example, the panther chameleon is found in open, dry environments like those of Yemen. The iridophores present in these chameleons help decrease the absorption of sunlight, which is crucial for survival. A study published in 1993 found that a dark coloration was frequently present in the morning time. The researchers concluded that this could serve to reduce basking time for chameleons. Color change in chameleons and other animals still isn\u2019t fully understood. The range of occasions for which chameleons adapt their colors is still being outlined. The more exciting question seems to be how such color-changing evolved in the first place. From complex nanocrystal lattices to pigment dispersal in the blink of an eye, the intricate ways that animals change color is stunning, fascinating and downright magical!

As BBC News\u2019 Jonathan Webb reports, reptiles are known to shift hues by two means. Warm and dark colors come from adjusting the dispersal of dark or light pigment in cells within skin layers; blues and whites, on the other hand, deemed \u201cstructural colors,\u201d emerge \u201cfrom light bouncing off physical elements\u201d in their skin. Chameleons can adjust some skin pigments to appear lighter or darker. But until recently, scientists assumed the same sort of process was happening when the animals radically adjust their appearance into bright colors, like reds and yellows. Not so, argues the study, out this week in the journal Nature Communications. In observing and dissecting panther chameleons, the team of Swiss scientists found that the animals have \u201ctwo superposed thick layers of iridophore cells\u2014iridescent cells that have pigment and reflect light,\u201d reports NBC News. Within these iridophore cells are a variety of nanocrystals that work together, according to the study\u2019s lead author, Michel Milinkovitch, \u201cas a selective mirror\u201d. A chameleon can adjust the wavelengths of light reflected in these tiny crystals by either tightening or relaxing their skin, which changes the spacing of the cells. \u201cLight will go through except for very specific wavelengths,\u201d Milinkovitch told BBC. \u201cIf the distance between the layers is small, it reflects small wavelengths, like blue; if the distance is large it reflects larger wavelengths - for example, red.\u201d The team watched this process in both live animals and in samples of chameleon skin. When they tensed the skin by drying it up, they saw the same drastic change in color apparent in live panther chameleons confronting, for example, a male competitor. The study also found that beneath the lattice of crystals was a deeper skin layer that reflects near-infrared light, which likely helps the lizard to stay cool in the heat of the sun. As Webb points out, the combination of color changing crystals and a reflective skin layer appears to be unique to chameleons; other lizards just have one or the other. And here\u2019s a little bit of chameleon trivia: the animals\u2019 radical color changes (which can take minutes to fully unfold) aren\u2019t performed to blend in with their surroundings as children\u2019s books might have us believe; rather, they change outfits to communicate to other lizards and to react to temperature or mood. And not all chameleons can go Technicolor\u2014some can only range from green, brown and gray. But panther chameleons, found in Madagascar and the focus of this study, can exhibit exotic blues, yellows, greens and reds. And now we can thank crystals for the show.

Chameleons come in many colors, such as pink, blue, orange, red, yellow, green and turquoise. They can be found in Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. There are about 160 different species of chameleons, and they can live in both rain forests and deserts. Many people believe chameleons change colors to disguise themselves and hide from predators. However, chameleons are very fast \u2014 many can run up to 21 miles per hour \u2014 and can avoid most predators quite easily. Camouflage is thus only a secondary reason why most chameleons change color. So why would they want to change colors? Scientists believe that chameleons change color to reflect their moods. By doing so, they send social signals to other chameleons. For example, darker colors tend to mean a chameleon is angry. Lighter colors might be used to attract mates. Some chameleons also change colors to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature or light. For example, a chameleon that gets cold might change to a darker color to absorb more heat and warm its body. For many years, scientists believed that chameleons change their color by manipulating specialized cells \u2014 called chromatophores \u2014 that contain different colors of pigment. For example, when a chameleon wants to convey a particular mood or message, its brain sends a message to its chromatophores, which then move pigments around to change the chameleon's color. Today, researchers believe that pigments aren't the only mechanism chameleons use to change their colors. While pigments can account for warmer tones, such as greens, they can't explain brighter tones, such as reds and yellows. Recent studies have shown that chameleons also have a special layer of cells \u2014 called iridophores \u2014 under their skin. These special cells, which contain pigment and reflect light, are made up of hundreds of thousands of guanine crystals. Chameleons can relax or excite their skin, causing these special cells to move and change structure. Researchers found that, when this happens, these cells act like prisms, reflecting different wavelengths of light to create the variety of tones we see.

They change color by changing the arrangement of certain skin cells called iridophores. These cells have nanocrystals that reflect light of different wavelengths, depending on their physical orientation. The color-changing ability of chameleons has always intrigued human beings. We often think about how cool and easy life would be if we could change our colors, blend in with our surroundings, and camouflage ourselves just like a chameleon can. It would definitely help us escape from awkward situations more easily! Recommended Video for you:Chameleon Chromatics: How They Change Color and Why Recommended Video for you: Unlike octopuses and cuttlefish, who change color by moving around the pigment in their cells, chameleons have specialized cells called iridophores that do the job for them. A 2015 study published in Nature Communications looked at how five adult male, four adult female, and four juvenile panther chameleons changed their colors. They found that chameleons have two layers of these iridescent cells\u2014iridophores. These iridophores have pigments and nanocrystals within them that reflect light of different wavelengths. The chameleon changes its color by exciting or relaxing its skin, changing the density of the upper layer of iridophores. A chameleon\u2019s skin has a few different cell types that contribute to its color. The uppermost layer is composed of cells that contain a yellow pigment\u2014xanthophores\u2014and those that have red pigment\u2014erythrophores\u2014which are mainly present in striped regions. Under this layer lies the iridophores, which reflect different wavelengths of light depending on how they are packed and ordered. Finally, the last layer is composed of melanophores. These melanophores have extensions that reach the uppermost layer of the skin. When a chameleon is in a relaxed state, the nanocrystals in the skin are closer to each other and they reflect shorter wavelengths, like blue. When a chameleon is excited, the distance between nanocrystals increases and they reflect longer wavelengths, such as red, orange and yellow. These colors are seen most vividly in striped bands across the chameleon\u2019s body. A chameleon\u2019s green color is the result of yellow and blue wavelengths. The yellow from the xanthophores, plus the blue light reflected from the iridophores, results in the color green. In the relaxed, neutral state, the green is light and vibrant. When in a suppressed mood, such as when it needs to hide, the chameleon turns to darker shades, sometimes turning a dark brown. This is due to the melanophores dispersing pigment to the upper layers through their extension. Also Read: Can An Octopus Change The Way It Looks? Chameleons don\u2019t change their color for camouflage, as most people think. They can\u2019t perfectly match your crazy pink curtains or blend into your blue couch. As much as Pascal from Disney\u2019s Tangled might change his colors on whim, alas, that is fiction for real chameleons, although their skin color does serve some camouflaging purposes. Chameleons spend most of their time in trees, high up amidst the brown branches and green leaves. Their own green and brown hues do allow them to blend into the leafy background, but their ability to change color isn\u2019t intended for that. Chameleons, as recent research has found, change color for two main reasons\u2014to communicate and to control their temperature. Animals have evolved different ways to communicate with one another. Humans primarily use language, fireflies use light, and chameleons use color. The chameleon\u2019s color change can indicate its mood. An angry chameleon will have a darker color, whereas a chameleon in a relaxed mood will have a lighter color. A 2013 study looked at the coloration in male chameleons during competition with other males. The researchers reported that different coloration patterns in different body regions sent different signals to their competitors. Males with a darker head were more likely to win fights, while those with brighter stripes were more likely to approach their opponent first during the competition. This is mainly something that male chameleons do. Males might change their color to attract a mate. A male chameleon will switch to lighter hues to show the female how healthy and sexy he is, or he might darken his color if he sees another male. A chameleon, upon seeing a rival, changes its color to darker shades in order to assert dominance. Female chameleons also have color-changing abilities, but they are limited. They\u2019re rather dull-colored in comparison to their male counterparts. The other reason some chameleons change their colors is the temperature. A cold chameleon will turn dark to absorb more\n\nquestion: How do chameleons use their colors for communication?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Chameleons use their colors for communication by changing their color to indicate their mood, attract mates, assert dominance, and signal aggression.", "usage": 1103}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

For example, the panther chameleon is found in open, dry environments like those of Yemen. The iridophores present in these chameleons help decrease the absorption of sunlight, which is crucial for survival. A study published in 1993 found that a dark coloration was frequently present in the morning time. The researchers concluded that this could serve to reduce basking time for chameleons. Color change in chameleons and other animals still isn\u2019t fully understood. The range of occasions for which chameleons adapt their colors is still being outlined. The more exciting question seems to be how such color-changing evolved in the first place. From complex nanocrystal lattices to pigment dispersal in the blink of an eye, the intricate ways that animals change color is stunning, fascinating and downright magical!

As BBC News\u2019 Jonathan Webb reports, reptiles are known to shift hues by two means. Warm and dark colors come from adjusting the dispersal of dark or light pigment in cells within skin layers; blues and whites, on the other hand, deemed \u201cstructural colors,\u201d emerge \u201cfrom light bouncing off physical elements\u201d in their skin. Chameleons can adjust some skin pigments to appear lighter or darker. But until recently, scientists assumed the same sort of process was happening when the animals radically adjust their appearance into bright colors, like reds and yellows. Not so, argues the study, out this week in the journal Nature Communications. In observing and dissecting panther chameleons, the team of Swiss scientists found that the animals have \u201ctwo superposed thick layers of iridophore cells\u2014iridescent cells that have pigment and reflect light,\u201d reports NBC News. Within these iridophore cells are a variety of nanocrystals that work together, according to the study\u2019s lead author, Michel Milinkovitch, \u201cas a selective mirror\u201d. A chameleon can adjust the wavelengths of light reflected in these tiny crystals by either tightening or relaxing their skin, which changes the spacing of the cells. \u201cLight will go through except for very specific wavelengths,\u201d Milinkovitch told BBC. \u201cIf the distance between the layers is small, it reflects small wavelengths, like blue; if the distance is large it reflects larger wavelengths - for example, red.\u201d The team watched this process in both live animals and in samples of chameleon skin. When they tensed the skin by drying it up, they saw the same drastic change in color apparent in live panther chameleons confronting, for example, a male competitor. The study also found that beneath the lattice of crystals was a deeper skin layer that reflects near-infrared light, which likely helps the lizard to stay cool in the heat of the sun. As Webb points out, the combination of color changing crystals and a reflective skin layer appears to be unique to chameleons; other lizards just have one or the other. And here\u2019s a little bit of chameleon trivia: the animals\u2019 radical color changes (which can take minutes to fully unfold) aren\u2019t performed to blend in with their surroundings as children\u2019s books might have us believe; rather, they change outfits to communicate to other lizards and to react to temperature or mood. And not all chameleons can go Technicolor\u2014some can only range from green, brown and gray. But panther chameleons, found in Madagascar and the focus of this study, can exhibit exotic blues, yellows, greens and reds. And now we can thank crystals for the show.

Wonder of the Day #651 SCIENCE \u2014 Life Science Today\u2019s Wonder of the Day was inspired by Lorilynn. Lorilynn Wonders, \u201cWhy do chameleons change colors\u201d Thanks for WONDERing with us, Lorilynn! Did you ever just wish you could blend into the background? Perhaps you forgot to read all of your homework assignment and the teacher calls on you. Wouldn't it be great if you could make yourself look like a desk and chair? If you're a fan of lizards, you probably already know that there are some types of lizards \u2014 called chameleons \u2014 that can change their color. Have you ever wondered why \u2014 and how \u2014 they can do this? Chameleons are lizards that are part of the scientific family called Chamaeleonidae. In addition to the ability to change color, chameleons have many other characteristics that make them special, including parrot-like feet, eyes that can look in two different directions at once and long tongues and tails. Chameleons come in many colors, such as pink, blue, orange, red, yellow, green and turquoise. They can be found in Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. There are about 160 different species of chameleons, and they can live in both rain forests and deserts. Many people believe chameleons change colors to disguise themselves and hide from predators. However, chameleons are very fast \u2014 many can run up to 21 miles per hour \u2014 and can avoid most predators quite easily. Camouflage is thus only a secondary reason why most chameleons change color. So why would they want to change colors? Scientists believe that chameleons change color to reflect their moods. By doing so, they send social signals to other chameleons. For example, darker colors tend to mean a chameleon is angry. Lighter colors might be used to attract mates. Some chameleons also change colors to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature or light. For example, a chameleon that gets cold might change to a darker color to absorb more heat and warm its body. For many years, scientists believed that chameleons change their color by manipulating specialized cells \u2014 called chromatophores \u2014 that contain different colors of pigment. For example, when a chameleon wants to convey a particular mood or message, its brain sends a message to its chromatophores, which then move pigments around to change the chameleon's color. Today, researchers believe that pigments aren't the only mechanism chameleons use to change their colors. While pigments can account for warmer tones, such as greens, they can't explain brighter tones, such as reds and yellows. Recent studies have shown that chameleons also have a special layer of cells \u2014 called iridophores \u2014 under their skin. These special cells, which contain pigment and reflect light, are made up of hundreds of thousands of guanine crystals. Chameleons can relax or excite their skin, causing these special cells to move and change structure. Researchers found that, when this happens, these cells act like prisms, reflecting different wavelengths of light to create the variety of tones we see.

They change color by changing the arrangement of certain skin cells called iridophores. These cells have nanocrystals that reflect light of different wavelengths, depending on their physical orientation. The color-changing ability of chameleons has always intrigued human beings. We often think about how cool and easy life would be if we could change our colors, blend in with our surroundings, and camouflage ourselves just like a chameleon can. It would definitely help us escape from awkward situations more easily! Recommended Video for you:Chameleon Chromatics: How They Change Color and Why Recommended Video for you: Unlike octopuses and cuttlefish, who change color by moving around the pigment in their cells, chameleons have specialized cells called iridophores that do the job for them. A 2015 study published in Nature Communications looked at how five adult male, four adult female, and four juvenile panther chameleons changed their colors. They found that chameleons have two layers of these iridescent cells\u2014iridophores. These iridophores have pigments and nanocrystals within them that reflect light of different wavelengths. The chameleon changes its color by exciting or relaxing its skin, changing the density of the upper layer of iridophores. A chameleon\u2019s skin has a few different cell types that contribute to its color. The uppermost layer is composed of cells that contain a yellow pigment\u2014xanthophores\u2014and those that have red pigment\u2014erythrophores\u2014which are mainly present in striped regions. Under this layer lies the iridophores, which reflect different wavelengths of light depending on how they are packed and ordered. Finally, the last layer is composed of melanophores. These melanophores have extensions that reach the uppermost layer of the skin. When a chameleon is in a relaxed state, the nanocrystals in the skin are closer to each other and they reflect shorter wavelengths, like blue. When a chameleon is excited, the distance between nanocrystals increases and they reflect longer wavelengths, such as red, orange and yellow. These colors are seen most vividly in striped bands across the chameleon\u2019s body. A chameleon\u2019s green color is the result of yellow and blue wavelengths. The yellow from the xanthophores, plus the blue light reflected from the iridophores, results in the color green. In the relaxed, neutral state, the green is light and vibrant. When in a suppressed mood, such as when it needs to hide, the chameleon turns to darker shades, sometimes turning a dark brown. This is due to the melanophores dispersing pigment to the upper layers through their extension. Also Read: Can An Octopus Change The Way It Looks? Chameleons don\u2019t change their color for camouflage, as most people think. They can\u2019t perfectly match your crazy pink curtains or blend into your blue couch. As much as Pascal from Disney\u2019s Tangled might change his colors on whim, alas, that is fiction for real chameleons, although their skin color does serve some camouflaging purposes. Chameleons spend most of their time in trees, high up amidst the brown branches and green leaves. Their own green and brown hues do allow them to blend into the leafy background, but their ability to change color isn\u2019t intended for that. Chameleons, as recent research has found, change color for two main reasons\u2014to communicate and to control their temperature. Animals have evolved different ways to communicate with one another. Humans primarily use language, fireflies use light, and chameleons use color. The chameleon\u2019s color change can indicate its mood. An angry chameleon will have a darker color, whereas a chameleon in a relaxed mood will have a lighter color. A 2013 study looked at the coloration in male chameleons during competition with other males. The researchers reported that different coloration patterns in different body regions sent different signals to their competitors. Males with a darker head were more likely to win fights, while those with brighter stripes were more likely to approach their opponent first during the competition. This is mainly something that male chameleons do. Males might change their color to attract a mate. A male chameleon will switch to lighter hues to show the female how healthy and sexy he is, or he might darken his color if he sees another male. A chameleon, upon seeing a rival, changes its color to darker shades in order to assert dominance. Female chameleons also have color-changing abilities, but they are limited. They\u2019re rather dull-colored in comparison to their male counterparts. The other reason some chameleons change their colors is the temperature. A cold chameleon will turn dark to absorb more\n\nquestion: What do darker colors on chameleons indicate?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "An angry or dominant mood.", "usage": 1080}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

For example, the panther chameleon is found in open, dry environments like those of Yemen. The iridophores present in these chameleons help decrease the absorption of sunlight, which is crucial for survival. A study published in 1993 found that a dark coloration was frequently present in the morning time. The researchers concluded that this could serve to reduce basking time for chameleons. Color change in chameleons and other animals still isn\u2019t fully understood. The range of occasions for which chameleons adapt their colors is still being outlined. The more exciting question seems to be how such color-changing evolved in the first place. From complex nanocrystal lattices to pigment dispersal in the blink of an eye, the intricate ways that animals change color is stunning, fascinating and downright magical!

As BBC News\u2019 Jonathan Webb reports, reptiles are known to shift hues by two means. Warm and dark colors come from adjusting the dispersal of dark or light pigment in cells within skin layers; blues and whites, on the other hand, deemed \u201cstructural colors,\u201d emerge \u201cfrom light bouncing off physical elements\u201d in their skin. Chameleons can adjust some skin pigments to appear lighter or darker. But until recently, scientists assumed the same sort of process was happening when the animals radically adjust their appearance into bright colors, like reds and yellows. Not so, argues the study, out this week in the journal Nature Communications. In observing and dissecting panther chameleons, the team of Swiss scientists found that the animals have \u201ctwo superposed thick layers of iridophore cells\u2014iridescent cells that have pigment and reflect light,\u201d reports NBC News. Within these iridophore cells are a variety of nanocrystals that work together, according to the study\u2019s lead author, Michel Milinkovitch, \u201cas a selective mirror\u201d. A chameleon can adjust the wavelengths of light reflected in these tiny crystals by either tightening or relaxing their skin, which changes the spacing of the cells. \u201cLight will go through except for very specific wavelengths,\u201d Milinkovitch told BBC. \u201cIf the distance between the layers is small, it reflects small wavelengths, like blue; if the distance is large it reflects larger wavelengths - for example, red.\u201d The team watched this process in both live animals and in samples of chameleon skin. When they tensed the skin by drying it up, they saw the same drastic change in color apparent in live panther chameleons confronting, for example, a male competitor. The study also found that beneath the lattice of crystals was a deeper skin layer that reflects near-infrared light, which likely helps the lizard to stay cool in the heat of the sun. As Webb points out, the combination of color changing crystals and a reflective skin layer appears to be unique to chameleons; other lizards just have one or the other. And here\u2019s a little bit of chameleon trivia: the animals\u2019 radical color changes (which can take minutes to fully unfold) aren\u2019t performed to blend in with their surroundings as children\u2019s books might have us believe; rather, they change outfits to communicate to other lizards and to react to temperature or mood. And not all chameleons can go Technicolor\u2014some can only range from green, brown and gray. But panther chameleons, found in Madagascar and the focus of this study, can exhibit exotic blues, yellows, greens and reds. And now we can thank crystals for the show.

Wonder of the Day #651 SCIENCE \u2014 Life Science Today\u2019s Wonder of the Day was inspired by Lorilynn. Lorilynn Wonders, \u201cWhy do chameleons change colors\u201d Thanks for WONDERing with us, Lorilynn! Did you ever just wish you could blend into the background? Perhaps you forgot to read all of your homework assignment and the teacher calls on you. Wouldn't it be great if you could make yourself look like a desk and chair? If you're a fan of lizards, you probably already know that there are some types of lizards \u2014 called chameleons \u2014 that can change their color. Have you ever wondered why \u2014 and how \u2014 they can do this? Chameleons are lizards that are part of the scientific family called Chamaeleonidae. In addition to the ability to change color, chameleons have many other characteristics that make them special, including parrot-like feet, eyes that can look in two different directions at once and long tongues and tails. Chameleons come in many colors, such as pink, blue, orange, red, yellow, green and turquoise. They can be found in Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. There are about 160 different species of chameleons, and they can live in both rain forests and deserts. Many people believe chameleons change colors to disguise themselves and hide from predators. However, chameleons are very fast \u2014 many can run up to 21 miles per hour \u2014 and can avoid most predators quite easily. Camouflage is thus only a secondary reason why most chameleons change color. So why would they want to change colors? Scientists believe that chameleons change color to reflect their moods. By doing so, they send social signals to other chameleons. For example, darker colors tend to mean a chameleon is angry. Lighter colors might be used to attract mates. Some chameleons also change colors to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature or light. For example, a chameleon that gets cold might change to a darker color to absorb more heat and warm its body. For many years, scientists believed that chameleons change their color by manipulating specialized cells \u2014 called chromatophores \u2014 that contain different colors of pigment. For example, when a chameleon wants to convey a particular mood or message, its brain sends a message to its chromatophores, which then move pigments around to change the chameleon's color. Today, researchers believe that pigments aren't the only mechanism chameleons use to change their colors. While pigments can account for warmer tones, such as greens, they can't explain brighter tones, such as reds and yellows. Recent studies have shown that chameleons also have a special layer of cells \u2014 called iridophores \u2014 under their skin. These special cells, which contain pigment and reflect light, are made up of hundreds of thousands of guanine crystals. Chameleons can relax or excite their skin, causing these special cells to move and change structure. Researchers found that, when this happens, these cells act like prisms, reflecting different wavelengths of light to create the variety of tones we see.

They change color by changing the arrangement of certain skin cells called iridophores. These cells have nanocrystals that reflect light of different wavelengths, depending on their physical orientation. The color-changing ability of chameleons has always intrigued human beings. We often think about how cool and easy life would be if we could change our colors, blend in with our surroundings, and camouflage ourselves just like a chameleon can. It would definitely help us escape from awkward situations more easily! Recommended Video for you:Chameleon Chromatics: How They Change Color and Why Recommended Video for you: Unlike octopuses and cuttlefish, who change color by moving around the pigment in their cells, chameleons have specialized cells called iridophores that do the job for them. A 2015 study published in Nature Communications looked at how five adult male, four adult female, and four juvenile panther chameleons changed their colors. They found that chameleons have two layers of these iridescent cells\u2014iridophores. These iridophores have pigments and nanocrystals within them that reflect light of different wavelengths. The chameleon changes its color by exciting or relaxing its skin, changing the density of the upper layer of iridophores. A chameleon\u2019s skin has a few different cell types that contribute to its color. The uppermost layer is composed of cells that contain a yellow pigment\u2014xanthophores\u2014and those that have red pigment\u2014erythrophores\u2014which are mainly present in striped regions. Under this layer lies the iridophores, which reflect different wavelengths of light depending on how they are packed and ordered. Finally, the last layer is composed of melanophores. These melanophores have extensions that reach the uppermost layer of the skin. When a chameleon is in a relaxed state, the nanocrystals in the skin are closer to each other and they reflect shorter wavelengths, like blue. When a chameleon is excited, the distance between nanocrystals increases and they reflect longer wavelengths, such as red, orange and yellow. These colors are seen most vividly in striped bands across the chameleon\u2019s body. A chameleon\u2019s green color is the result of yellow and blue wavelengths. The yellow from the xanthophores, plus the blue light reflected from the iridophores, results in the color green. In the relaxed, neutral state, the green is light and vibrant. When in a suppressed mood, such as when it needs to hide, the chameleon turns to darker shades, sometimes turning a dark brown. This is due to the melanophores dispersing pigment to the upper layers through their extension. Also Read: Can An Octopus Change The Way It Looks? Chameleons don\u2019t change their color for camouflage, as most people think. They can\u2019t perfectly match your crazy pink curtains or blend into your blue couch. As much as Pascal from Disney\u2019s Tangled might change his colors on whim, alas, that is fiction for real chameleons, although their skin color does serve some camouflaging purposes. Chameleons spend most of their time in trees, high up amidst the brown branches and green leaves. Their own green and brown hues do allow them to blend into the leafy background, but their ability to change color isn\u2019t intended for that. Chameleons, as recent research has found, change color for two main reasons\u2014to communicate and to control their temperature. Animals have evolved different ways to communicate with one another. Humans primarily use language, fireflies use light, and chameleons use color. The chameleon\u2019s color change can indicate its mood. An angry chameleon will have a darker color, whereas a chameleon in a relaxed mood will have a lighter color. A 2013 study looked at the coloration in male chameleons during competition with other males. The researchers reported that different coloration patterns in different body regions sent different signals to their competitors. Males with a darker head were more likely to win fights, while those with brighter stripes were more likely to approach their opponent first during the competition. This is mainly something that male chameleons do. Males might change their color to attract a mate. A male chameleon will switch to lighter hues to show the female how healthy and sexy he is, or he might darken his color if he sees another male. A chameleon, upon seeing a rival, changes its color to darker shades in order to assert dominance. Female chameleons also have color-changing abilities, but they are limited. They\u2019re rather dull-colored in comparison to their male counterparts. The other reason some chameleons change their colors is the temperature. A cold chameleon will turn dark to absorb more\n\nquestion: How do chameleons change their color?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "A chameleon changes its color by exciting or relaxing its skin, changing the density of the upper layer of iridophores.", "usage": 1099}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

For example, the panther chameleon is found in open, dry environments like those of Yemen. The iridophores present in these chameleons help decrease the absorption of sunlight, which is crucial for survival. A study published in 1993 found that a dark coloration was frequently present in the morning time. The researchers concluded that this could serve to reduce basking time for chameleons. Color change in chameleons and other animals still isn\u2019t fully understood. The range of occasions for which chameleons adapt their colors is still being outlined. The more exciting question seems to be how such color-changing evolved in the first place. From complex nanocrystal lattices to pigment dispersal in the blink of an eye, the intricate ways that animals change color is stunning, fascinating and downright magical!

As BBC News\u2019 Jonathan Webb reports, reptiles are known to shift hues by two means. Warm and dark colors come from adjusting the dispersal of dark or light pigment in cells within skin layers; blues and whites, on the other hand, deemed \u201cstructural colors,\u201d emerge \u201cfrom light bouncing off physical elements\u201d in their skin. Chameleons can adjust some skin pigments to appear lighter or darker. But until recently, scientists assumed the same sort of process was happening when the animals radically adjust their appearance into bright colors, like reds and yellows. Not so, argues the study, out this week in the journal Nature Communications. In observing and dissecting panther chameleons, the team of Swiss scientists found that the animals have \u201ctwo superposed thick layers of iridophore cells\u2014iridescent cells that have pigment and reflect light,\u201d reports NBC News. Within these iridophore cells are a variety of nanocrystals that work together, according to the study\u2019s lead author, Michel Milinkovitch, \u201cas a selective mirror\u201d. A chameleon can adjust the wavelengths of light reflected in these tiny crystals by either tightening or relaxing their skin, which changes the spacing of the cells. \u201cLight will go through except for very specific wavelengths,\u201d Milinkovitch told BBC. \u201cIf the distance between the layers is small, it reflects small wavelengths, like blue; if the distance is large it reflects larger wavelengths - for example, red.\u201d The team watched this process in both live animals and in samples of chameleon skin. When they tensed the skin by drying it up, they saw the same drastic change in color apparent in live panther chameleons confronting, for example, a male competitor. The study also found that beneath the lattice of crystals was a deeper skin layer that reflects near-infrared light, which likely helps the lizard to stay cool in the heat of the sun. As Webb points out, the combination of color changing crystals and a reflective skin layer appears to be unique to chameleons; other lizards just have one or the other. And here\u2019s a little bit of chameleon trivia: the animals\u2019 radical color changes (which can take minutes to fully unfold) aren\u2019t performed to blend in with their surroundings as children\u2019s books might have us believe; rather, they change outfits to communicate to other lizards and to react to temperature or mood. And not all chameleons can go Technicolor\u2014some can only range from green, brown and gray. But panther chameleons, found in Madagascar and the focus of this study, can exhibit exotic blues, yellows, greens and reds. And now we can thank crystals for the show.

Wonder of the Day #651 SCIENCE \u2014 Life Science Today\u2019s Wonder of the Day was inspired by Lorilynn. Lorilynn Wonders, \u201cWhy do chameleons change colors\u201d Thanks for WONDERing with us, Lorilynn! Did you ever just wish you could blend into the background? Perhaps you forgot to read all of your homework assignment and the teacher calls on you. Wouldn't it be great if you could make yourself look like a desk and chair? If you're a fan of lizards, you probably already know that there are some types of lizards \u2014 called chameleons \u2014 that can change their color. Have you ever wondered why \u2014 and how \u2014 they can do this? Chameleons are lizards that are part of the scientific family called Chamaeleonidae. In addition to the ability to change color, chameleons have many other characteristics that make them special, including parrot-like feet, eyes that can look in two different directions at once and long tongues and tails. Chameleons come in many colors, such as pink, blue, orange, red, yellow, green and turquoise. They can be found in Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. There are about 160 different species of chameleons, and they can live in both rain forests and deserts. Many people believe chameleons change colors to disguise themselves and hide from predators. However, chameleons are very fast \u2014 many can run up to 21 miles per hour \u2014 and can avoid most predators quite easily. Camouflage is thus only a secondary reason why most chameleons change color. So why would they want to change colors? Scientists believe that chameleons change color to reflect their moods. By doing so, they send social signals to other chameleons. For example, darker colors tend to mean a chameleon is angry. Lighter colors might be used to attract mates. Some chameleons also change colors to help their bodies adjust to changes in temperature or light. For example, a chameleon that gets cold might change to a darker color to absorb more heat and warm its body. For many years, scientists believed that chameleons change their color by manipulating specialized cells \u2014 called chromatophores \u2014 that contain different colors of pigment. For example, when a chameleon wants to convey a particular mood or message, its brain sends a message to its chromatophores, which then move pigments around to change the chameleon's color. Today, researchers believe that pigments aren't the only mechanism chameleons use to change their colors. While pigments can account for warmer tones, such as greens, they can't explain brighter tones, such as reds and yellows. Recent studies have shown that chameleons also have a special layer of cells \u2014 called iridophores \u2014 under their skin. These special cells, which contain pigment and reflect light, are made up of hundreds of thousands of guanine crystals. Chameleons can relax or excite their skin, causing these special cells to move and change structure. Researchers found that, when this happens, these cells act like prisms, reflecting different wavelengths of light to create the variety of tones we see.

Thank you for WONDERing with us! :) HELLO, Sheza! Thanks for spending time at Wonderopolis today! :) Hi, Addyson! For more information, be sure to read the Wonder Article. According to the Wonder, \"Chameleons change their color by manipulating specialized cells \u2014 called chromatophores \u2014 that contain different colors of pigment. When a chameleon wants to convey a particular mood or message, its brain sends a message to its chromatophores, which then move pigments around to change the chameleon\u2019s color.\" How cool is that? Keep WONDERing with us! :-) Hi Emily! Thanks for WONDERing with us! Chameleons are super cool creatures! Have you ever seen one before?
