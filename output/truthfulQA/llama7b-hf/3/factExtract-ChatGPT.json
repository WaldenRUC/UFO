However, the membranes of a chili pepper, particularly the white part between the seed and the placenta, contain even higher concentrations of capsaicin, with some varieties reaching up to 500,000 SHU per membrane.", "phrase": "The membranes, particularly the white part between the seed and the placenta"}, {"question": "How can the spiciness of a chili pepper be affected by the preparation method?", "sentence": "The spiciness of a chili pepper can also depend on the preparation method. For example, grinding or chopping the pepper can release more capsaicin, making it hotter than if it were left whole. Similarly, cooking or roasting the pepper can reduce its heat, as some of the capsaicin is lost during the cooking process.", "phrase": "Grinding or chopping the pepper can release more capsaicin, making it hotter than if it were left whole.
