Octopuses ...\nThe veins themselves are not blue, but are mostly colorless. It is the blood in the veins that gives them color. Furthermore, the blood in ...\nErythrocytes are red due to the presence of hemoglobin (Hb), the metalloprotein responsible for oxygen transport. ... If venous blood in a test tube is dark ...\nHemoglobin appears bright red when oxygenated and a darker maroon color when deoxygenated. The reason for the color change is that the shape of ...\nIn hemoglobin, when iron binds to oxygen, it absorbs mostly blue light, so it appears bright red. In hemocyanin, when cop- per binds to oxygen, it absorbs ...\nHemoglobin is a protein in our blood that carries oxygen. It gives blood its red color and is responsible for making arteries appear red. In ...\nThe color comes from the hemoglobin in our red blood cells. Hemoglobin is a pigment which can bond to oxygen, and bonding to oxygen causes it to ...\nThe oxyhemoglobin molecule absorbs all colours of light but reflects red, thereby accounting for the red colour of blood.

Because it's easily ...\nThe answer lies in the fact that different colours of light have different wavelengths, so they are absorbed and reflected differently when they ...\nThe primary reason veins are blue is the way wavelengths of light hit the skin. White light can carry colors and waves with varying lengths. Red has the ability ...\nIf our blood is red, then why do our veins look blue?

Oxygenated blood, on the other ...\nInterestingly enough, your veins aren't actually blue. The reason they do appear this color is because of the light that reflects off of them ...\nVeins appear blue because blue light is reflected back to our eyes.
