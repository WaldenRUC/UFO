This motion is known as the annual motion of the stars.", "phrase": "Diurnal motion of the stars, annual motion of the stars"}, {"question": "What is the main reason for the stars to appear to move across the sky?", "sentence": "One of the main reasons why stars appear to move across the sky is due to the Earth's rotation.", "phrase": "Earth's rotation"}, {"question": "What is the Earth's orbit around the Sun known as?", "sentence": "The Earth orbits around the Sun in a path known as an elliptical orbit.", "phrase": "Elliptical orbit"}, {"question": "What is the duration of the Earth's orbit around the Sun?", "sentence": "This orbit takes approximately 365 days to complete.", "phrase": "Approximately 365 days"}, {"question": "What is the distribution pattern of the stars in the sky?", "sentence": "The stars are distributed in a pattern that appears to be fixed in the sky.", "phrase": "Appears to be fixed in the sky"}]}
