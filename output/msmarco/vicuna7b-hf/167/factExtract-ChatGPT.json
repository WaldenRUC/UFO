Another study found that people with asthma who exercised in a warm, humid environment had fewer asthma symptoms than those who exercised in a cold, dry environment.", "phrase": "Some studies found that people with asthma who avoided cold air had fewer asthma attacks and symptoms"}, {"question": "What are the potential benefits of avoiding cold air for asthma?", "sentence": "While the science behind the link between cold air and asthma is not fully understood, there are several potential benefits of avoiding exposure to cold air for people with asthma. These include: Reduced inflammation: By avoiding exposure to cold air, people with asthma may be able to reduce inflammation in their airways, which can help to reduce asthma symptoms.", "phrase": "Reduced inflammation in airways which can help to reduce asthma symptoms"}]}
