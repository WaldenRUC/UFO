In addition, the elongated neck may also make it more difficult for the cheetah to turn quickly, which can be a disadvantage in hunting situations where the cheetah needs to change direction quickly to catch its prey.", "phrase": "Relatively weak neck not well-suited for supporting its head and body, less efficient in propelling itself forward, difficulty in turning quickly"}, {"question": "What does the elongated neck of the cheetah symbolize?", "sentence": "It is a reminder of the cheetah's unique evolutionary history and its adaptation to life in the African savannah.", "phrase": "A reminder of the cheetah's unique evolutionary history and its adaptation to life in the African savannah"}]}
