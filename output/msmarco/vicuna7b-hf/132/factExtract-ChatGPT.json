It is a simple and easy-to-use method that requires minimal assumptions. It is also a non-parametric method, which means that it does not require any assumptions about the distribution of the data. Additionally, moving average is a robust method that is not affected by outliers or extreme values in the data.", "phrase": "Simple, non-parametric, and robust method"}, {"question": "What are some limitations of using moving average?", "sentence": "However, there are also some limitations to the use of moving average. One limitation is that it is a backward-looking method that does not take into account future events or changes in the underlying factors that influence the data. Additionally, moving average is a static method that does not take into account changes in the trend over time.", "phrase": "Backward-looking and static method"}]}
