This is because over land, the surface is rougher and there are more obstacles that can disrupt the flow of the wind.", "phrase": "The surface is rougher and there are more obstacles"}, {"question": "How does the land surface temperature affect wind speed?", "sentence": "Additionally, the temperature of the land surface can also affect the wind speed. When the land surface is warmer than the air above it, the air will cool as it flows over the surface, causing the wind speed to slow down.", "phrase": "Causes the wind speed to slow down"}, {"question": "Why can the ocean surface temperature create faster wind speeds?", "sentence": "Additionally, the temperature of the ocean surface is generally cooler than the air above it, which can cause the air to warm as it flows over the surface. This can create a stronger pressure gradient force, resulting in faster wind speeds over the ocean compared to over land.", "phrase": "Creates a stronger pressure gradient force"}]}
