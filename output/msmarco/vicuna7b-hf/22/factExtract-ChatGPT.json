In addition, the lack of obstacles in the polar regions allows the aurora to be seen more clearly.", "phrase": "Earth's magnetic field is strongest there, and lack of obstacles allows easier visibility"}, {"question": "What determines the color of an aurora?", "sentence": "The color of the aurora depends on the type of gas that the particles collide with.", "phrase": "Type of gas the particles collide with, such as oxygen or nitrogen"}]}
