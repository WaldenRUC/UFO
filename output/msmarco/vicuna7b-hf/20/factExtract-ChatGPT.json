This can happen when antibiotics interfere with the communication between nerves and muscles, causing muscles to contract involuntarily. Another reason is that some antibiotics can cause a decrease in the levels of certain neurotransmitters, such as GABA, which are responsible for regulating muscle tone. Additionally, some antibiotics can cause a decrease in the levels of magnesium, which is important for muscle function.", "phrase": "By disrupting the normal functioning of muscles, interfering with nerve-muscle communication, decreasing neurotransmitter levels, and decreasing magnesium levels"}, {"question": "What can you do to prevent or manage muscle spasms caused by antibiotics?", "sentence": "If you are taking antibiotics and experience muscle spasms, there are several things you can do to prevent or manage these side effects. One option is to take your antibiotics at a different time of day to avoid interfering with your sleep cycle. This can help to reduce the risk of muscle spasms caused by disrupted sleep patterns.
