The temperature, salinity, and pH levels of the ocean are relatively stable, which means that marine animals are less likely to experience sudden changes in their environment that could be harmful to them.", "phrase": "Relatively stable temperature, salinity, and pH levels reduce the likelihood of sudden harmful changes in the environment."}, {"question": "How does the ocean provide a constant source of food for marine animals?", "sentence": "In addition, the ocean provides a constant source of food, which means that marine animals do not have to expend as much energy searching for food as terrestrial animals do.", "phrase": "The ocean provides a constant source of food, reducing the energy expended on finding food."}, {"question": "How does the slower metabolism of marine animals contribute to their longer lifespans?", "sentence": "Another factor that may contribute to the longer lifespans of marine animals is their slower metabolism. Marine animals tend to have a slower metabolism than terrestrial animals, which means that they require less energy to maintain their bodies. This slower metabolism may also help to protect marine animals from the effects of aging, as they are less likely to experience the rapid cellular damage that can occur with age.", "phrase": "Requires less energy to maintain their bodies and may help protect from rapid cellular damage with age."}]}
