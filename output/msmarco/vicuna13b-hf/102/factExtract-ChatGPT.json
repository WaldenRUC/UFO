One reason is that PVCs can cause a decrease in the amount of oxygen-rich blood that is carried to the body. When the heart beats abnormally, it can disrupt the normal flow of blood through the body, leading to a decrease in the amount of oxygen-rich blood that is available for the body's cells to use. This can cause shortness of breath, as the body is not receiving enough oxygen to function properly. Another reason why PVCs can cause shortness of breath is that they can lead to an increase in the workload of the heart. When the heart beats abnormally, it can cause the heart to work harder than normal in order to pump blood throughout the body. This increased workload can cause the heart to become fatigued, which can lead to shortness of breath. Finally, PVCs can cause a decrease in the amount of blood that is available for the body's cells to use. When the heart beats abnormally, it can cause a decrease in the amount of blood that is pumped out to the body.", "phrase": "They can cause a decrease in the amount of oxygen-rich blood, increase the workload of the heart, and decrease the amount of blood available for the body's cells"}]}
