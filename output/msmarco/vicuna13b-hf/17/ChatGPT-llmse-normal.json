[{"question": "What is ferritin?", "phrase": "A protein that stores iron in the body.", "predAns": "Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body", "predScore": "LLM", "oriLLMans": "Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body; Ferritin helps to diagnose and monitor iron-related conditions. It measures the amount of iron stored in your body. Low levels of ferritin indicate an iron deficiency, while high levels could indicate an iron overload disorder; Ferritin levels are important in diagnosing and monitoring iron-related conditions. Ferritin is a blood protein that contains iron. It is the primary form of iron stored inside the body, with about 20% of the body's ferritin being found in the spleen, 20% in the liver, and 1% in the bone marrow. Ferritin is used to help diagnose and monitor the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia. It is also sometimes used to help diagnose diseases associated with high levels of iron. Ferritin is a blood cell protein that contains stored iron. It is the most sensitive measure of the body's iron stores. It measures the level of a protein that stores iron in your body.
