It measures the amount of iron stored in your body. Low levels of ferritin indicate an iron deficiency, while high levels could indicate an iron overload disorder; Ferritin levels are important in diagnosing and monitoring iron-related conditions. Ferritin is a blood protein that contains iron. It is the primary form of iron stored inside the body, with about 20% of the body's ferritin being found in the spleen, 20% in the liver, and 1% in the bone marrow. Ferritin is used to help diagnose and monitor the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia. It is also sometimes used to help diagnose diseases associated with high levels of iron. Ferritin is a blood cell protein that contains stored iron. It is the most sensitive measure of the body's iron stores. It measures the level of a protein that stores iron in your body.

When iron levels are low, the body increases ferritin production to store more iron, and when iron levels are high, the body decreases production to prevent iron overload. Ferritin levels therefore provide a good indication of the body's iron stores and can help diagnose and monitor iron-related conditions such as iron deficiency anemia [1].\n\n[1] - Ferritin and iron; The importance of ferritin levels in diagnosing and monitoring iron-related conditions", "usage": 333}, "You are a question-answering expert.
