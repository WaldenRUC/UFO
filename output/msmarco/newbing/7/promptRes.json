This report was instrumental in Leopold finally relinquishing his private holdings in Africa. Leopold had held ownership of the Congolese state since 1885, granted to him by the Berlin Conference, in which he exploited its natural resources (mostly rubber) for his own private wealth. Through intercepted letters, Captain Hubert-Joseph Lothaire, the commander of the Congo Free State forces in the Ituri-campaign, learned that Charles Stokes (born in Dublin) was on his way from German East Africa to sell weapons to the Zanzibari slavers in the eastern Congo region. Stokes was arrested and taken to Captain Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a Drumhead court-martial. Stokes was found guilty of selling guns, gunpowder and detonators to the Congo Free State's Afro-Arab enemies. On 14 January 1895 he was sentenced to death and was hanged the next day (hoisted on a tree). To Lothaire, Charles Stokes was no more than a criminal whose hanging was fully justified. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister at the time, commented that if Stokes was in league with Arab slave-trading, then 'he deserved hanging'. Sir John Kirk, for years the British Consul in Zanzibar, remarked that \"he was no loss to us, although he was an honest man.\" The news of Stokes' execution was received with indifference by the British Foreign Office. When the German ambassador asked Sir Thomas H. Sanderson, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether the British government planned to take any steps regarding the execution of this \"well-known character\", Sanderson wrote: \"I do not quite understand why the Germans are pressing us.\" In August 1895, the attention of the British press was drawn to this case by Lionel Decle, a journalist for the Pall Mall Gazette. The press began to report on these events in great detail, The Daily News emphasized 'bloodthirsty precipitation', The Times a 'painful and disgraceful death', The Liverpool Daily Post 'horrified amazement through the British race', The Daily Telegraph 'death like a dog', adding, \"Have we all been wrong in believing that the most audacious foreigner \u2013 not to speak of any savage chief \u2013 would think once, twice and even trice, before he laid hands on a subject of Queen Victoria?\". As a result, the case became an international incident, better known as the Stokes Affair. Together, Britain and Germany pressured the Congo Free State to put Lothaire on trial, which they eventually did, a first trial was held in the city of Boma. The Free State paid compensation to the British (150,000 francs) and Germans (100,000 francs) and made it impossible by decree to impose martial law or death sentences on European citizens. Stokes's body was returned to his family. Lothaire was acquitted twice, first in April 1896 by a tribunal in Boma. In August 1896, the appeal was confirmed in Brussels by the Supreme Court of Congo, paving the way for the rehabilitation of Lothaire. The Stokes Affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State. It also damaged the reputation of King Leopold II of Belgium as a benevolent despot, which he had cultivated with so much effort. The case helped encourage the foundation of the Congo Reform Association \u2013 by Roger Casement and E. D. Morel \u2013 which in its turn put pressure on the Belgian government, which helped lead to the annexation of the Congo Free State by the Belgian state in 1908. For many years prior to the Casement Report there were reports from the Congo alleging widespread abuses and exploitation of the native population. In 1895, the situation was reported to Dr Henry Grattan Guinness (1861\u20131915), a missionary doctor. He had established the Congo-Balolo Mission in 1889, and was promised action by King Leopold later in 1895, but nothing changed. H. R. Fox-Bourne of the Aborigines' Protection Society had published Civilisation in Congoland in 1903, and the journalist E. D. Morel also wrote several articles about the Leopoldian government's behaviour in the Congo Free State. On 20 May 1903 a motion by the Liberal Herbert Samuel was debated in the British House of Commons, resulting in this resolution:... That the Government of the Congo Free State having, at its inception, guaranteed to the Powers that its Native subjects should be governed with humanity, and that no trading monopoly or privilege should be permitted within its dominions, this House requests His Majesty's Government to confer with the other Powers, signatories of the Berlin General Act by virtue of which the Congo\n\nquestion: Who wrote the Casement Report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Roger Casement", "usage": 1137}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

His report was published in 1904, confirmed Morel's accusations, and had a considerable impact on public opinion.

Casement convinced Morel to establish an organization for dealing specifically with the Congo question.

Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1885, under which much of Africa had been partitioned. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. While the Report was issued as a Command paper in 1904, and was laid before the Houses of Parliament, the original was not published in full until 1985, in an annotated book by two Belgian professors of the history of colonialism. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist political leader and statesman Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold II to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives). Despite these findings, Leopold managed to retain personal control of the Congo until 1908, when the Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration as the Belgian Congo.

The report publicly denounced the atrocious systems of the rubber terror which forced Africans to extract the rubber from lianas to the profit of the State or concessionaries. Published in Great Britain in 1904, the report caused great outrage. The impact of the report in Belgium, however, has been so far underexplored. William Roger Louis mentions the importance of this report to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime and to Belgium\u2019s takeover of the Congo. This position, however, is contested by Jules Marchal, who has stated in his work that \u201cthe king had not to fear a reaction from the Belgian public who showed little interest in the Congo.\u201d None of these studies, however, have looked in depth at the impact of the publication of the Casement Report on the official reactions and on popular opinion in Belgium. This paper seeks to do just that. Keywords Roger Casement, King L\u00e9opold II, Congo Free State, Casement Report, Belgian Congo, Belgium, Commission of Inquiry, anti-Congo campaigns Introduction In July 1903, Roger Casement, as part of his duties as British consul, set out on a journey to the rubber regions of the Congo Free State (henceforth \u201cCFS\u201d). In February 1904, the publication of his report on the harsh living conditions of the indigenous population aroused much indignation within official and popular spheres in Great Britain. Very quickly, Casement and Edmund Morel founded the Congo Reform Association (henceforth \u201cC.R.A\u201d) and proclaimed their goal of putting an end to King L\u00e9opold II\u2019s Congo. And thus started one of the first humanitarian campaigns, one which, in spite of the end of the Congo Free State and its annexation to Belgium in 1908, continued its efforts until 1913. In the wake of the publication of the report in Great Britain, two very different courses of action were put in place. The first was official: the governmental spheres aimed at keeping the balance among European nations and expressing courtesy towards allied countries. The second course of action concerned public opinion: the C.R.A stepped up their propaganda against the CFS in order to stir the hearts of the British people into action. The role of the Casement Report was very different in each case. Officially, Great Britain used it in the hopes of reopening the Congo question with the signatories of the Berlin Conference. For the British people, the Report was certainly the trigger for the creation of the C.R.A but was also quickly replaced both by testimonies, primarily of Protestant missionaries, and by Morel\u2019s multiple books and pamphlets on the ill-treatment of the indigenous population. If studies on Casement\u2019s life and actions are manifold, the analysis of the reception of Casement\u2019s report and its impact in Belgium are important and, yet, relatively neglected research areas. In addition, the passing remarks on the subject are largely contradictory. William Roger Louis argues that the report was a major factor in the end of the CFS: \u201cCasement\u2019s report and his establishment of the C.R.A.,\u201d writes Louis, \u201cwere two feats that contributed greatly to the eventual downfall of the Leopoldian system, and the annexation of the Congo by Belgium.\u201d Jules Marchal, however, expresses the opinion that, because the Belgian population showed \u201clittle interest in the Congo,\u201d its impact was de-facto insignificant. In his contribution, he nevertheless recognizes that the real impact of the Casement Report and its role in the end of the CFS can only be really understood and evaluated by looking at the official and popular spheres within Belgium itself. It is true that the Congolese question was, first and foremost, an issue within Belgian domestic political affairs. Since 1890, Belgium was heir to L\u00e9opold II; and, since 1901, the Belgian Parliament could have started the annexation procedure of the Congo Free State to Belgium, had it wished to do so. Internationally, too, this right was never questioned either by England or by the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference. If the anti-Congo campaign led by the C.R.A. is still remembered elsewhere today, in Belgium itself, it had very little impact, and this is for two main reasons: first, while Casement and Morel\u2019s campaign was a pressurizing factor in Great Britain, it was much less so in Belgium. And second, in a very practical sense, the working language of the report was English, which was at that time not particularly well-known in Belgium. And yet, by criticizing the CFS, Casement and Morel were attacking the King, something that did not leave the\n\nquestion: Who wrote the Casement Report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Roger Casement", "usage": 1081}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since its independence in 1830, Belgium has had a constitutional monarchy. The country has a rather liberal constitution, affording many freedoms to its citizens. One of its articles guarantees the freedom of press and stipulates that censorship can never be established, thereby engendering a quasi-absolute freedom of the press. Belgian society at the time of L\u00e9opold II was organized into different segments, each with their own ideology. There were three pillars at that time: catholic, liberal, and socialist. Each pillar had its own social institutions, including distinct political parties and newspapers. For each of these pillars, the chosen mouthpiece was the press. Political parties and newspapers were so tied up together that it was not uncommon to find parliamentarians, party leaders, and ministers as writers or newspaper editors. For example, the leader of the socialist party, Emile Vandervelde, was one of the columnists for Le Peuple; and the leader of the catholic party, Charles Woeste, was the editor-in-chief of La Revue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Circulation was good, given that about 68% of the population was literate in 1900. For these reasons, we believe that the press is an excellent indicator of the popular opinions of each of the different pillars towards the Casement Report, the anti-Congo campaigns, and the annexation of Congo to Belgium. For this article, we have chosen Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle as the representative of the catholic pillar, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the liberal mouthpiece, and Le Peuple as the expression of the socialist viewpoint. We have also included in the corpus Le Soir which defines itself as a neutral paper. Those press publications subsidized by the CFS such as La Belgique coloniale, L\u2019Etoile belge, and Le Petit Bleu have not been included in this study because their influence was not great on Belgian popular opinion. The debate on the CFS is not limited to popular reactions, and therefore we also consider the official reactions. At the time of the debate Brussels was the capital of two distinct states: Belgium and the CFS, which were only linked together by the figure of King L\u00e9opold II. Thus we scrutinize and discuss at length the reactions of both the Belgian officials and the Congolese administration. The Casement Report as a whole can be read as a travelogue. Casement wrote down his experiences and the personal testimonies of the people he met on his journey. And contrary to popular belief, the Casement Report is not a passionate denunciation of the CFS but rather a well-balanced one. Casement was not, in other words, denouncing at all costs. As Louis explains, the report is \u201cnot a verbally scathing denunciation of the Congo administration,\u201d but rather, it is \u201cunderstated.\u201d Finesse and nuance characterize Casement\u2019s approach. He recognizes the benefits of the Belgian presence on Congolese soil\u2014for instance, in the field of infrastructure\u2014and shares his concerns about the treatment of the indigenous population. The consul was horrified at the drastic depopulation of some areas, which he interpreted either as the outbreak of sleeping sickness, frequent in an African context, or the result of heavy migration to the French Congo. Casement describes the forced labor at the different concessionaries, including Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anversoise and Anglo-Belgian India Rubber company (hencefore Abir), and gives a precise description of the tax system that enslaved the population. In that particular context, he tells the story of a teenage boy, Epondo, who was missing a left hand. The boy\u2019s explanation was that his hand was cut off by a sentry, a Congolese auxiliary employed by the concessionary. Casement personally investigated his case and sent the sentry before the authorities. Casement had, of course, no way of assessing the accuracy of Epondo\u2019s testimony, an issue that will be used against him in later stages. Nevertheless, the Report remains a mirror to the situation of the CFS in 1903. This paper looks at the role and impact of the Casement Report in Belgium. Its assessment within Belgium will help us to understand the part that it played in the end of the CFS and the development of the Belgian Congo. Ultimately, we wish to complicate the connection between Casement\u2019s report and the end of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo, which up to this point has been overly simplified. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part looks at those reactions immediately following the publication of the report, which range from outright hostility to passionate support for the humanitarian cause. This first part also looks at the official responses from the CFS and the inquiry commission set up by the King, which together constitute the official documents of the debate. Casement\u2019s report then comes back in 1912 when the consul wrote another damning condemnation on his\n\nquestion: Who wrote the Casement Report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1100}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Of particular interest are the widely differing reactions to it. The last part of the analysis looks at the reception of the Casement Report at the time of the First World War, a time of propaganda and mythical representations. At this time, Belgians had yet another take on the Casement Report. The anti-Congo campaigns were relentless at this point, pushing Belgian citizens to support the King and to deny the atrocities that had taken place. In addition Casement had been hanged for treason by the British. These two factors combined led to a complete disavowal of the Report. I. Edmund Morel\u2019s Campaign and the Casement Report (1903-1904) The name of Roger Casement and the anti-Congo campaigns are inextricably linked. While being a document among many others condemning King L\u00e9opold\u2019s kingdom, Casement\u2019s report remains a touchstone in anti-Congo campaigns. The intensity of the reactions to the report can only be understood by looking at the context of the creation of the CFS and what it stood for. In his burning ambitions of expanding abroad, L\u00e9opold II did not have the support of the financial and political elites of the country. The different parliamentary majorities saw in this expansion project the endangerment of Belgium\u2019s neutrality, and/or a real danger for Belgium\u2019s neutrality. For the liberals, the immediate priority was to keep good relations with neighboring countries, mainly for the development of the economy. In opposition, the socialists denounced the exploitation of the masses both in the industries and in the colonies. And Belgium\u2019s catholic government of the time, while it did not want to get involved in the Congo question, welcomed the idea of establishing catholic missions abroad. Faced with such opposition, L\u00e9opold II decided to act as an individual. In 1870, the King took up the argument of the civilizing mission. His reputation as a philanthropist had been consistently growing both in Belgium and abroad. The King\u2019s humanitarian interest found echo in the Anglophone world that was thoroughly involved with the abolitionist cause. In other words, the civilizing mission had truly become the leitmotiv of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. For this reason, among others, the CFS would be under the gaze of international public opinion. At the outset, L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan was to operate without imposing customs or import duties. While this option proved to be positive for the creation of the CFS, financially it was untenable\u2014so untenable, in fact, that the King was forced to invest his own finances into the CFS. Debts kept growing and, on the verge of bankruptcy, the King decided to drastically change the economic policy of the CFS. Gone were the days of barter with the local population. Emphasis was now on the harvesting of goods, more specifically rubber and ivory. But this new system also led to the use of violence: the military force now came into play to make sure that the demands of harvesting were met. And with the use of the military force came a plethora of violent acts and atrocities, including rape, murder, and mutilation. The atrocities linked to the rubber trade were then not a sought-out politic of L\u00e9opold II, but rather an indirect consequence of his economic position. In 1895, a campaign\u2014in The Times, among others\u2014denounced the abuse in the CFS. Hearing of these allegations, the Belgian King promised changes and reforms and, in that way, managed to keep the reputation of the CFS intact\u2014that is, until the arrival on the scene of Edmund Morel. Hired by Sir Alfred Jones, business partner of L\u00e9opold II, Morel used his pen to defend the cause of ship-owners in Liverpool. As a clerk for the company Morel noticed that the ships leaving Belgium for the Congo carried guns, chains, and explosives but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the CFS came back full of valuable products such as rubber and ivory. This discovery led him to understand the exploitative nature of the regime. To defend the welfare of Africans, Morel launched his own newspaper\u2014The West African Mail\u2014to denounce the brutal exploitation of the natives. This new publication immediately drew the attention of the CFS. The association of Jones and Morel later fuelled the Belgian fantasy that claimed the merchants of Liverpool were plotting against the country. Morel played an important role in the adoption\u2014by the House of Commons on May 20, 1903\u2014of a motion suggested by British Liberal M.P. Herbert Samuel on the Congo question. Samuel\u2019s motion, based on humanitarian and economic arguments, hoped to reconvene the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference\u2014including Belgium\u2014to discuss once again the Congolese question. In Belgium, the\n\nquestion: Who wrote the Casement Report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Roger Casement", "usage": 1096}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  motion created a form of awkwardness and embarrassment, but not much more. Only Emile Vandervelde, emblematic figure of the socialist movement, and Georges Lorand, a liberal progressive politician, made a stand against the scandal that erupted in the CFS. The socialist deputy suggested to Paul de Favereau, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to intervene in order to shed light on the alleged atrocities. This proposal, however, was rejected on the grounds that Belgium cannot intervene in the affairs of another sovereign State. The very few reactions to this British motion reflected the disengagement that Belgium felt towards the Congo question. L\u00e9opold II did not wish to see the Congolese question placed on the agenda of European governments. The King, in a state of denial about the atrocities, considered these allegations as lies to serve a campaign of covetousness of the CFS by the \u201ccorsaire\u201d Morel, part of an attempt of the British to get their hands on the Congo Free State. The King then launched his own counter-propaganda. One of his first initiatives was to encourage the creation of the FEDIBE (La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration pour la Defense des Inter\u00eats Belges \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tranger) and that of its official organ, La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur le Congo. The drafting of these texts were naturally provided by the Congolese administration. Blamed for mistreatment towards the Congolese people, the King planned another initiative: the enactment of a law in October 1903 limiting the mandatory services of the indigenous people to around forty hours of work per month. Finally, the CFS answered the British motion in contemptuous terms suggesting that it was a plot organized by the merchants of Liverpool. The Congolese government did not suspect at this stage that Casement was authorized in September 1902 to make a journey to the Upper Congo. Early in 1903, Casement already gave a report on the inequalities of the system in place within the CFS. In May, he was appointed official investigator, and the Foreign Office, aware of the parliamentary debates on the Congo question, encouraged him to leave on his journey as soon as possible. On June 5, the Consul left Matadi. He followed the river and passed through L\u00e9opoldville (Kinshasa) and Coquilhatville (Mbandaka), two major cities in the CFS, but he also abandoned his river path to penetrate deeper into the African country. He spent three weeks at Lake Matumba (la Ntomba) that is located in the Domaine de la Couronne, personal property of King L\u00e9opold II. He also stayed for five days in Bongandanga, the ABIR station, on the Lopori River. This last week was crucial to Casement, as he thought he had collected enough material for his report. On September 11, he began his journey back to the Lower Congo and left the African continent to return to Europe on November 7th to begin his report. II. Belgian Reactions to the Casement Report a.1903-1906: The Casement Report and its Responses 1.December 1903\u2014Mid-March 1904: The Casement Report The British consul finalized Casement\u2019s report in December 1903, and it was published in February of the following year. The first official reactions were dated two months prior to the publication of the report. They were full of worry, fear, and suspicion. Pending the publication of the report, L\u00e9opold II threatened to reorient his policy to be closer to Germany. The King desperately wanted his hands on the report, and he sent Sir Alfred Jones, his associate in maritime affairs and consul of the CFS in Liverpool, twice to the Foreign Office to get an exclusive copy of it. In this atmosphere of great suspicion about England\u2019s ulterior motives in this report, the Count of Lalaing, who was Belgian ambassador in London, tried his best to reassure the governmental spheres that the English posed no threat to the Congo. To that end, Lalaing repeated the words of Lord Lansdowne that Britain did not wish to own any part of the CFS. And, upon sending the Casement Report to Brussels, Lalaing shared a confidence qualifying the Report\u2019s tone as fairly moderate. Of course, great was the ambassador\u2019s disappointment when the British press blatantly attacked the Congo and presented it on its front page news as hell on earth. In spite of these setbacks, the Belgian ambassador continued to work towards some form of appeasement between the various parties. During a dinner at Buckingham, for instance, he had a discussion with the Duke of Argyll, Edward VII\u2019s brother-in-law, who ultimately listened attentively to his claims. However, the relationship between the two ruling houses had, according to Edward VII, deteriorated, and it was not part of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan to improve\n\nquestion: Who wrote the Casement Report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Roger Casement", "usage": 1104}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  it. The King had become, as his close collaborators reveal, rather bitter in his later years, and it had become impossible for him to bear any contradiction. King L\u00e9opold\u2019s response to the Casement Report was vindictive. He warned the signatory members that the response of the CFS to the Casement Report would shed light on these allegations and establish the very circumstances reported by the British consul. His personal conviction was that \u201cles attaques exag\u00e9r\u00e9es de M. Casement contre les agents Congolais\u201d justified the word \u201clibel\u201d used by the Belgian consul in Liverpool, Edouard S\u00e8ve. Reprimanded by Foreign Affairs, S\u00e8ve\u2019s attitude was illustrative of the zeal of certain diplomats who wanted to get noticed by the Royal Palace, diplomats such as Charles Sarol\u00e9a, who directly opposed Morel. By contrast, Sir Alfred Jones adopted a rather different attitude towards the problem and strongly recommended avoiding controversy in relation to the Casement Report. Jones nevertheless remained extremely active in the Congo question and hired a number of people who, under the safe umbrella of neutrality, started conducting a number of counter-investigations. One of these people is Lord Mountmorres, an Irish peer who officially worked for the London journal, The Globe. The Irishman sent a report to the Foreign Office that he later published in book form. In his conclusion, Mountmorres made a case in favor of the Congolese administration. The CFS, he argued, was governed humanely. The blame of these atrocities, he continued in his report, fell on the greedy concessionaries. The CFS did not bear, therefore, more responsibility than any other colonial regime. The Belgian press\u2014except for the socialists\u2014mirrored these official concerns. Except for Le Peuple, most press organizations were highly critical of the Casement Report. Most of their reports were filled with downright hostility. The papers emphasized the only positive point in the report: that of the very much-improved state of the infrastructure and the abolishment of the slave trade. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle stressed \u201cl\u2019\u00e9nergie montr\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s belges\u201d to improve what they called, one of the wildest regions in Africa. The rest of their reports discredited both the man himself and his report. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge saw the report as having \u201cun caract\u00e8re tendencieux,\u201d mainly because Casement\u2019s trip lasted two months only, instead of the six that were officially planned. For the liberal paper, L\u00e9opold II accomplished \u201cune \u0153uvre de civilisation et de progr\u00e8s \u00e0 laquelle nulle autre n\u2019est comparable dans l\u2019ordre colonial.\u201d Le Soir, in an article dating back to December 1903, stated that Casement\u2019s work just amounted to \u201cune campagne de d\u00e9nigrement vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019Etat ind\u00e9pendant.\u201d Casement\u2019s findings relating to cruelty and oppression were directly discredited by referring to the counter-investigation carried out in the immediate aftermath of the publication by Marquis Bosco, judge in the CFS. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, compared Casement\u2019s and Bosco\u2019s findings, arguing in favor of the latter. According to the paper, while the English accused the Europeans of cruelty on the Congolese, Bosco demonstrated that these alleged cases of mutilation dated back more than ten years and therefore could not be the responsibility of Europeans. The discourse around British covetousness of the Congo imbued the newspaper articles. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, spoke of \u201cparti pris dans les affaires du Congo.\u201d Le Peuple was the only newspaper of those we examined that had another perspective on the Casement Report. The socialist paper presented the findings as facts \u201cdont l\u2019horreur fait fr\u00e9mir\u201d and wrote of \u201ccaoutchouc rouge.\u201d Le Peuple showed its true opposition to the system in the CFS after the publication of the inquiry commission. Reactions to the Casement Report were diverse in 1903. Except for Le Peuple, which stood for equal chances for all, the rest of these reactions\u2014both official and popular\u2014were shown to be quite distrustful of the report, often deeming it an exaggeration or a ploy to reconvene the Berlin Conference and discuss the Congo case. Words like \u201cexaggeration,\u201d \u201csuspicion,\u201d \u201cmistrust,\u201d \u201cBritish covetousness\u201d and \u201chorror\u201d were used to decry what Casement witnessed in and\n\nquestion: Who wrote the Casement Report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Casement", "usage": 1038}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It definitely led to passionate reactions among the Belgians, some feeling outrage at what they saw as an attack, and others feeling consternation at the treatment of the native population whom, according to the Berlin Conference, the Europeans were supposed to protect. 2.Mid-March 1904\u2014March 1905: Congo Free State Response The CFS gave its official response to the Casement Report on March 12, 1904. The suggestion made by the Congo Free State to conduct a private investigation into Casement\u2019s allegations\u2014just as Joseph Chamberlain had promised for the Fiji Islands\u2014caught the attention of the Foreign Office. This response, and its idea to launch a private investigation, was well-received by the Foreign Office. Francis Villiers, future British ambassador in Brussels, strongly recommended that this inquiry be led by an international commission. Bound by its statement, the Congo Free State sent three commissioners\u2014a Belgian, an Italian, and a Swiss\u2014to assess the situation in the country between October 1904 and February 1905. Neither Casement nor Morel believed in the efficiency of this commission, whose members were, in some form or other, connected to the King. The findings of the international commission were rather more nuanced than Casement\u2019s report. On the whole, it confirmed that atrocities were being committed on Congolese soil but presented the facts with their grey areas. They clearly established that the Epondo case was an exaggeration, a testimony that Casement failed to verify. The findings also suggested possible explanations for the type of behavior exhibited in the Congo (for example, climate, lack of morals, abuse of power, pressure for results). In general, their findings could be considered as more rational and nuanced than those of the Casement Report. In this period immediately following the Congo Free State response, each paper kept the stance that they had established towards the Casement Report. The Catholic and Liberal press emphasized the arguments that offered a more favorable vision of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. Both Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge published the report and were hoping that the response by the CFS would clear up \u201cun malentendu\u201d created by \u201cdes \u00e9l\u00e9ments anglais.\u201d Commenting upon the atrocities, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge wrote that these, which were at first considered as \u201cincontestables,\u201d had now been shown to be refutable. The paper illustrated its claims by means of two examples. First it discussed at length the well-known Epondo case, once the symbol of the oppression of the system and now simply the victim of a hunting accident. And second, in a later article, the paper discussed another mistake made by Casement. Casement had seen a dozen Congolese men travelling in a train carriage from L\u00e9opoldville to Matadi. They were tied up and controlled under the watchful eye of a soldier, leading the consul to believe they were involved in the rubber scandal. In point of fact, these people were a group of men condemned by the Court in Basoko who had come to Matadi to serve their sentence. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge confirmed its full support to the regime in the CFS and expressed its strong disagreement with the idea that the Congo administration led to \u201cun r\u00e9gime syst\u00e9matique de cruaut\u00e9s ou d\u2019oppression.\u201d The paper, nevertheless, acknowledged that some wrongdoings happened in the country, just as they had in any other colony. But then the paper immediately suggested a number of possible suggestions for these acts of cruelty. It argued that when such deeds had been committed, the perpetrators had been severely punished. It then advised its readers to bear in mind the difficulties Belgians had to face in the heart of Africa, a country with more than two hundred languages and where roads had yet to be built. According to L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, the English should have thought \u201caux difficult\u00e9s qui assaillent les officiers au Congo.\u201d It would be easy to condemn, wrote the paper, when \u201con est assis chez soi \u00e0 l\u2019abri du besoin.\u201d The English, therefore, should give some thought \u201c\u00e0 la mentalit\u00e9 de ces hommes bris\u00e9s de corps et d\u2019esprit dans une lutte perp\u00e9tuelle.\u201d Le Soir wrote a number of articles that defended the country against the Casement Report. In its issue of June 30, 1904, the newspaper interviewed Paul Landbeck, an official working in the CFS. Landbeck strongly contested all the allegations of the British consul against the Free State. His view was that the series of atrocities outlined by Casement were carried out fifteen or twenty years ago before the government stepped in to establish law and order. He put the responsibility\n\nquestion: Who wrote the Casement Report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Joseph Chamberlain", "usage": 1077}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He believed it \u201cimpossible\u201d that the hands were cut off by Europeans. Landbeck further argued that ill-treatment of the natives was severely punished in the CFS, and that there was no exploitation of the natives to collect rubber. There reigns in the Congo, according to the interviewee, \u201cun ordre parfait.\u201d His view was that \u201cl\u2019Etat remplit sa mission.\u201d The Belgian press continued to establish links between the Casement Report and English covetousness of the Congo. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge believed that the English started their anti-Congo campaigns at the time when the Free State was becoming an extremely prosperous state. The paper held the view that the English blamed the atrocities on the Congo administration with an ulterior motive, that of getting their hands on the Free State: A partir de 1895, le commerce de l\u2019Etat du Congo prend un essor marqu\u00e9, et le chiffre des exportations monte progressivement de 10 millions en 1895 \u00e0 50 millions en 1902. C\u2019est aussi \u00e0 partir d\u2019alors que le mouvement contre l\u2019Etat du Congo se dessine. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que l\u2019Etat affirmera davantage sa vitalit\u00e9 et ses progr\u00e8s, la campagne ira en s\u2019accentuant, s\u2019appuyant sur quelques cas particuliers et isol\u00e9s pour invoquer des pr\u00e9textes d\u2019humanit\u00e9 et dissimuler le v\u00e9ritable objectif des convoitises qui, dans leur impatience, se sont cependant trahies sous la plume des pamphl\u00e9taires et par la voix de membres de la Chambre des communes, mettant nettement en avant la disparition et le partage de l\u2019Etat du Congo. Le Peuple, however, faithful to its belief in a better treatment for all, continued to fight to expose the atrocities. It disagreed with the response by the Congo Free State and sided with Casement and English views on the issue. In June 1904, Le Peuple, to show its support to Casement, quoted at length three other sources in Sir Charles Dilke, English liberal politician, Sir John Garot, and Count Earl Percy, the British Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Dilke claimed that the Congo Free State was \u201cun enfer sur terre.\u201d Sir John Garot followed suit and argued that the country was \u201cune immense cuve dans laquelle fermentent les atrocit\u00e9s, les oppressions et les cruaut\u00e9s.\u201d The positions established in 1903-1904 continued in the same line of thought. Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle supported the response by the Congo Free State, relieving Belgium from blame in these allegations. The argument of British covetousness gathered momentum as the anti-Congo campaigns continued. Emile Vandervelde and Le Peuple, on the other hand, siding with the Casement Report, were still fighting for the defense of the native population in the Free State. Their campaign to expose the atrocities in the Congo Free State took its full measure in the next phase, in the response to the report of the inquiry commission. 3.March 1905 - November 1905: The Commission Report The inquiry commission came back in March 1905 from the Free State and its report was published in November 1905. Because it was published in the Bulletin Officiel, the official journal of the Congo Free State, this report was not accessible to the masses, but rather to a small minority of learned and interested people invested in the Congo question. In addition to the report\u2019s relative lack of visibility, the celebrations for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Belgian independence stirred up dormant patriotic feelings in Belgium. The two major political parties\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014touted the King\u2019s genius. The politicians were aware that an impressive program of embellishment and aggrandizement of Belgium had been made possible thanks to the Congo. The socialist leader, again bravely challenged the government about the atrocities against the native population but, just like in 1903, his concerns fell on deaf ears. The Congo question was compared by Lorand to the Dreyfus case in France. It had become impossible, according to the Liberal deputy, to treat the Congo question without being accused of treason towards Belgium or of collusion with the merchants of Liverpool. It was therefore of no surprise that these\n\nquestion: Who wrote the Casement Report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1059}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle corroborated the commission report, and, in their respective newspapers, primarily printed those findings of the commission that could speak for themselves. One newspaper, however, stood out. Le Peuple showed the full measure of its opposition to the Congo system. While Vandervelde\u2019s voice was not heard in the parliamentary debates, he expressed his views in his socialist newspaper. The socialist leader and his newspaper summarized and quoted the Casement Report in the hope of exposing the cruel system of oppression. They called for a \u201ccampagne de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de piti\u00e9.\u201d The paper focused largely on Abir. The argument against the atrocities was all the more striking since Casement\u2019s findings relating to those concessionaries like Abir were confirmed in the commission report. Le Peuple made a point at presenting in detail the atrocities inflicted on the population to collect the rubber. Le Peuple printed the testimony of victims who came to testify in front of the international commission. They heard the stories of families being taken hostage by Abir because the men did not fill their quota of rubber; they were told about the armed sentries threatening the rubber carriers; they heard the stories of horrific corporal punishment, including floggings and lashes with a chicotte against those that did not fulfill their quotas. The paper described \u201cles civilisateurs Congolais\u201d as follows: On tuait sans distinction les femmes inoffensives et les enfants  Tout cela apparemment pour frapper de terreur ce malheureux peuple et le forcer \u00e0 apporter du caoutchouc  Les t\u00e9moins racont\u00e8rent qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient constamment battus avec la chicotte et que leurs femmes et leurs enfants \u00e9taient continuellement emprisonn\u00e9s, beaucoup de gens mourant soit en prison, soit imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9s.

Il lui sera bien difficile d\u2019expier ses torts envers la population. This work of vulgarization and spreading of the Casement Report continued until 1906 when two major works vulgarized the commission report and thereby made it available to a much wider audience. The first of these major works was by liberal F\u00e9licien Cattier, Professor at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles; the other was by Father Vermeersch, a Jesuit. Interestingly, the vulgarization of the report came from two political strands\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014that were at the time staunch supporters of the Congo Free State. Father Vermeersch\u2019s book introduced catholic opinion to the possibility that the anti-Congo campaigns were not simply an attack against the Free State by Protestant missionaries. The annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium soon became a most viable solution. The proposal of annexation was taken so seriously that, led by Vandervelde, the debates were reopened on the Congo question in February 1906. Cattier\u2019s book and the commission report became the touchstones to start reforming the regime of the Congo Free State. During the discussion on the annexation of the Congo, references to Casement were rare, just as were those to Morel. A few days before the annexation in October 1908, Vandervelde once again emphasized the importance of the consul in this thorny issue. b.1910-1914: The Casement Report and the Putumayo Atrocities After his report on the CFS, Casement served as consul in various parts of the world, including Lisbon, the Brazilian port of Santos, followed by S\u00e3o Paulo, at the mouth of the Amazon. In July 1910, Edward Grey insisted that Casement be attached to a commission going to investigate reports of atrocities on the Putumayo River of the upper Amazon. What Casement found there was another oppressive regime. Agents of this regime, reported Casement, administrated inhumane treatment on the native population. Back in Britain, in January 1911, Casement submitted his detailed and damning report to the Foreign Secretary. The British government decided in July 1912 to publish Casement\u2019s report. It was subsequently published in the Belgian\n\nquestion: Who wrote the Casement Report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1041}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Through the lens of the Putumayo Report, new light is shed on a number of interesting remarks on the Casement Report. When the Putumayo Report was commented on in Belgium in July 1912, the status of the CFS had evolved. The annexation of the Congo in 1908 as a colony of Belgium, known as the Belgian Congo, along with the King\u2019s death in 1909, had changed the situation completely. Belgium put L\u00e9opold II on a pedestal and the episode of the red rubber was erased from people\u2019s memory. A striking example of this change in perception is the case of Emile Vandervelde: the man who exposed and condemned the atrocities of the Congo during the Parliamentary debates and in heated and passionate articles in Le Peuple became, after his trip to the Congo, a fervent supporter of the colony. His policies now connected socialism and colonialism by arguing that both these movements had the moral obligation of guardianship towards the less developed people. The socialist leader then distanced himself from Morel\u2019s campaign. From the Belgian perspective, however, the Putumayo Report fell at a bad time. In 1910-12, when the Congo Free State became the Belgian Congo, its new colonial administration reacted rather poorly to the allegations about the inability of the Belgians to rule the Congo. For the authorities of the newly-created Belgian Congo, England froze interference by pursuing its consular inquiries into the Congo. Through a fear either imagined or real, the Congo remained for the Belgian authorities a coveted colony. Important discussions were taking place between Lalaing and Grey regarding the recognition by the English of the annexation of the Congo Free State to Belgium. When Casement returned from Putumayo, Count Lalaing highlighted the similar attitude that London adopted towards the Congo Free State and the Peruvian government.  Upon publication of the Putumayo Report, the British press made allusions to the Congo case and stirred up ancient feuds between the two countries. The ambassador very much regretted that the press made \u201callusions aussi blessantes qu\u2019exag\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ancien r\u00e9gime Congolais.\u201d  If The Times mentioned that the situation was worse in Peru, Morel insisted in The Economist that nothing could be compared to the CFS. The annexation was finally recognized the following year, and Grey\u2019s speech on that occasion was welcomed by L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the clearing of reckless attacks. In contrast, the Belgian government deemed that England was much too slow in her recognition of the Belgian Congo. If Lalaing highlighted similar reactions on the part of London towards both of Casement reports, the press adopted a totally different stance to Casement\u2019s Putumayo Report. There were no connections established in the papers about the fact that both reports were from the same pen. The press treated these two reports as totally distinct. Another striking difference was that, while the Casement Report was passionately debated and condemned as false (apart from a few) between 1903 and 1906, the Putumayo Report was presented in a detached manner, very matter-of-factly. The reports in Le Soir and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle took the form of factual lists of atrocities committed by the Peruvian Amazon Company on the indigenous population to collect rubber in all their excruciating details. The comparison of the treatment established two important facts: the first one was that there was indeed a complete amnesia in Belgium about the Congo atrocities. Not one reference was made to Casement, the damned and criticized author of the report on the CFS. And secondly, the difference in treatments highlighted the fact that, between 1903 and 1906, there was a passionate debate about the Congo question. The Casement Report, contrary to what Jules Marchal argues, did trigger interest and passionate debate among the Belgian population. c.1914-1918: The Casement Report and the Great War At the time of the outbreak of the Great War, Casement was retired. This retirement, however, was rather short lived. He turned his interest to Ireland\u2019s political turmoil. In 1914 Ireland, different political factions opposed each other on the issue of Home Rule, which would grant a Dublin government for the whole of Ireland. Unionists opposed the bill because they feared a loss of power; constitutional nationalists and John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, supported the Home Rule bill. To put actions into words, he urged Irishmen to enlist in the British army. Within the nationalists, there was a more radical Republican wing that included well-known names such as Patrick Pearse, Thomas Clarke, Sean McDermott, and\u2026Roger Casement. The former British consul had decided to fight alongside the republicans in the hope of the birth of an independent Ireland, free and not part of any Empire. Casement sought to obtain German support for a rebellion against English rule\u2014the Easter Rising. Shortly before\n\nquestion: Who wrote the Casement Report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Roger Casement", "usage": 1106}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was convicted and executed for treason. Casement\u2019s involvement in these republican activities ultimately had a profound effect on the perspective of the Casement Report within Belgium. There were very few official responses to Casement\u2019s fate. Casement\u2019s involvement in the Easter Rising and his subsequent arrest were barely mentioned by the Belgian embassy in London. The Belgian Congo\u2019s mother country was deemed at this time \u201cpoor little Belgium,\u201d a country that the British needed to rescue after the German invasion of its territory. Despite the laudatory speeches and gestures of support, King Albert and the Belgian government were deeply concerned by the German occupation of Belgium and by the possible damage to the integrity of the national territory both of Belgium and of the Belgian Congo after the conflict. In this time of great crisis for Belgium, Casement\u2019s trial was not an object of interest for Belgian officials. Instead of going back to ancient feuds, the ambassador, Paul Hymans, worked towards the organization of two Anglo-Belgian events that would demonstrate the intimate friendship between the two countries. Success was complete, and Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, in his speeches, glorified the Belgian attitude. By coincidence, the two events took place shortly before and after Casement\u2019s execution on August 3, 1916. Then, too, the execution of the former consul was not exploited by Belgian officials. Hymans\u2019 personality played a big role in that fact. Following the publication of Morel\u2019s Truth and the War at the end of August, part of the public opinion\u2014including British\u2014was struck by the coincidence between Morel\u2019s statements in 1911, in which he advocated for an Anglo-German rapprochement on the basis of the sharing of the Congo, and the revelations at Casement\u2019s trial. From there emerged the idea that Morel and Casement were agents in the service of Germany, whose aim it was to create tensions between Belgium and Great Britain on the Congo question. This development, however, was rejected by the ambassador, who trusted history to decide on the issue. However, three important elements reversed the situation completely: first, the creation of a propaganda division at the ministry of the colonies in 1916; second, Morel\u2019s condemnation in 1917; and third, the need to look victimized at the peace conference. Now Minister of Foreign affairs, Hymans signed a note for the diplomats, prepared by Octave Louwers. If Louwers, as a young magistrate in the Congo Free State, denounced L\u00e9opold II as a scoundrel, the minister\u2019s adviser suggested not to be intimidated by the memory of the \u201catrocities,\u201d because if L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime had not been faultless, its benefits were too long overshadowed by the accusations orchestrated by questionable characters. Sir Herbert Samuel, author of the motion in May 1903, bowed a quarter of a century later in front of the Belgian work that was now at the forefront of progressive and enlightened colonial administrations. The myth that Morel and Casement were agents of Germany resurged throughout the whole period of the Belgian Congo. While there were very few references to Casement\u2019s fate in the official spheres, the press, on the other hand, turned the Casement\u2019s trial and his hanging into its main headlines. Casement was, in the Belgian press, a \u201ctra\u00eetre.\u201d Le Soir, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge reported Casement\u2019s arrest in every detail, branding him as \u201cIrlando-Boche,\u201d \u201cun agent de l\u2019Allemagne\u201d, and \u201cinventeur et le colporteur de l\u2019abominable l\u00e9gende des \u2018mains coup\u00e9es\u2019.\u201d With an ironic twist, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle asked \u201co\u00f9 sont ces belles d\u00e9clamations sur les atrocit\u00e9s congolaise, sur le \u2018caoutchouc rouge,\u2019 les vibrantes tirades humanitaires?\u201d The journalist compared Casement to a character in a Charles Dickens novel: Il y a dans un roman de Dickens une brave dame qui passe son temps \u00e0 s\u2019occuper des indig\u00e8nes de Borrisbola-Ghaa sur la c\u00f4te d\u2019Afrique\u2014mais qui oublie totalement l\u2019existence de son mari et de ses enfants. Le sieur Casement rappelle cette bonne femme, avec l\u2019infamie en plus. Casement\u2019s friendship with Germany was outlined in every article. Le Soir told Casement\u2019s story from the\n\nquestion: Who wrote the Casement Report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Casement Report was written by Roger Casement.", "usage": 1040}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The latter was in favor of Casement\u2019s suggestion to build an army from Irish prisoners of war to fight for the Irish cause. Casement\u2019s treason threw into doubt all the allegations that he made in 1903 on the Belgian administration of the CFS. In light of these events, the Casement Report was completely nullified by the Belgian society of the Great War. Casement\u2019s alignment with Germany was, to the papers, further proof that this man was not to be trusted and that his report was just a pack of lies. In Le Soir, for instance, dating back to April 1916, Casement\u2019s report was fully discredited: \u201cLa plupart des horribles \u00e9pisodes racont\u00e9s par cet \u00e9trange consul \u00e9taient exag\u00e9r\u00e9s et en partie invent\u00e9s  Il \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 ma\u00eetre dans l\u2019art de truquer les photographies et de falsifier les documents.\u201d British attitudes completely changed with regards to the Casement Report. The British that had proclaimed for all the world to hear the atrocities that were taking place in the Belgian Congo now apologized for being \u201cduped\u201d by the traitor Casement. Le Soir reported that the British press expressed \u201cun vif regret d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 entrain\u00e9e par ce tra\u00eetre.\u201d Casement\u2019s report was now being perceived a tool to create a gap between Belgium and England for the benefit of Germany. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle wrote passionately about this particular issue: Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de brouiller la Belgique et l\u2019Angleterre, et, par surcroit la France et l\u2019Angleterre? Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats politiques de l\u2019Allemagne, int\u00e9r\u00eats continentaux et int\u00e9r\u00eats coloniaux compris? Il est grand temps que la r\u00e9putation de la Belgique \u2018calomni\u00e9e\u2019 dans cette affaire, soit enfin r\u00e9habilit\u00e9e. In the light of these events, Belgian papers presented the Belgian Congo colony as being coveted by Germany. Le Soir, for one, wrote that \u201cMorel et Casement  travaillaient \u00e0 d\u00e9pouiller la Belgique de sa colonie, au profit de l\u2019Allemagne.\u201d All in all Casement\u2019s treason was, for Belgium and the Belgian Congo, holy bread. L\u00e9opold II and his humanitarian work in the Congo was now restored to good faith. L\u00e9opold II got his revenge, and the Belgian Congo, former Congo Free State, was reestablished among the model colonies in Africa. L\u00e9opold\u2019s \u0153uvre was \u201cveng\u00e9e des accusations du tra\u00eetre Casement,\u201d  wrote Le Soir. For those living in 1905 and 1906, when L\u00e9opold II was \u201cl\u2019objet d\u2019inf\u00e2mes outrages dans la presse \u00e9trang\u00e8re,\u201d these revelations were \u201cune \u00e9clatante revanche et une grande consolation.\u201d \u201cQuelle revanche,\u201d wrote Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, \u201cpour L\u00e9opold II et nos h\u00e9ros africains que les campagnes des complices de la barbarie allemande avaient r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire passer, m\u00eame aux yeux de certains de leurs compatriotes, pour de monstrueux criminels.\u201d III. Conclusion Roger Casement\u2019s report and the end of the CFS are considered today to be intrinsically connected to one another, the former leading to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo. This connection, however, as this paper hopes to have shown, is much more in the realm of myth than it is of actual historical reality. The direct link that exists in popular imagination between the report and the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo is a simplification of the role and impact of Casement\u2019s denunciatory report. Casement\u2019s report is first and foremost the work of an emphatic man who wished to denounce the suffering of the Congolese population. In Great Britain and the Anglophone world as a whole, the report had a great impact upon both the political and popular spheres of the country. Such an impact can be understood within the recurrent charges of maladministration that took place on L\u00e9opold\u2019s territory since 1895. Casement\u2019s report kindled the spark to this fire of\n\nquestion: Who wrote the Casement Report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Roger Casement", "usage": 1019}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In Belgium, however, the role and impact of the Casement Report was of a totally different nature. Political opinions oscillated between rejection of the report and support for its humanitarian concerns. Belgian socialists and liberals never hesitated in condemning the abuse taking place in the CFS, while the catholics cast a great shadow over the truth and veracity of Casement\u2019s statements. The use of a foreign report, however, was not acceptable within Belgian politics and an enquiry commission was established. The debate, therefore, was not on the basis of Casement\u2019s report, but rather on that of the enquiry commission. The Casement Report was but a piece in the domino effect that led to the annexation of the Congo to Belgium. Even after the annexation, the relentless attack upon L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo awakened Belgium\u2019s national pride. As a reaction there was a phenomenon of collective amnesia concerning the abuse, and L\u00e9opold II was put on a pedestal. The outbreak of the First World War resuscitated the figure of Roger Casement in yet another perspective. The Great War was a time of propaganda where partial truths are turned into patriotic dogmas. With the growing feeling of Belgian national pride, the country framed itself sympathetically with the hanging of Roger Casement by the British authorities for treason. The papers once again insisted on Casement\u2019s report as a pack of lies intended to steal the Congo away from Belgium. Today still, former Belgian colonials look upon Casement\u2019s report as exaggerated and his campaign as mainly anti-Belgian. In the end, the anti-Congo campaign created a dualistic representation of the CFS, one that has been taken up in literature by Adam Hochschild and Mario Vargas Llosa, both of whom represent Casement as the martyr of the humanitarian cause. This image of Casement as a martyr cannot be applied to Roger Casement, who was, and will always remain, a privileged witness of L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo.

As the State asserted more and more its vitality and progress, the campaign will keep on growing, relying on some specific and isolated cases to invoke humanity as a pretext to conceal the true objective of their envy.

This report was instrumental in Leopold finally relinquishing his private holdings in Africa. Leopold had held ownership of the Congolese state since 1885, granted to him by the Berlin Conference, in which he exploited its natural resources (mostly rubber) for his own private wealth. Through intercepted letters, Captain Hubert-Joseph Lothaire, the commander of the Congo Free State forces in the Ituri-campaign, learned that Charles Stokes (born in Dublin) was on his way from German East Africa to sell weapons to the Zanzibari slavers in the eastern Congo region. Stokes was arrested and taken to Captain Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a Drumhead court-martial. Stokes was found guilty of selling guns, gunpowder and detonators to the Congo Free State's Afro-Arab enemies. On 14 January 1895 he was sentenced to death and was hanged the next day (hoisted on a tree). To Lothaire, Charles Stokes was no more than a criminal whose hanging was fully justified. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister at the time, commented that if Stokes was in league with Arab slave-trading, then 'he deserved hanging'. Sir John Kirk, for years the British Consul in Zanzibar, remarked that \"he was no loss to us, although he was an honest man.\" The news of Stokes' execution was received with indifference by the British Foreign Office. When the German ambassador asked Sir Thomas H. Sanderson, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether the British government planned to take any steps regarding the execution of this \"well-known character\", Sanderson wrote: \"I do not quite understand why the Germans are pressing us.\" In August 1895, the attention of the British press was drawn to this case by Lionel Decle, a journalist for the Pall Mall Gazette. The press began to report on these events in great detail, The Daily News emphasized 'bloodthirsty precipitation', The Times a 'painful and disgraceful death', The Liverpool Daily Post 'horrified amazement through the British race', The Daily Telegraph 'death like a dog', adding, \"Have we all been wrong in believing that the most audacious foreigner \u2013 not to speak of any savage chief \u2013 would think once, twice and even trice, before he laid hands on a subject of Queen Victoria?\". As a result, the case became an international incident, better known as the Stokes Affair. Together, Britain and Germany pressured the Congo Free State to put Lothaire on trial, which they eventually did, a first trial was held in the city of Boma. The Free State paid compensation to the British (150,000 francs) and Germans (100,000 francs) and made it impossible by decree to impose martial law or death sentences on European citizens. Stokes's body was returned to his family. Lothaire was acquitted twice, first in April 1896 by a tribunal in Boma. In August 1896, the appeal was confirmed in Brussels by the Supreme Court of Congo, paving the way for the rehabilitation of Lothaire. The Stokes Affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State. It also damaged the reputation of King Leopold II of Belgium as a benevolent despot, which he had cultivated with so much effort. The case helped encourage the foundation of the Congo Reform Association \u2013 by Roger Casement and E. D. Morel \u2013 which in its turn put pressure on the Belgian government, which helped lead to the annexation of the Congo Free State by the Belgian state in 1908. For many years prior to the Casement Report there were reports from the Congo alleging widespread abuses and exploitation of the native population. In 1895, the situation was reported to Dr Henry Grattan Guinness (1861\u20131915), a missionary doctor. He had established the Congo-Balolo Mission in 1889, and was promised action by King Leopold later in 1895, but nothing changed. H. R. Fox-Bourne of the Aborigines' Protection Society had published Civilisation in Congoland in 1903, and the journalist E. D. Morel also wrote several articles about the Leopoldian government's behaviour in the Congo Free State. On 20 May 1903 a motion by the Liberal Herbert Samuel was debated in the British House of Commons, resulting in this resolution:... That the Government of the Congo Free State having, at its inception, guaranteed to the Powers that its Native subjects should be governed with humanity, and that no trading monopoly or privilege should be permitted within its dominions, this House requests His Majesty's Government to confer with the other Powers, signatories of the Berlin General Act by virtue of which the Congo\n\nquestion: What was the response to persistent allegations of abuse and exploitation in the Congo Free State?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "creation of the Congo Reform Association", "usage": 1150}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

His report was published in 1904, confirmed Morel's accusations, and had a considerable impact on public opinion. Casement met and became friends with Morel just before the publication of his report in 1904 and realized that he had found the ally he had sought. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organization for dealing specifically with the Congo question. With Casement's and Dr. Guinness's assistance, he set up and ran the Congo Reform Association, which worked to end Leopold's control of the Congo Free State.

Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1885, under which much of Africa had been partitioned. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. While the Report was issued as a Command paper in 1904, and was laid before the Houses of Parliament, the original was not published in full until 1985, in an annotated book by two Belgian professors of the history of colonialism. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist political leader and statesman Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold II to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives). Despite these findings, Leopold managed to retain personal control of the Congo until 1908, when the Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration as the Belgian Congo.

The report publicly denounced the atrocious systems of the rubber terror which forced Africans to extract the rubber from lianas to the profit of the State or concessionaries. Published in Great Britain in 1904, the report caused great outrage. The impact of the report in Belgium, however, has been so far underexplored. William Roger Louis mentions the importance of this report to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime and to Belgium\u2019s takeover of the Congo. This position, however, is contested by Jules Marchal, who has stated in his work that \u201cthe king had not to fear a reaction from the Belgian public who showed little interest in the Congo.\u201d None of these studies, however, have looked in depth at the impact of the publication of the Casement Report on the official reactions and on popular opinion in Belgium. This paper seeks to do just that. Keywords Roger Casement, King L\u00e9opold II, Congo Free State, Casement Report, Belgian Congo, Belgium, Commission of Inquiry, anti-Congo campaigns Introduction In July 1903, Roger Casement, as part of his duties as British consul, set out on a journey to the rubber regions of the Congo Free State (henceforth \u201cCFS\u201d). In February 1904, the publication of his report on the harsh living conditions of the indigenous population aroused much indignation within official and popular spheres in Great Britain. Very quickly, Casement and Edmund Morel founded the Congo Reform Association (henceforth \u201cC.R.A\u201d) and proclaimed their goal of putting an end to King L\u00e9opold II\u2019s Congo. And thus started one of the first humanitarian campaigns, one which, in spite of the end of the Congo Free State and its annexation to Belgium in 1908, continued its efforts until 1913. In the wake of the publication of the report in Great Britain, two very different courses of action were put in place. The first was official: the governmental spheres aimed at keeping the balance among European nations and expressing courtesy towards allied countries. The second course of action concerned public opinion: the C.R.A stepped up their propaganda against the CFS in order to stir the hearts of the British people into action. The role of the Casement Report was very different in each case. Officially, Great Britain used it in the hopes of reopening the Congo question with the signatories of the Berlin Conference. For the British people, the Report was certainly the trigger for the creation of the C.R.A but was also quickly replaced both by testimonies, primarily of Protestant missionaries, and by Morel\u2019s multiple books and pamphlets on the ill-treatment of the indigenous population. If studies on Casement\u2019s life and actions are manifold, the analysis of the reception of Casement\u2019s report and its impact in Belgium are important and, yet, relatively neglected research areas. In addition, the passing remarks on the subject are largely contradictory. William Roger Louis argues that the report was a major factor in the end of the CFS: \u201cCasement\u2019s report and his establishment of the C.R.A.,\u201d writes Louis, \u201cwere two feats that contributed greatly to the eventual downfall of the Leopoldian system, and the annexation of the Congo by Belgium.\u201d Jules Marchal, however, expresses the opinion that, because the Belgian population showed \u201clittle interest in the Congo,\u201d its impact was de-facto insignificant. In his contribution, he nevertheless recognizes that the real impact of the Casement Report and its role in the end of the CFS can only be really understood and evaluated by looking at the official and popular spheres within Belgium itself. It is true that the Congolese question was, first and foremost, an issue within Belgian domestic political affairs. Since 1890, Belgium was heir to L\u00e9opold II; and, since 1901, the Belgian Parliament could have started the annexation procedure of the Congo Free State to Belgium, had it wished to do so. Internationally, too, this right was never questioned either by England or by the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference. If the anti-Congo campaign led by the C.R.A. is still remembered elsewhere today, in Belgium itself, it had very little impact, and this is for two main reasons: first, while Casement and Morel\u2019s campaign was a pressurizing factor in Great Britain, it was much less so in Belgium. And second, in a very practical sense, the working language of the report was English, which was at that time not particularly well-known in Belgium. And yet, by criticizing the CFS, Casement and Morel were attacking the King, something that did not leave the\n\nquestion: What was the response to persistent allegations of abuse and exploitation in the Congo Free State?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The report caused great outrage in Great Britain.", "usage": 1097}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since its independence in 1830, Belgium has had a constitutional monarchy. The country has a rather liberal constitution, affording many freedoms to its citizens. One of its articles guarantees the freedom of press and stipulates that censorship can never be established, thereby engendering a quasi-absolute freedom of the press. Belgian society at the time of L\u00e9opold II was organized into different segments, each with their own ideology. There were three pillars at that time: catholic, liberal, and socialist. Each pillar had its own social institutions, including distinct political parties and newspapers. For each of these pillars, the chosen mouthpiece was the press. Political parties and newspapers were so tied up together that it was not uncommon to find parliamentarians, party leaders, and ministers as writers or newspaper editors. For example, the leader of the socialist party, Emile Vandervelde, was one of the columnists for Le Peuple; and the leader of the catholic party, Charles Woeste, was the editor-in-chief of La Revue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Circulation was good, given that about 68% of the population was literate in 1900. For these reasons, we believe that the press is an excellent indicator of the popular opinions of each of the different pillars towards the Casement Report, the anti-Congo campaigns, and the annexation of Congo to Belgium. For this article, we have chosen Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle as the representative of the catholic pillar, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the liberal mouthpiece, and Le Peuple as the expression of the socialist viewpoint. We have also included in the corpus Le Soir which defines itself as a neutral paper. Those press publications subsidized by the CFS such as La Belgique coloniale, L\u2019Etoile belge, and Le Petit Bleu have not been included in this study because their influence was not great on Belgian popular opinion. The debate on the CFS is not limited to popular reactions, and therefore we also consider the official reactions. At the time of the debate Brussels was the capital of two distinct states: Belgium and the CFS, which were only linked together by the figure of King L\u00e9opold II. Thus we scrutinize and discuss at length the reactions of both the Belgian officials and the Congolese administration. The Casement Report as a whole can be read as a travelogue. Casement wrote down his experiences and the personal testimonies of the people he met on his journey. And contrary to popular belief, the Casement Report is not a passionate denunciation of the CFS but rather a well-balanced one. Casement was not, in other words, denouncing at all costs. As Louis explains, the report is \u201cnot a verbally scathing denunciation of the Congo administration,\u201d but rather, it is \u201cunderstated.\u201d Finesse and nuance characterize Casement\u2019s approach. He recognizes the benefits of the Belgian presence on Congolese soil\u2014for instance, in the field of infrastructure\u2014and shares his concerns about the treatment of the indigenous population. The consul was horrified at the drastic depopulation of some areas, which he interpreted either as the outbreak of sleeping sickness, frequent in an African context, or the result of heavy migration to the French Congo. Casement describes the forced labor at the different concessionaries, including Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anversoise and Anglo-Belgian India Rubber company (hencefore Abir), and gives a precise description of the tax system that enslaved the population. In that particular context, he tells the story of a teenage boy, Epondo, who was missing a left hand. The boy\u2019s explanation was that his hand was cut off by a sentry, a Congolese auxiliary employed by the concessionary. Casement personally investigated his case and sent the sentry before the authorities. Casement had, of course, no way of assessing the accuracy of Epondo\u2019s testimony, an issue that will be used against him in later stages. Nevertheless, the Report remains a mirror to the situation of the CFS in 1903. This paper looks at the role and impact of the Casement Report in Belgium. Its assessment within Belgium will help us to understand the part that it played in the end of the CFS and the development of the Belgian Congo. Ultimately, we wish to complicate the connection between Casement\u2019s report and the end of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo, which up to this point has been overly simplified. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part looks at those reactions immediately following the publication of the report, which range from outright hostility to passionate support for the humanitarian cause. This first part also looks at the official responses from the CFS and the inquiry commission set up by the King, which together constitute the official documents of the debate. Casement\u2019s report then comes back in 1912 when the consul wrote another damning condemnation on his\n\nquestion: What was the response to persistent allegations of abuse and exploitation in the Congo Free State?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1110}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Of particular interest are the widely differing reactions to it. The last part of the analysis looks at the reception of the Casement Report at the time of the First World War, a time of propaganda and mythical representations. At this time, Belgians had yet another take on the Casement Report. The anti-Congo campaigns were relentless at this point, pushing Belgian citizens to support the King and to deny the atrocities that had taken place. In addition Casement had been hanged for treason by the British. These two factors combined led to a complete disavowal of the Report. I. Edmund Morel\u2019s Campaign and the Casement Report (1903-1904) The name of Roger Casement and the anti-Congo campaigns are inextricably linked. While being a document among many others condemning King L\u00e9opold\u2019s kingdom, Casement\u2019s report remains a touchstone in anti-Congo campaigns. The intensity of the reactions to the report can only be understood by looking at the context of the creation of the CFS and what it stood for. In his burning ambitions of expanding abroad, L\u00e9opold II did not have the support of the financial and political elites of the country. The different parliamentary majorities saw in this expansion project the endangerment of Belgium\u2019s neutrality, and/or a real danger for Belgium\u2019s neutrality. For the liberals, the immediate priority was to keep good relations with neighboring countries, mainly for the development of the economy. In opposition, the socialists denounced the exploitation of the masses both in the industries and in the colonies. And Belgium\u2019s catholic government of the time, while it did not want to get involved in the Congo question, welcomed the idea of establishing catholic missions abroad. Faced with such opposition, L\u00e9opold II decided to act as an individual. In 1870, the King took up the argument of the civilizing mission. His reputation as a philanthropist had been consistently growing both in Belgium and abroad. The King\u2019s humanitarian interest found echo in the Anglophone world that was thoroughly involved with the abolitionist cause. In other words, the civilizing mission had truly become the leitmotiv of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. For this reason, among others, the CFS would be under the gaze of international public opinion. At the outset, L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan was to operate without imposing customs or import duties. While this option proved to be positive for the creation of the CFS, financially it was untenable\u2014so untenable, in fact, that the King was forced to invest his own finances into the CFS. Debts kept growing and, on the verge of bankruptcy, the King decided to drastically change the economic policy of the CFS. Gone were the days of barter with the local population. Emphasis was now on the harvesting of goods, more specifically rubber and ivory. But this new system also led to the use of violence: the military force now came into play to make sure that the demands of harvesting were met. And with the use of the military force came a plethora of violent acts and atrocities, including rape, murder, and mutilation. The atrocities linked to the rubber trade were then not a sought-out politic of L\u00e9opold II, but rather an indirect consequence of his economic position. In 1895, a campaign\u2014in The Times, among others\u2014denounced the abuse in the CFS. Hearing of these allegations, the Belgian King promised changes and reforms and, in that way, managed to keep the reputation of the CFS intact\u2014that is, until the arrival on the scene of Edmund Morel. Hired by Sir Alfred Jones, business partner of L\u00e9opold II, Morel used his pen to defend the cause of ship-owners in Liverpool. As a clerk for the company Morel noticed that the ships leaving Belgium for the Congo carried guns, chains, and explosives but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the CFS came back full of valuable products such as rubber and ivory. This discovery led him to understand the exploitative nature of the regime. To defend the welfare of Africans, Morel launched his own newspaper\u2014The West African Mail\u2014to denounce the brutal exploitation of the natives. This new publication immediately drew the attention of the CFS. The association of Jones and Morel later fuelled the Belgian fantasy that claimed the merchants of Liverpool were plotting against the country. Morel played an important role in the adoption\u2014by the House of Commons on May 20, 1903\u2014of a motion suggested by British Liberal M.P. Herbert Samuel on the Congo question. Samuel\u2019s motion, based on humanitarian and economic arguments, hoped to reconvene the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference\u2014including Belgium\u2014to discuss once again the Congolese question. In Belgium, the\n\nquestion: What was the response to persistent allegations of abuse and exploitation in the Congo Free State?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The atrocities linked to the rubber trade led to the use of violence: the military force now came into play to make sure that the demands of harvesting were met.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  motion created a form of awkwardness and embarrassment, but not much more. Only Emile Vandervelde, emblematic figure of the socialist movement, and Georges Lorand, a liberal progressive politician, made a stand against the scandal that erupted in the CFS. The socialist deputy suggested to Paul de Favereau, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to intervene in order to shed light on the alleged atrocities. This proposal, however, was rejected on the grounds that Belgium cannot intervene in the affairs of another sovereign State. The very few reactions to this British motion reflected the disengagement that Belgium felt towards the Congo question. L\u00e9opold II did not wish to see the Congolese question placed on the agenda of European governments. The King, in a state of denial about the atrocities, considered these allegations as lies to serve a campaign of covetousness of the CFS by the \u201ccorsaire\u201d Morel, part of an attempt of the British to get their hands on the Congo Free State. The King then launched his own counter-propaganda. One of his first initiatives was to encourage the creation of the FEDIBE (La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration pour la Defense des Inter\u00eats Belges \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tranger) and that of its official organ, La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur le Congo. The drafting of these texts were naturally provided by the Congolese administration. Blamed for mistreatment towards the Congolese people, the King planned another initiative: the enactment of a law in October 1903 limiting the mandatory services of the indigenous people to around forty hours of work per month. Finally, the CFS answered the British motion in contemptuous terms suggesting that it was a plot organized by the merchants of Liverpool. The Congolese government did not suspect at this stage that Casement was authorized in September 1902 to make a journey to the Upper Congo. Early in 1903, Casement already gave a report on the inequalities of the system in place within the CFS. In May, he was appointed official investigator, and the Foreign Office, aware of the parliamentary debates on the Congo question, encouraged him to leave on his journey as soon as possible. On June 5, the Consul left Matadi. He followed the river and passed through L\u00e9opoldville (Kinshasa) and Coquilhatville (Mbandaka), two major cities in the CFS, but he also abandoned his river path to penetrate deeper into the African country. He spent three weeks at Lake Matumba (la Ntomba) that is located in the Domaine de la Couronne, personal property of King L\u00e9opold II. He also stayed for five days in Bongandanga, the ABIR station, on the Lopori River. This last week was crucial to Casement, as he thought he had collected enough material for his report. On September 11, he began his journey back to the Lower Congo and left the African continent to return to Europe on November 7th to begin his report. II. Belgian Reactions to the Casement Report a.1903-1906: The Casement Report and its Responses 1.December 1903\u2014Mid-March 1904: The Casement Report The British consul finalized Casement\u2019s report in December 1903, and it was published in February of the following year. The first official reactions were dated two months prior to the publication of the report. They were full of worry, fear, and suspicion. Pending the publication of the report, L\u00e9opold II threatened to reorient his policy to be closer to Germany. The King desperately wanted his hands on the report, and he sent Sir Alfred Jones, his associate in maritime affairs and consul of the CFS in Liverpool, twice to the Foreign Office to get an exclusive copy of it. In this atmosphere of great suspicion about England\u2019s ulterior motives in this report, the Count of Lalaing, who was Belgian ambassador in London, tried his best to reassure the governmental spheres that the English posed no threat to the Congo. To that end, Lalaing repeated the words of Lord Lansdowne that Britain did not wish to own any part of the CFS. And, upon sending the Casement Report to Brussels, Lalaing shared a confidence qualifying the Report\u2019s tone as fairly moderate. Of course, great was the ambassador\u2019s disappointment when the British press blatantly attacked the Congo and presented it on its front page news as hell on earth. In spite of these setbacks, the Belgian ambassador continued to work towards some form of appeasement between the various parties. During a dinner at Buckingham, for instance, he had a discussion with the Duke of Argyll, Edward VII\u2019s brother-in-law, who ultimately listened attentively to his claims. However, the relationship between the two ruling houses had, according to Edward VII, deteriorated, and it was not part of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan to improve\n\nquestion: What was the response to persistent allegations of abuse and exploitation in the Congo Free State?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1113}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  it. The King had become, as his close collaborators reveal, rather bitter in his later years, and it had become impossible for him to bear any contradiction. King L\u00e9opold\u2019s response to the Casement Report was vindictive. He warned the signatory members that the response of the CFS to the Casement Report would shed light on these allegations and establish the very circumstances reported by the British consul. His personal conviction was that \u201cles attaques exag\u00e9r\u00e9es de M. Casement contre les agents Congolais\u201d justified the word \u201clibel\u201d used by the Belgian consul in Liverpool, Edouard S\u00e8ve. Reprimanded by Foreign Affairs, S\u00e8ve\u2019s attitude was illustrative of the zeal of certain diplomats who wanted to get noticed by the Royal Palace, diplomats such as Charles Sarol\u00e9a, who directly opposed Morel. By contrast, Sir Alfred Jones adopted a rather different attitude towards the problem and strongly recommended avoiding controversy in relation to the Casement Report. Jones nevertheless remained extremely active in the Congo question and hired a number of people who, under the safe umbrella of neutrality, started conducting a number of counter-investigations. One of these people is Lord Mountmorres, an Irish peer who officially worked for the London journal, The Globe. The Irishman sent a report to the Foreign Office that he later published in book form. In his conclusion, Mountmorres made a case in favor of the Congolese administration. The CFS, he argued, was governed humanely. The blame of these atrocities, he continued in his report, fell on the greedy concessionaries. The CFS did not bear, therefore, more responsibility than any other colonial regime. The Belgian press\u2014except for the socialists\u2014mirrored these official concerns. Except for Le Peuple, most press organizations were highly critical of the Casement Report. Most of their reports were filled with downright hostility. The papers emphasized the only positive point in the report: that of the very much-improved state of the infrastructure and the abolishment of the slave trade. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle stressed \u201cl\u2019\u00e9nergie montr\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s belges\u201d to improve what they called, one of the wildest regions in Africa. The rest of their reports discredited both the man himself and his report. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge saw the report as having \u201cun caract\u00e8re tendencieux,\u201d mainly because Casement\u2019s trip lasted two months only, instead of the six that were officially planned. For the liberal paper, L\u00e9opold II accomplished \u201cune \u0153uvre de civilisation et de progr\u00e8s \u00e0 laquelle nulle autre n\u2019est comparable dans l\u2019ordre colonial.\u201d Le Soir, in an article dating back to December 1903, stated that Casement\u2019s work just amounted to \u201cune campagne de d\u00e9nigrement vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019Etat ind\u00e9pendant.\u201d Casement\u2019s findings relating to cruelty and oppression were directly discredited by referring to the counter-investigation carried out in the immediate aftermath of the publication by Marquis Bosco, judge in the CFS. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, compared Casement\u2019s and Bosco\u2019s findings, arguing in favor of the latter. According to the paper, while the English accused the Europeans of cruelty on the Congolese, Bosco demonstrated that these alleged cases of mutilation dated back more than ten years and therefore could not be the responsibility of Europeans. The discourse around British covetousness of the Congo imbued the newspaper articles. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, spoke of \u201cparti pris dans les affaires du Congo.\u201d Le Peuple was the only newspaper of those we examined that had another perspective on the Casement Report. The socialist paper presented the findings as facts \u201cdont l\u2019horreur fait fr\u00e9mir\u201d and wrote of \u201ccaoutchouc rouge.\u201d Le Peuple showed its true opposition to the system in the CFS after the publication of the inquiry commission. Reactions to the Casement Report were diverse in 1903. Except for Le Peuple, which stood for equal chances for all, the rest of these reactions\u2014both official and popular\u2014were shown to be quite distrustful of the report, often deeming it an exaggeration or a ploy to reconvene the Berlin Conference and discuss the Congo case. Words like \u201cexaggeration,\u201d \u201csuspicion,\u201d \u201cmistrust,\u201d \u201cBritish covetousness\u201d and \u201chorror\u201d were used to decry what Casement witnessed in and\n\nquestion: What was the response to persistent allegations of abuse and exploitation in the Congo Free State?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The response was diverse and distrustful of the report, deeming it an exaggeration or a ploy to reconvene the Berlin Conference and discuss the Congo case.", "usage": 1080}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It definitely led to passionate reactions among the Belgians, some feeling outrage at what they saw as an attack, and others feeling consternation at the treatment of the native population whom, according to the Berlin Conference, the Europeans were supposed to protect. 2.Mid-March 1904\u2014March 1905: Congo Free State Response The CFS gave its official response to the Casement Report on March 12, 1904. The suggestion made by the Congo Free State to conduct a private investigation into Casement\u2019s allegations\u2014just as Joseph Chamberlain had promised for the Fiji Islands\u2014caught the attention of the Foreign Office. This response, and its idea to launch a private investigation, was well-received by the Foreign Office. Francis Villiers, future British ambassador in Brussels, strongly recommended that this inquiry be led by an international commission. Bound by its statement, the Congo Free State sent three commissioners\u2014a Belgian, an Italian, and a Swiss\u2014to assess the situation in the country between October 1904 and February 1905. Neither Casement nor Morel believed in the efficiency of this commission, whose members were, in some form or other, connected to the King. The findings of the international commission were rather more nuanced than Casement\u2019s report. On the whole, it confirmed that atrocities were being committed on Congolese soil but presented the facts with their grey areas. They clearly established that the Epondo case was an exaggeration, a testimony that Casement failed to verify. The findings also suggested possible explanations for the type of behavior exhibited in the Congo (for example, climate, lack of morals, abuse of power, pressure for results). In general, their findings could be considered as more rational and nuanced than those of the Casement Report. In this period immediately following the Congo Free State response, each paper kept the stance that they had established towards the Casement Report. The Catholic and Liberal press emphasized the arguments that offered a more favorable vision of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. Both Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge published the report and were hoping that the response by the CFS would clear up \u201cun malentendu\u201d created by \u201cdes \u00e9l\u00e9ments anglais.\u201d Commenting upon the atrocities, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge wrote that these, which were at first considered as \u201cincontestables,\u201d had now been shown to be refutable. The paper illustrated its claims by means of two examples. First it discussed at length the well-known Epondo case, once the symbol of the oppression of the system and now simply the victim of a hunting accident. And second, in a later article, the paper discussed another mistake made by Casement. Casement had seen a dozen Congolese men travelling in a train carriage from L\u00e9opoldville to Matadi. They were tied up and controlled under the watchful eye of a soldier, leading the consul to believe they were involved in the rubber scandal. In point of fact, these people were a group of men condemned by the Court in Basoko who had come to Matadi to serve their sentence. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge confirmed its full support to the regime in the CFS and expressed its strong disagreement with the idea that the Congo administration led to \u201cun r\u00e9gime syst\u00e9matique de cruaut\u00e9s ou d\u2019oppression.\u201d The paper, nevertheless, acknowledged that some wrongdoings happened in the country, just as they had in any other colony. But then the paper immediately suggested a number of possible suggestions for these acts of cruelty. It argued that when such deeds had been committed, the perpetrators had been severely punished. It then advised its readers to bear in mind the difficulties Belgians had to face in the heart of Africa, a country with more than two hundred languages and where roads had yet to be built. According to L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, the English should have thought \u201caux difficult\u00e9s qui assaillent les officiers au Congo.\u201d It would be easy to condemn, wrote the paper, when \u201con est assis chez soi \u00e0 l\u2019abri du besoin.\u201d The English, therefore, should give some thought \u201c\u00e0 la mentalit\u00e9 de ces hommes bris\u00e9s de corps et d\u2019esprit dans une lutte perp\u00e9tuelle.\u201d Le Soir wrote a number of articles that defended the country against the Casement Report. In its issue of June 30, 1904, the newspaper interviewed Paul Landbeck, an official working in the CFS. Landbeck strongly contested all the allegations of the British consul against the Free State. His view was that the series of atrocities outlined by Casement were carried out fifteen or twenty years ago before the government stepped in to establish law and order. He put the responsibility\n\nquestion: What was the response to persistent allegations of abuse and exploitation in the Congo Free State?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Congo Free State suggested a private investigation and sent three commissioners to assess the situation.

He believed it \u201cimpossible\u201d that the hands were cut off by Europeans. Landbeck further argued that ill-treatment of the natives was severely punished in the CFS, and that there was no exploitation of the natives to collect rubber. There reigns in the Congo, according to the interviewee, \u201cun ordre parfait.\u201d His view was that \u201cl\u2019Etat remplit sa mission.\u201d The Belgian press continued to establish links between the Casement Report and English covetousness of the Congo. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge believed that the English started their anti-Congo campaigns at the time when the Free State was becoming an extremely prosperous state. The paper held the view that the English blamed the atrocities on the Congo administration with an ulterior motive, that of getting their hands on the Free State: A partir de 1895, le commerce de l\u2019Etat du Congo prend un essor marqu\u00e9, et le chiffre des exportations monte progressivement de 10 millions en 1895 \u00e0 50 millions en 1902. C\u2019est aussi \u00e0 partir d\u2019alors que le mouvement contre l\u2019Etat du Congo se dessine. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que l\u2019Etat affirmera davantage sa vitalit\u00e9 et ses progr\u00e8s, la campagne ira en s\u2019accentuant, s\u2019appuyant sur quelques cas particuliers et isol\u00e9s pour invoquer des pr\u00e9textes d\u2019humanit\u00e9 et dissimuler le v\u00e9ritable objectif des convoitises qui, dans leur impatience, se sont cependant trahies sous la plume des pamphl\u00e9taires et par la voix de membres de la Chambre des communes, mettant nettement en avant la disparition et le partage de l\u2019Etat du Congo. Le Peuple, however, faithful to its belief in a better treatment for all, continued to fight to expose the atrocities. It disagreed with the response by the Congo Free State and sided with Casement and English views on the issue. In June 1904, Le Peuple, to show its support to Casement, quoted at length three other sources in Sir Charles Dilke, English liberal politician, Sir John Garot, and Count Earl Percy, the British Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Dilke claimed that the Congo Free State was \u201cun enfer sur terre.\u201d Sir John Garot followed suit and argued that the country was \u201cune immense cuve dans laquelle fermentent les atrocit\u00e9s, les oppressions et les cruaut\u00e9s.\u201d The positions established in 1903-1904 continued in the same line of thought. Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle supported the response by the Congo Free State, relieving Belgium from blame in these allegations. The argument of British covetousness gathered momentum as the anti-Congo campaigns continued. Emile Vandervelde and Le Peuple, on the other hand, siding with the Casement Report, were still fighting for the defense of the native population in the Free State. Their campaign to expose the atrocities in the Congo Free State took its full measure in the next phase, in the response to the report of the inquiry commission. 3.March 1905 - November 1905: The Commission Report The inquiry commission came back in March 1905 from the Free State and its report was published in November 1905. Because it was published in the Bulletin Officiel, the official journal of the Congo Free State, this report was not accessible to the masses, but rather to a small minority of learned and interested people invested in the Congo question. In addition to the report\u2019s relative lack of visibility, the celebrations for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Belgian independence stirred up dormant patriotic feelings in Belgium. The two major political parties\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014touted the King\u2019s genius. The politicians were aware that an impressive program of embellishment and aggrandizement of Belgium had been made possible thanks to the Congo. The socialist leader, again bravely challenged the government about the atrocities against the native population but, just like in 1903, his concerns fell on deaf ears. The Congo question was compared by Lorand to the Dreyfus case in France. It had become impossible, according to the Liberal deputy, to treat the Congo question without being accused of treason towards Belgium or of collusion with the merchants of Liverpool. It was therefore of no surprise that these\n\nquestion: What was the response to persistent allegations of abuse and exploitation in the Congo Free State?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1069}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

One newspaper, however, stood out. Le Peuple showed the full measure of its opposition to the Congo system. While Vandervelde\u2019s voice was not heard in the parliamentary debates, he expressed his views in his socialist newspaper. The socialist leader and his newspaper summarized and quoted the Casement Report in the hope of exposing the cruel system of oppression. They called for a \u201ccampagne de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de piti\u00e9.\u201d The paper focused largely on Abir. The argument against the atrocities was all the more striking since Casement\u2019s findings relating to those concessionaries like Abir were confirmed in the commission report. Le Peuple made a point at presenting in detail the atrocities inflicted on the population to collect the rubber. Le Peuple printed the testimony of victims who came to testify in front of the international commission. They heard the stories of families being taken hostage by Abir because the men did not fill their quota of rubber; they were told about the armed sentries threatening the rubber carriers; they heard the stories of horrific corporal punishment, including floggings and lashes with a chicotte against those that did not fulfill their quotas. The paper described \u201cles civilisateurs Congolais\u201d as follows: On tuait sans distinction les femmes inoffensives et les enfants  Tout cela apparemment pour frapper de terreur ce malheureux peuple et le forcer \u00e0 apporter du caoutchouc  Les t\u00e9moins racont\u00e8rent qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient constamment battus avec la chicotte et que leurs femmes et leurs enfants \u00e9taient continuellement emprisonn\u00e9s, beaucoup de gens mourant soit en prison, soit imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9s. Pendant que les hommes dans la for\u00eat r\u00e9coltaient le caoutchouc, leurs femmes \u00e9taient outrag\u00e9es, maltrait\u00e9es ou enlev\u00e9es par les sentinelles  L\u2019histoire de l\u2019ABIR dans ces r\u00e9gions-ci est une histoire d\u2019oppression, de sang vers\u00e9 et d\u2019iniquit\u00e9. Il lui sera bien difficile d\u2019expier ses torts envers la population. This work of vulgarization and spreading of the Casement Report continued until 1906 when two major works vulgarized the commission report and thereby made it available to a much wider audience. The first of these major works was by liberal F\u00e9licien Cattier, Professor at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles; the other was by Father Vermeersch, a Jesuit. Interestingly, the vulgarization of the report came from two political strands\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014that were at the time staunch supporters of the Congo Free State. Father Vermeersch\u2019s book introduced catholic opinion to the possibility that the anti-Congo campaigns were not simply an attack against the Free State by Protestant missionaries. The annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium soon became a most viable solution. The proposal of annexation was taken so seriously that, led by Vandervelde, the debates were reopened on the Congo question in February 1906. Cattier\u2019s book and the commission report became the touchstones to start reforming the regime of the Congo Free State. During the discussion on the annexation of the Congo, references to Casement were rare, just as were those to Morel. A few days before the annexation in October 1908, Vandervelde once again emphasized the importance of the consul in this thorny issue. b.1910-1914: The Casement Report and the Putumayo Atrocities After his report on the CFS, Casement served as consul in various parts of the world, including Lisbon, the Brazilian port of Santos, followed by S\u00e3o Paulo, at the mouth of the Amazon. In July 1910, Edward Grey insisted that Casement be attached to a commission going to investigate reports of atrocities on the Putumayo River of the upper Amazon. What Casement found there was another oppressive regime. Agents of this regime, reported Casement, administrated inhumane treatment on the native population. Back in Britain, in January 1911, Casement submitted his detailed and damning report to the Foreign Secretary. The British government decided in July 1912 to publish Casement\u2019s report. It was subsequently published in the Belgian\n\nquestion: What was the response to persistent allegations of abuse and exploitation in the Congo Free State?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Opposition to the Congo system, calls for a \"campagne de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de piti\u00e9,\" and the introduction of the possibility of annexation were responses to persistent allegations of abuse and exploitation in the Congo Free State.", "usage": 1096}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Through the lens of the Putumayo Report, new light is shed on a number of interesting remarks on the Casement Report. When the Putumayo Report was commented on in Belgium in July 1912, the status of the CFS had evolved. The annexation of the Congo in 1908 as a colony of Belgium, known as the Belgian Congo, along with the King\u2019s death in 1909, had changed the situation completely. Belgium put L\u00e9opold II on a pedestal and the episode of the red rubber was erased from people\u2019s memory. A striking example of this change in perception is the case of Emile Vandervelde: the man who exposed and condemned the atrocities of the Congo during the Parliamentary debates and in heated and passionate articles in Le Peuple became, after his trip to the Congo, a fervent supporter of the colony. His policies now connected socialism and colonialism by arguing that both these movements had the moral obligation of guardianship towards the less developed people. The socialist leader then distanced himself from Morel\u2019s campaign. From the Belgian perspective, however, the Putumayo Report fell at a bad time. In 1910-12, when the Congo Free State became the Belgian Congo, its new colonial administration reacted rather poorly to the allegations about the inability of the Belgians to rule the Congo. For the authorities of the newly-created Belgian Congo, England froze interference by pursuing its consular inquiries into the Congo. Through a fear either imagined or real, the Congo remained for the Belgian authorities a coveted colony. Important discussions were taking place between Lalaing and Grey regarding the recognition by the English of the annexation of the Congo Free State to Belgium. When Casement returned from Putumayo, Count Lalaing highlighted the similar attitude that London adopted towards the Congo Free State and the Peruvian government.  Upon publication of the Putumayo Report, the British press made allusions to the Congo case and stirred up ancient feuds between the two countries. The ambassador very much regretted that the press made \u201callusions aussi blessantes qu\u2019exag\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ancien r\u00e9gime Congolais.\u201d  If The Times mentioned that the situation was worse in Peru, Morel insisted in The Economist that nothing could be compared to the CFS. The annexation was finally recognized the following year, and Grey\u2019s speech on that occasion was welcomed by L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the clearing of reckless attacks. In contrast, the Belgian government deemed that England was much too slow in her recognition of the Belgian Congo. If Lalaing highlighted similar reactions on the part of London towards both of Casement reports, the press adopted a totally different stance to Casement\u2019s Putumayo Report. There were no connections established in the papers about the fact that both reports were from the same pen. The press treated these two reports as totally distinct. Another striking difference was that, while the Casement Report was passionately debated and condemned as false (apart from a few) between 1903 and 1906, the Putumayo Report was presented in a detached manner, very matter-of-factly. The reports in Le Soir and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle took the form of factual lists of atrocities committed by the Peruvian Amazon Company on the indigenous population to collect rubber in all their excruciating details. The comparison of the treatment established two important facts: the first one was that there was indeed a complete amnesia in Belgium about the Congo atrocities. Not one reference was made to Casement, the damned and criticized author of the report on the CFS. And secondly, the difference in treatments highlighted the fact that, between 1903 and 1906, there was a passionate debate about the Congo question. The Casement Report, contrary to what Jules Marchal argues, did trigger interest and passionate debate among the Belgian population. c.1914-1918: The Casement Report and the Great War At the time of the outbreak of the Great War, Casement was retired. This retirement, however, was rather short lived. He turned his interest to Ireland\u2019s political turmoil. In 1914 Ireland, different political factions opposed each other on the issue of Home Rule, which would grant a Dublin government for the whole of Ireland. Unionists opposed the bill because they feared a loss of power; constitutional nationalists and John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, supported the Home Rule bill. To put actions into words, he urged Irishmen to enlist in the British army. Within the nationalists, there was a more radical Republican wing that included well-known names such as Patrick Pearse, Thomas Clarke, Sean McDermott, and\u2026Roger Casement. The former British consul had decided to fight alongside the republicans in the hope of the birth of an independent Ireland, free and not part of any Empire. Casement sought to obtain German support for a rebellion against English rule\u2014the Easter Rising. Shortly before\n\nquestion: What was the response to persistent allegations of abuse and exploitation in the Congo Free State?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The status of the CFS had evolved with the annexation of the Congo in 1908, leading to a shift in perception and a lack of response to the allegations.", "usage": 1148}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was convicted and executed for treason. Casement\u2019s involvement in these republican activities ultimately had a profound effect on the perspective of the Casement Report within Belgium. There were very few official responses to Casement\u2019s fate. Casement\u2019s involvement in the Easter Rising and his subsequent arrest were barely mentioned by the Belgian embassy in London. The Belgian Congo\u2019s mother country was deemed at this time \u201cpoor little Belgium,\u201d a country that the British needed to rescue after the German invasion of its territory. Despite the laudatory speeches and gestures of support, King Albert and the Belgian government were deeply concerned by the German occupation of Belgium and by the possible damage to the integrity of the national territory both of Belgium and of the Belgian Congo after the conflict. In this time of great crisis for Belgium, Casement\u2019s trial was not an object of interest for Belgian officials. Instead of going back to ancient feuds, the ambassador, Paul Hymans, worked towards the organization of two Anglo-Belgian events that would demonstrate the intimate friendship between the two countries. Success was complete, and Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, in his speeches, glorified the Belgian attitude. By coincidence, the two events took place shortly before and after Casement\u2019s execution on August 3, 1916. Then, too, the execution of the former consul was not exploited by Belgian officials. Hymans\u2019 personality played a big role in that fact. Following the publication of Morel\u2019s Truth and the War at the end of August, part of the public opinion\u2014including British\u2014was struck by the coincidence between Morel\u2019s statements in 1911, in which he advocated for an Anglo-German rapprochement on the basis of the sharing of the Congo, and the revelations at Casement\u2019s trial. From there emerged the idea that Morel and Casement were agents in the service of Germany, whose aim it was to create tensions between Belgium and Great Britain on the Congo question. This development, however, was rejected by the ambassador, who trusted history to decide on the issue. However, three important elements reversed the situation completely: first, the creation of a propaganda division at the ministry of the colonies in 1916; second, Morel\u2019s condemnation in 1917; and third, the need to look victimized at the peace conference. Now Minister of Foreign affairs, Hymans signed a note for the diplomats, prepared by Octave Louwers. If Louwers, as a young magistrate in the Congo Free State, denounced L\u00e9opold II as a scoundrel, the minister\u2019s adviser suggested not to be intimidated by the memory of the \u201catrocities,\u201d because if L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime had not been faultless, its benefits were too long overshadowed by the accusations orchestrated by questionable characters. Sir Herbert Samuel, author of the motion in May 1903, bowed a quarter of a century later in front of the Belgian work that was now at the forefront of progressive and enlightened colonial administrations. The myth that Morel and Casement were agents of Germany resurged throughout the whole period of the Belgian Congo. While there were very few references to Casement\u2019s fate in the official spheres, the press, on the other hand, turned the Casement\u2019s trial and his hanging into its main headlines. Casement was, in the Belgian press, a \u201ctra\u00eetre.\u201d Le Soir, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge reported Casement\u2019s arrest in every detail, branding him as \u201cIrlando-Boche,\u201d \u201cun agent de l\u2019Allemagne\u201d, and \u201cinventeur et le colporteur de l\u2019abominable l\u00e9gende des \u2018mains coup\u00e9es\u2019.\u201d With an ironic twist, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle asked \u201co\u00f9 sont ces belles d\u00e9clamations sur les atrocit\u00e9s congolaise, sur le \u2018caoutchouc rouge,\u2019 les vibrantes tirades humanitaires?\u201d The journalist compared Casement to a character in a Charles Dickens novel: Il y a dans un roman de Dickens une brave dame qui passe son temps \u00e0 s\u2019occuper des indig\u00e8nes de Borrisbola-Ghaa sur la c\u00f4te d\u2019Afrique\u2014mais qui oublie totalement l\u2019existence de son mari et de ses enfants. Le sieur Casement rappelle cette bonne femme, avec l\u2019infamie en plus. Casement\u2019s friendship with Germany was outlined in every article. Le Soir told Casement\u2019s story from the\n\nquestion: What was the response to persistent allegations of abuse and exploitation in the Congo Free State?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Belgian government did not directly respond the allegations, mainly because they were preoccupied with the German invasion of Belgium and had other national concerns.

The latter was in favor of Casement\u2019s suggestion to build an army from Irish prisoners of war to fight for the Irish cause. Casement\u2019s treason threw into doubt all the allegations that he made in 1903 on the Belgian administration of the CFS. In light of these events, the Casement Report was completely nullified by the Belgian society of the Great War. Casement\u2019s alignment with Germany was, to the papers, further proof that this man was not to be trusted and that his report was just a pack of lies. In Le Soir, for instance, dating back to April 1916, Casement\u2019s report was fully discredited: \u201cLa plupart des horribles \u00e9pisodes racont\u00e9s par cet \u00e9trange consul \u00e9taient exag\u00e9r\u00e9s et en partie invent\u00e9s  Il \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 ma\u00eetre dans l\u2019art de truquer les photographies et de falsifier les documents.\u201d British attitudes completely changed with regards to the Casement Report. The British that had proclaimed for all the world to hear the atrocities that were taking place in the Belgian Congo now apologized for being \u201cduped\u201d by the traitor Casement. Le Soir reported that the British press expressed \u201cun vif regret d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 entrain\u00e9e par ce tra\u00eetre.\u201d Casement\u2019s report was now being perceived a tool to create a gap between Belgium and England for the benefit of Germany. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle wrote passionately about this particular issue: Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de brouiller la Belgique et l\u2019Angleterre, et, par surcroit la France et l\u2019Angleterre? Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats politiques de l\u2019Allemagne, int\u00e9r\u00eats continentaux et int\u00e9r\u00eats coloniaux compris? Il est grand temps que la r\u00e9putation de la Belgique \u2018calomni\u00e9e\u2019 dans cette affaire, soit enfin r\u00e9habilit\u00e9e. In the light of these events, Belgian papers presented the Belgian Congo colony as being coveted by Germany. Le Soir, for one, wrote that \u201cMorel et Casement  travaillaient \u00e0 d\u00e9pouiller la Belgique de sa colonie, au profit de l\u2019Allemagne.\u201d All in all Casement\u2019s treason was, for Belgium and the Belgian Congo, holy bread. L\u00e9opold II and his humanitarian work in the Congo was now restored to good faith. L\u00e9opold II got his revenge, and the Belgian Congo, former Congo Free State, was reestablished among the model colonies in Africa. L\u00e9opold\u2019s \u0153uvre was \u201cveng\u00e9e des accusations du tra\u00eetre Casement,\u201d  wrote Le Soir. For those living in 1905 and 1906, when L\u00e9opold II was \u201cl\u2019objet d\u2019inf\u00e2mes outrages dans la presse \u00e9trang\u00e8re,\u201d these revelations were \u201cune \u00e9clatante revanche et une grande consolation.\u201d \u201cQuelle revanche,\u201d wrote Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, \u201cpour L\u00e9opold II et nos h\u00e9ros africains que les campagnes des complices de la barbarie allemande avaient r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire passer, m\u00eame aux yeux de certains de leurs compatriotes, pour de monstrueux criminels.\u201d III. Conclusion Roger Casement\u2019s report and the end of the CFS are considered today to be intrinsically connected to one another, the former leading to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo. This connection, however, as this paper hopes to have shown, is much more in the realm of myth than it is of actual historical reality. The direct link that exists in popular imagination between the report and the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo is a simplification of the role and impact of Casement\u2019s denunciatory report. Casement\u2019s report is first and foremost the work of an emphatic man who wished to denounce the suffering of the Congolese population. In Great Britain and the Anglophone world as a whole, the report had a great impact upon both the political and popular spheres of the country. Such an impact can be understood within the recurrent charges of maladministration that took place on L\u00e9opold\u2019s territory since 1895. Casement\u2019s report kindled the spark to this fire of\n\nquestion: What was the response to persistent allegations of abuse and exploitation in the Congo Free State?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Casement\u2019s report was fully discredited.", "usage": 1035}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In Belgium, however, the role and impact of the Casement Report was of a totally different nature. Political opinions oscillated between rejection of the report and support for its humanitarian concerns. Belgian socialists and liberals never hesitated in condemning the abuse taking place in the CFS, while the catholics cast a great shadow over the truth and veracity of Casement\u2019s statements. The use of a foreign report, however, was not acceptable within Belgian politics and an enquiry commission was established. The debate, therefore, was not on the basis of Casement\u2019s report, but rather on that of the enquiry commission. The Casement Report was but a piece in the domino effect that led to the annexation of the Congo to Belgium. Even after the annexation, the relentless attack upon L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo awakened Belgium\u2019s national pride. As a reaction there was a phenomenon of collective amnesia concerning the abuse, and L\u00e9opold II was put on a pedestal. The outbreak of the First World War resuscitated the figure of Roger Casement in yet another perspective. The Great War was a time of propaganda where partial truths are turned into patriotic dogmas. With the growing feeling of Belgian national pride, the country framed itself sympathetically with the hanging of Roger Casement by the British authorities for treason. The papers once again insisted on Casement\u2019s report as a pack of lies intended to steal the Congo away from Belgium. Today still, former Belgian colonials look upon Casement\u2019s report as exaggerated and his campaign as mainly anti-Belgian. In the end, the anti-Congo campaign created a dualistic representation of the CFS, one that has been taken up in literature by Adam Hochschild and Mario Vargas Llosa, both of whom represent Casement as the martyr of the humanitarian cause. This image of Casement as a martyr cannot be applied to Roger Casement, who was, and will always remain, a privileged witness of L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo.

As the State asserted more and more its vitality and progress, the campaign will keep on growing, relying on some specific and isolated cases to invoke humanity as a pretext to conceal the true objective of their envy.

This report was instrumental in Leopold finally relinquishing his private holdings in Africa. Leopold had held ownership of the Congolese state since 1885, granted to him by the Berlin Conference, in which he exploited its natural resources (mostly rubber) for his own private wealth. Through intercepted letters, Captain Hubert-Joseph Lothaire, the commander of the Congo Free State forces in the Ituri-campaign, learned that Charles Stokes (born in Dublin) was on his way from German East Africa to sell weapons to the Zanzibari slavers in the eastern Congo region. Stokes was arrested and taken to Captain Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a Drumhead court-martial. Stokes was found guilty of selling guns, gunpowder and detonators to the Congo Free State's Afro-Arab enemies. On 14 January 1895 he was sentenced to death and was hanged the next day (hoisted on a tree). To Lothaire, Charles Stokes was no more than a criminal whose hanging was fully justified. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister at the time, commented that if Stokes was in league with Arab slave-trading, then 'he deserved hanging'. Sir John Kirk, for years the British Consul in Zanzibar, remarked that \"he was no loss to us, although he was an honest man.\" The news of Stokes' execution was received with indifference by the British Foreign Office. When the German ambassador asked Sir Thomas H. Sanderson, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether the British government planned to take any steps regarding the execution of this \"well-known character\", Sanderson wrote: \"I do not quite understand why the Germans are pressing us.\" In August 1895, the attention of the British press was drawn to this case by Lionel Decle, a journalist for the Pall Mall Gazette. The press began to report on these events in great detail, The Daily News emphasized 'bloodthirsty precipitation', The Times a 'painful and disgraceful death', The Liverpool Daily Post 'horrified amazement through the British race', The Daily Telegraph 'death like a dog', adding, \"Have we all been wrong in believing that the most audacious foreigner \u2013 not to speak of any savage chief \u2013 would think once, twice and even trice, before he laid hands on a subject of Queen Victoria?\". As a result, the case became an international incident, better known as the Stokes Affair. Together, Britain and Germany pressured the Congo Free State to put Lothaire on trial, which they eventually did, a first trial was held in the city of Boma. The Free State paid compensation to the British (150,000 francs) and Germans (100,000 francs) and made it impossible by decree to impose martial law or death sentences on European citizens. Stokes's body was returned to his family. Lothaire was acquitted twice, first in April 1896 by a tribunal in Boma. In August 1896, the appeal was confirmed in Brussels by the Supreme Court of Congo, paving the way for the rehabilitation of Lothaire. The Stokes Affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State. It also damaged the reputation of King Leopold II of Belgium as a benevolent despot, which he had cultivated with so much effort. The case helped encourage the foundation of the Congo Reform Association \u2013 by Roger Casement and E. D. Morel \u2013 which in its turn put pressure on the Belgian government, which helped lead to the annexation of the Congo Free State by the Belgian state in 1908. For many years prior to the Casement Report there were reports from the Congo alleging widespread abuses and exploitation of the native population. In 1895, the situation was reported to Dr Henry Grattan Guinness (1861\u20131915), a missionary doctor. He had established the Congo-Balolo Mission in 1889, and was promised action by King Leopold later in 1895, but nothing changed. H. R. Fox-Bourne of the Aborigines' Protection Society had published Civilisation in Congoland in 1903, and the journalist E. D. Morel also wrote several articles about the Leopoldian government's behaviour in the Congo Free State. On 20 May 1903 a motion by the Liberal Herbert Samuel was debated in the British House of Commons, resulting in this resolution:... That the Government of the Congo Free State having, at its inception, guaranteed to the Powers that its Native subjects should be governed with humanity, and that no trading monopoly or privilege should be permitted within its dominions, this House requests His Majesty's Government to confer with the other Powers, signatories of the Berlin General Act by virtue of which the Congo\n\nquestion: What did the report confirm?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "abuses in the Congo Free State", "usage": 1140}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

His report was published in 1904, confirmed Morel's accusations, and had a considerable impact on public opinion.

The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. While the Report was issued as a Command paper in 1904, and was laid before the Houses of Parliament, the original was not published in full until 1985, in an annotated book by two Belgian professors of the history of colonialism. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist political leader and statesman Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold II to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives). Despite these findings, Leopold managed to retain personal control of the Congo until 1908, when the Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration as the Belgian Congo.

The report publicly denounced the atrocious systems of the rubber terror which forced Africans to extract the rubber from lianas to the profit of the State or concessionaries. Published in Great Britain in 1904, the report caused great outrage. The impact of the report in Belgium, however, has been so far underexplored. William Roger Louis mentions the importance of this report to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime and to Belgium\u2019s takeover of the Congo. This position, however, is contested by Jules Marchal, who has stated in his work that \u201cthe king had not to fear a reaction from the Belgian public who showed little interest in the Congo.\u201d None of these studies, however, have looked in depth at the impact of the publication of the Casement Report on the official reactions and on popular opinion in Belgium. This paper seeks to do just that. Keywords Roger Casement, King L\u00e9opold II, Congo Free State, Casement Report, Belgian Congo, Belgium, Commission of Inquiry, anti-Congo campaigns Introduction In July 1903, Roger Casement, as part of his duties as British consul, set out on a journey to the rubber regions of the Congo Free State (henceforth \u201cCFS\u201d). In February 1904, the publication of his report on the harsh living conditions of the indigenous population aroused much indignation within official and popular spheres in Great Britain. Very quickly, Casement and Edmund Morel founded the Congo Reform Association (henceforth \u201cC.R.A\u201d) and proclaimed their goal of putting an end to King L\u00e9opold II\u2019s Congo. And thus started one of the first humanitarian campaigns, one which, in spite of the end of the Congo Free State and its annexation to Belgium in 1908, continued its efforts until 1913. In the wake of the publication of the report in Great Britain, two very different courses of action were put in place. The first was official: the governmental spheres aimed at keeping the balance among European nations and expressing courtesy towards allied countries. The second course of action concerned public opinion: the C.R.A stepped up their propaganda against the CFS in order to stir the hearts of the British people into action. The role of the Casement Report was very different in each case. Officially, Great Britain used it in the hopes of reopening the Congo question with the signatories of the Berlin Conference. For the British people, the Report was certainly the trigger for the creation of the C.R.A but was also quickly replaced both by testimonies, primarily of Protestant missionaries, and by Morel\u2019s multiple books and pamphlets on the ill-treatment of the indigenous population. If studies on Casement\u2019s life and actions are manifold, the analysis of the reception of Casement\u2019s report and its impact in Belgium are important and, yet, relatively neglected research areas. In addition, the passing remarks on the subject are largely contradictory. William Roger Louis argues that the report was a major factor in the end of the CFS: \u201cCasement\u2019s report and his establishment of the C.R.A.,\u201d writes Louis, \u201cwere two feats that contributed greatly to the eventual downfall of the Leopoldian system, and the annexation of the Congo by Belgium.\u201d Jules Marchal, however, expresses the opinion that, because the Belgian population showed \u201clittle interest in the Congo,\u201d its impact was de-facto insignificant. In his contribution, he nevertheless recognizes that the real impact of the Casement Report and its role in the end of the CFS can only be really understood and evaluated by looking at the official and popular spheres within Belgium itself. It is true that the Congolese question was, first and foremost, an issue within Belgian domestic political affairs. Since 1890, Belgium was heir to L\u00e9opold II; and, since 1901, the Belgian Parliament could have started the annexation procedure of the Congo Free State to Belgium, had it wished to do so. Internationally, too, this right was never questioned either by England or by the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference. If the anti-Congo campaign led by the C.R.A. is still remembered elsewhere today, in Belgium itself, it had very little impact, and this is for two main reasons: first, while Casement and Morel\u2019s campaign was a pressurizing factor in Great Britain, it was much less so in Belgium. And second, in a very practical sense, the working language of the report was English, which was at that time not particularly well-known in Belgium. And yet, by criticizing the CFS, Casement and Morel were attacking the King, something that did not leave the\n\nquestion: What did the report confirm?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "the report confirmed the brutal treatment of the indigenous population in the Congo Free State", "usage": 1092}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since its independence in 1830, Belgium has had a constitutional monarchy. The country has a rather liberal constitution, affording many freedoms to its citizens. One of its articles guarantees the freedom of press and stipulates that censorship can never be established, thereby engendering a quasi-absolute freedom of the press. Belgian society at the time of L\u00e9opold II was organized into different segments, each with their own ideology. There were three pillars at that time: catholic, liberal, and socialist. Each pillar had its own social institutions, including distinct political parties and newspapers. For each of these pillars, the chosen mouthpiece was the press. Political parties and newspapers were so tied up together that it was not uncommon to find parliamentarians, party leaders, and ministers as writers or newspaper editors. For example, the leader of the socialist party, Emile Vandervelde, was one of the columnists for Le Peuple; and the leader of the catholic party, Charles Woeste, was the editor-in-chief of La Revue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Circulation was good, given that about 68% of the population was literate in 1900. For these reasons, we believe that the press is an excellent indicator of the popular opinions of each of the different pillars towards the Casement Report, the anti-Congo campaigns, and the annexation of Congo to Belgium. For this article, we have chosen Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle as the representative of the catholic pillar, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the liberal mouthpiece, and Le Peuple as the expression of the socialist viewpoint. We have also included in the corpus Le Soir which defines itself as a neutral paper. Those press publications subsidized by the CFS such as La Belgique coloniale, L\u2019Etoile belge, and Le Petit Bleu have not been included in this study because their influence was not great on Belgian popular opinion. The debate on the CFS is not limited to popular reactions, and therefore we also consider the official reactions. At the time of the debate Brussels was the capital of two distinct states: Belgium and the CFS, which were only linked together by the figure of King L\u00e9opold II. Thus we scrutinize and discuss at length the reactions of both the Belgian officials and the Congolese administration. The Casement Report as a whole can be read as a travelogue. Casement wrote down his experiences and the personal testimonies of the people he met on his journey. And contrary to popular belief, the Casement Report is not a passionate denunciation of the CFS but rather a well-balanced one. Casement was not, in other words, denouncing at all costs. As Louis explains, the report is \u201cnot a verbally scathing denunciation of the Congo administration,\u201d but rather, it is \u201cunderstated.\u201d Finesse and nuance characterize Casement\u2019s approach. He recognizes the benefits of the Belgian presence on Congolese soil\u2014for instance, in the field of infrastructure\u2014and shares his concerns about the treatment of the indigenous population. The consul was horrified at the drastic depopulation of some areas, which he interpreted either as the outbreak of sleeping sickness, frequent in an African context, or the result of heavy migration to the French Congo. Casement describes the forced labor at the different concessionaries, including Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anversoise and Anglo-Belgian India Rubber company (hencefore Abir), and gives a precise description of the tax system that enslaved the population. In that particular context, he tells the story of a teenage boy, Epondo, who was missing a left hand. The boy\u2019s explanation was that his hand was cut off by a sentry, a Congolese auxiliary employed by the concessionary. Casement personally investigated his case and sent the sentry before the authorities. Casement had, of course, no way of assessing the accuracy of Epondo\u2019s testimony, an issue that will be used against him in later stages. Nevertheless, the Report remains a mirror to the situation of the CFS in 1903. This paper looks at the role and impact of the Casement Report in Belgium. Its assessment within Belgium will help us to understand the part that it played in the end of the CFS and the development of the Belgian Congo. Ultimately, we wish to complicate the connection between Casement\u2019s report and the end of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo, which up to this point has been overly simplified. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part looks at those reactions immediately following the publication of the report, which range from outright hostility to passionate support for the humanitarian cause. This first part also looks at the official responses from the CFS and the inquiry commission set up by the King, which together constitute the official documents of the debate. Casement\u2019s report then comes back in 1912 when the consul wrote another damning condemnation on his\n\nquestion: What did the report confirm?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "the tax system that enslaved the population.", "usage": 1105}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Of particular interest are the widely differing reactions to it. The last part of the analysis looks at the reception of the Casement Report at the time of the First World War, a time of propaganda and mythical representations. At this time, Belgians had yet another take on the Casement Report. The anti-Congo campaigns were relentless at this point, pushing Belgian citizens to support the King and to deny the atrocities that had taken place. In addition Casement had been hanged for treason by the British. These two factors combined led to a complete disavowal of the Report. I. Edmund Morel\u2019s Campaign and the Casement Report (1903-1904) The name of Roger Casement and the anti-Congo campaigns are inextricably linked. While being a document among many others condemning King L\u00e9opold\u2019s kingdom, Casement\u2019s report remains a touchstone in anti-Congo campaigns. The intensity of the reactions to the report can only be understood by looking at the context of the creation of the CFS and what it stood for. In his burning ambitions of expanding abroad, L\u00e9opold II did not have the support of the financial and political elites of the country. The different parliamentary majorities saw in this expansion project the endangerment of Belgium\u2019s neutrality, and/or a real danger for Belgium\u2019s neutrality. For the liberals, the immediate priority was to keep good relations with neighboring countries, mainly for the development of the economy. In opposition, the socialists denounced the exploitation of the masses both in the industries and in the colonies. And Belgium\u2019s catholic government of the time, while it did not want to get involved in the Congo question, welcomed the idea of establishing catholic missions abroad. Faced with such opposition, L\u00e9opold II decided to act as an individual. In 1870, the King took up the argument of the civilizing mission. His reputation as a philanthropist had been consistently growing both in Belgium and abroad. The King\u2019s humanitarian interest found echo in the Anglophone world that was thoroughly involved with the abolitionist cause. In other words, the civilizing mission had truly become the leitmotiv of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. For this reason, among others, the CFS would be under the gaze of international public opinion. At the outset, L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan was to operate without imposing customs or import duties. While this option proved to be positive for the creation of the CFS, financially it was untenable\u2014so untenable, in fact, that the King was forced to invest his own finances into the CFS. Debts kept growing and, on the verge of bankruptcy, the King decided to drastically change the economic policy of the CFS. Gone were the days of barter with the local population. Emphasis was now on the harvesting of goods, more specifically rubber and ivory. But this new system also led to the use of violence: the military force now came into play to make sure that the demands of harvesting were met. And with the use of the military force came a plethora of violent acts and atrocities, including rape, murder, and mutilation. The atrocities linked to the rubber trade were then not a sought-out politic of L\u00e9opold II, but rather an indirect consequence of his economic position. In 1895, a campaign\u2014in The Times, among others\u2014denounced the abuse in the CFS. Hearing of these allegations, the Belgian King promised changes and reforms and, in that way, managed to keep the reputation of the CFS intact\u2014that is, until the arrival on the scene of Edmund Morel. Hired by Sir Alfred Jones, business partner of L\u00e9opold II, Morel used his pen to defend the cause of ship-owners in Liverpool. As a clerk for the company Morel noticed that the ships leaving Belgium for the Congo carried guns, chains, and explosives but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the CFS came back full of valuable products such as rubber and ivory. This discovery led him to understand the exploitative nature of the regime. To defend the welfare of Africans, Morel launched his own newspaper\u2014The West African Mail\u2014to denounce the brutal exploitation of the natives. This new publication immediately drew the attention of the CFS. The association of Jones and Morel later fuelled the Belgian fantasy that claimed the merchants of Liverpool were plotting against the country. Morel played an important role in the adoption\u2014by the House of Commons on May 20, 1903\u2014of a motion suggested by British Liberal M.P. Herbert Samuel on the Congo question. Samuel\u2019s motion, based on humanitarian and economic arguments, hoped to reconvene the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference\u2014including Belgium\u2014to discuss once again the Congolese question. In Belgium, the\n\nquestion: What did the report confirm?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "atrocities committed upon the Indians in the area", "usage": 1102}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  motion created a form of awkwardness and embarrassment, but not much more. Only Emile Vandervelde, emblematic figure of the socialist movement, and Georges Lorand, a liberal progressive politician, made a stand against the scandal that erupted in the CFS. The socialist deputy suggested to Paul de Favereau, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to intervene in order to shed light on the alleged atrocities. This proposal, however, was rejected on the grounds that Belgium cannot intervene in the affairs of another sovereign State. The very few reactions to this British motion reflected the disengagement that Belgium felt towards the Congo question. L\u00e9opold II did not wish to see the Congolese question placed on the agenda of European governments. The King, in a state of denial about the atrocities, considered these allegations as lies to serve a campaign of covetousness of the CFS by the \u201ccorsaire\u201d Morel, part of an attempt of the British to get their hands on the Congo Free State. The King then launched his own counter-propaganda. One of his first initiatives was to encourage the creation of the FEDIBE (La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration pour la Defense des Inter\u00eats Belges \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tranger) and that of its official organ, La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur le Congo. The drafting of these texts were naturally provided by the Congolese administration. Blamed for mistreatment towards the Congolese people, the King planned another initiative: the enactment of a law in October 1903 limiting the mandatory services of the indigenous people to around forty hours of work per month. Finally, the CFS answered the British motion in contemptuous terms suggesting that it was a plot organized by the merchants of Liverpool. The Congolese government did not suspect at this stage that Casement was authorized in September 1902 to make a journey to the Upper Congo. Early in 1903, Casement already gave a report on the inequalities of the system in place within the CFS. In May, he was appointed official investigator, and the Foreign Office, aware of the parliamentary debates on the Congo question, encouraged him to leave on his journey as soon as possible. On June 5, the Consul left Matadi. He followed the river and passed through L\u00e9opoldville (Kinshasa) and Coquilhatville (Mbandaka), two major cities in the CFS, but he also abandoned his river path to penetrate deeper into the African country. He spent three weeks at Lake Matumba (la Ntomba) that is located in the Domaine de la Couronne, personal property of King L\u00e9opold II. He also stayed for five days in Bongandanga, the ABIR station, on the Lopori River. This last week was crucial to Casement, as he thought he had collected enough material for his report. On September 11, he began his journey back to the Lower Congo and left the African continent to return to Europe on November 7th to begin his report. II. Belgian Reactions to the Casement Report a.1903-1906: The Casement Report and its Responses 1.December 1903\u2014Mid-March 1904: The Casement Report The British consul finalized Casement\u2019s report in December 1903, and it was published in February of the following year. The first official reactions were dated two months prior to the publication of the report. They were full of worry, fear, and suspicion. Pending the publication of the report, L\u00e9opold II threatened to reorient his policy to be closer to Germany. The King desperately wanted his hands on the report, and he sent Sir Alfred Jones, his associate in maritime affairs and consul of the CFS in Liverpool, twice to the Foreign Office to get an exclusive copy of it. In this atmosphere of great suspicion about England\u2019s ulterior motives in this report, the Count of Lalaing, who was Belgian ambassador in London, tried his best to reassure the governmental spheres that the English posed no threat to the Congo. To that end, Lalaing repeated the words of Lord Lansdowne that Britain did not wish to own any part of the CFS. And, upon sending the Casement Report to Brussels, Lalaing shared a confidence qualifying the Report\u2019s tone as fairly moderate. Of course, great was the ambassador\u2019s disappointment when the British press blatantly attacked the Congo and presented it on its front page news as hell on earth. In spite of these setbacks, the Belgian ambassador continued to work towards some form of appeasement between the various parties. During a dinner at Buckingham, for instance, he had a discussion with the Duke of Argyll, Edward VII\u2019s brother-in-law, who ultimately listened attentively to his claims. However, the relationship between the two ruling houses had, according to Edward VII, deteriorated, and it was not part of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan to improve\n\nquestion: What did the report confirm?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Casement's report confirmed the inequalities of the system in place within the Congo Free State.", "usage": 1118}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  it. The King had become, as his close collaborators reveal, rather bitter in his later years, and it had become impossible for him to bear any contradiction. King L\u00e9opold\u2019s response to the Casement Report was vindictive. He warned the signatory members that the response of the CFS to the Casement Report would shed light on these allegations and establish the very circumstances reported by the British consul. His personal conviction was that \u201cles attaques exag\u00e9r\u00e9es de M. Casement contre les agents Congolais\u201d justified the word \u201clibel\u201d used by the Belgian consul in Liverpool, Edouard S\u00e8ve. Reprimanded by Foreign Affairs, S\u00e8ve\u2019s attitude was illustrative of the zeal of certain diplomats who wanted to get noticed by the Royal Palace, diplomats such as Charles Sarol\u00e9a, who directly opposed Morel. By contrast, Sir Alfred Jones adopted a rather different attitude towards the problem and strongly recommended avoiding controversy in relation to the Casement Report. Jones nevertheless remained extremely active in the Congo question and hired a number of people who, under the safe umbrella of neutrality, started conducting a number of counter-investigations. One of these people is Lord Mountmorres, an Irish peer who officially worked for the London journal, The Globe. The Irishman sent a report to the Foreign Office that he later published in book form. In his conclusion, Mountmorres made a case in favor of the Congolese administration. The CFS, he argued, was governed humanely. The blame of these atrocities, he continued in his report, fell on the greedy concessionaries. The CFS did not bear, therefore, more responsibility than any other colonial regime. The Belgian press\u2014except for the socialists\u2014mirrored these official concerns. Except for Le Peuple, most press organizations were highly critical of the Casement Report. Most of their reports were filled with downright hostility. The papers emphasized the only positive point in the report: that of the very much-improved state of the infrastructure and the abolishment of the slave trade. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle stressed \u201cl\u2019\u00e9nergie montr\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s belges\u201d to improve what they called, one of the wildest regions in Africa. The rest of their reports discredited both the man himself and his report. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge saw the report as having \u201cun caract\u00e8re tendencieux,\u201d mainly because Casement\u2019s trip lasted two months only, instead of the six that were officially planned. For the liberal paper, L\u00e9opold II accomplished \u201cune \u0153uvre de civilisation et de progr\u00e8s \u00e0 laquelle nulle autre n\u2019est comparable dans l\u2019ordre colonial.\u201d Le Soir, in an article dating back to December 1903, stated that Casement\u2019s work just amounted to \u201cune campagne de d\u00e9nigrement vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019Etat ind\u00e9pendant.\u201d Casement\u2019s findings relating to cruelty and oppression were directly discredited by referring to the counter-investigation carried out in the immediate aftermath of the publication by Marquis Bosco, judge in the CFS. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, compared Casement\u2019s and Bosco\u2019s findings, arguing in favor of the latter. According to the paper, while the English accused the Europeans of cruelty on the Congolese, Bosco demonstrated that these alleged cases of mutilation dated back more than ten years and therefore could not be the responsibility of Europeans. The discourse around British covetousness of the Congo imbued the newspaper articles. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, spoke of \u201cparti pris dans les affaires du Congo.\u201d Le Peuple was the only newspaper of those we examined that had another perspective on the Casement Report. The socialist paper presented the findings as facts \u201cdont l\u2019horreur fait fr\u00e9mir\u201d and wrote of \u201ccaoutchouc rouge.\u201d Le Peuple showed its true opposition to the system in the CFS after the publication of the inquiry commission. Reactions to the Casement Report were diverse in 1903. Except for Le Peuple, which stood for equal chances for all, the rest of these reactions\u2014both official and popular\u2014were shown to be quite distrustful of the report, often deeming it an exaggeration or a ploy to reconvene the Berlin Conference and discuss the Congo case. Words like \u201cexaggeration,\u201d \u201csuspicion,\u201d \u201cmistrust,\u201d \u201cBritish covetousness\u201d and \u201chorror\u201d were used to decry what Casement witnessed in and\n\nquestion: What did the report confirm?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Atrocities in the Congo Free State.", "usage": 1044}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It definitely led to passionate reactions among the Belgians, some feeling outrage at what they saw as an attack, and others feeling consternation at the treatment of the native population whom, according to the Berlin Conference, the Europeans were supposed to protect. 2.Mid-March 1904\u2014March 1905: Congo Free State Response The CFS gave its official response to the Casement Report on March 12, 1904. The suggestion made by the Congo Free State to conduct a private investigation into Casement\u2019s allegations\u2014just as Joseph Chamberlain had promised for the Fiji Islands\u2014caught the attention of the Foreign Office. This response, and its idea to launch a private investigation, was well-received by the Foreign Office. Francis Villiers, future British ambassador in Brussels, strongly recommended that this inquiry be led by an international commission. Bound by its statement, the Congo Free State sent three commissioners\u2014a Belgian, an Italian, and a Swiss\u2014to assess the situation in the country between October 1904 and February 1905. Neither Casement nor Morel believed in the efficiency of this commission, whose members were, in some form or other, connected to the King. The findings of the international commission were rather more nuanced than Casement\u2019s report. On the whole, it confirmed that atrocities were being committed on Congolese soil but presented the facts with their grey areas. They clearly established that the Epondo case was an exaggeration, a testimony that Casement failed to verify. The findings also suggested possible explanations for the type of behavior exhibited in the Congo (for example, climate, lack of morals, abuse of power, pressure for results). In general, their findings could be considered as more rational and nuanced than those of the Casement Report. In this period immediately following the Congo Free State response, each paper kept the stance that they had established towards the Casement Report. The Catholic and Liberal press emphasized the arguments that offered a more favorable vision of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. Both Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge published the report and were hoping that the response by the CFS would clear up \u201cun malentendu\u201d created by \u201cdes \u00e9l\u00e9ments anglais.\u201d Commenting upon the atrocities, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge wrote that these, which were at first considered as \u201cincontestables,\u201d had now been shown to be refutable. The paper illustrated its claims by means of two examples. First it discussed at length the well-known Epondo case, once the symbol of the oppression of the system and now simply the victim of a hunting accident. And second, in a later article, the paper discussed another mistake made by Casement. Casement had seen a dozen Congolese men travelling in a train carriage from L\u00e9opoldville to Matadi. They were tied up and controlled under the watchful eye of a soldier, leading the consul to believe they were involved in the rubber scandal. In point of fact, these people were a group of men condemned by the Court in Basoko who had come to Matadi to serve their sentence. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge confirmed its full support to the regime in the CFS and expressed its strong disagreement with the idea that the Congo administration led to \u201cun r\u00e9gime syst\u00e9matique de cruaut\u00e9s ou d\u2019oppression.\u201d The paper, nevertheless, acknowledged that some wrongdoings happened in the country, just as they had in any other colony. But then the paper immediately suggested a number of possible suggestions for these acts of cruelty. It argued that when such deeds had been committed, the perpetrators had been severely punished. It then advised its readers to bear in mind the difficulties Belgians had to face in the heart of Africa, a country with more than two hundred languages and where roads had yet to be built. According to L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, the English should have thought \u201caux difficult\u00e9s qui assaillent les officiers au Congo.\u201d It would be easy to condemn, wrote the paper, when \u201con est assis chez soi \u00e0 l\u2019abri du besoin.\u201d The English, therefore, should give some thought \u201c\u00e0 la mentalit\u00e9 de ces hommes bris\u00e9s de corps et d\u2019esprit dans une lutte perp\u00e9tuelle.\u201d Le Soir wrote a number of articles that defended the country against the Casement Report. In its issue of June 30, 1904, the newspaper interviewed Paul Landbeck, an official working in the CFS. Landbeck strongly contested all the allegations of the British consul against the Free State. His view was that the series of atrocities outlined by Casement were carried out fifteen or twenty years ago before the government stepped in to establish law and order. He put the responsibility\n\nquestion: What did the report confirm?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The report confirmed that atrocities were being committed on Congolese soil.", "usage": 1087}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He believed it \u201cimpossible\u201d that the hands were cut off by Europeans. Landbeck further argued that ill-treatment of the natives was severely punished in the CFS, and that there was no exploitation of the natives to collect rubber. There reigns in the Congo, according to the interviewee, \u201cun ordre parfait.\u201d His view was that \u201cl\u2019Etat remplit sa mission.\u201d The Belgian press continued to establish links between the Casement Report and English covetousness of the Congo. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge believed that the English started their anti-Congo campaigns at the time when the Free State was becoming an extremely prosperous state. The paper held the view that the English blamed the atrocities on the Congo administration with an ulterior motive, that of getting their hands on the Free State: A partir de 1895, le commerce de l\u2019Etat du Congo prend un essor marqu\u00e9, et le chiffre des exportations monte progressivement de 10 millions en 1895 \u00e0 50 millions en 1902. C\u2019est aussi \u00e0 partir d\u2019alors que le mouvement contre l\u2019Etat du Congo se dessine. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que l\u2019Etat affirmera davantage sa vitalit\u00e9 et ses progr\u00e8s, la campagne ira en s\u2019accentuant, s\u2019appuyant sur quelques cas particuliers et isol\u00e9s pour invoquer des pr\u00e9textes d\u2019humanit\u00e9 et dissimuler le v\u00e9ritable objectif des convoitises qui, dans leur impatience, se sont cependant trahies sous la plume des pamphl\u00e9taires et par la voix de membres de la Chambre des communes, mettant nettement en avant la disparition et le partage de l\u2019Etat du Congo. Le Peuple, however, faithful to its belief in a better treatment for all, continued to fight to expose the atrocities. It disagreed with the response by the Congo Free State and sided with Casement and English views on the issue. In June 1904, Le Peuple, to show its support to Casement, quoted at length three other sources in Sir Charles Dilke, English liberal politician, Sir John Garot, and Count Earl Percy, the British Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Dilke claimed that the Congo Free State was \u201cun enfer sur terre.\u201d Sir John Garot followed suit and argued that the country was \u201cune immense cuve dans laquelle fermentent les atrocit\u00e9s, les oppressions et les cruaut\u00e9s.\u201d The positions established in 1903-1904 continued in the same line of thought. Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle supported the response by the Congo Free State, relieving Belgium from blame in these allegations. The argument of British covetousness gathered momentum as the anti-Congo campaigns continued. Emile Vandervelde and Le Peuple, on the other hand, siding with the Casement Report, were still fighting for the defense of the native population in the Free State. Their campaign to expose the atrocities in the Congo Free State took its full measure in the next phase, in the response to the report of the inquiry commission. 3.March 1905 - November 1905: The Commission Report The inquiry commission came back in March 1905 from the Free State and its report was published in November 1905. Because it was published in the Bulletin Officiel, the official journal of the Congo Free State, this report was not accessible to the masses, but rather to a small minority of learned and interested people invested in the Congo question. In addition to the report\u2019s relative lack of visibility, the celebrations for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Belgian independence stirred up dormant patriotic feelings in Belgium. The two major political parties\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014touted the King\u2019s genius. The politicians were aware that an impressive program of embellishment and aggrandizement of Belgium had been made possible thanks to the Congo. The socialist leader, again bravely challenged the government about the atrocities against the native population but, just like in 1903, his concerns fell on deaf ears. The Congo question was compared by Lorand to the Dreyfus case in France. It had become impossible, according to the Liberal deputy, to treat the Congo question without being accused of treason towards Belgium or of collusion with the merchants of Liverpool. It was therefore of no surprise that these\n\nquestion: What did the report confirm?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The report confirmed hand-cutting atrocities by native soldiers and linked the English covetousness with the Congo Free State.", "usage": 1080}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle corroborated the commission report, and, in their respective newspapers, primarily printed those findings of the commission that could speak for themselves. One newspaper, however, stood out. Le Peuple showed the full measure of its opposition to the Congo system. While Vandervelde\u2019s voice was not heard in the parliamentary debates, he expressed his views in his socialist newspaper. The socialist leader and his newspaper summarized and quoted the Casement Report in the hope of exposing the cruel system of oppression. They called for a \u201ccampagne de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de piti\u00e9.\u201d The paper focused largely on Abir. The argument against the atrocities was all the more striking since Casement\u2019s findings relating to those concessionaries like Abir were confirmed in the commission report. Le Peuple made a point at presenting in detail the atrocities inflicted on the population to collect the rubber. Le Peuple printed the testimony of victims who came to testify in front of the international commission. They heard the stories of families being taken hostage by Abir because the men did not fill their quota of rubber; they were told about the armed sentries threatening the rubber carriers; they heard the stories of horrific corporal punishment, including floggings and lashes with a chicotte against those that did not fulfill their quotas. The paper described \u201cles civilisateurs Congolais\u201d as follows: On tuait sans distinction les femmes inoffensives et les enfants  Tout cela apparemment pour frapper de terreur ce malheureux peuple et le forcer \u00e0 apporter du caoutchouc  Les t\u00e9moins racont\u00e8rent qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient constamment battus avec la chicotte et que leurs femmes et leurs enfants \u00e9taient continuellement emprisonn\u00e9s, beaucoup de gens mourant soit en prison, soit imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9s. Pendant que les hommes dans la for\u00eat r\u00e9coltaient le caoutchouc, leurs femmes \u00e9taient outrag\u00e9es, maltrait\u00e9es ou enlev\u00e9es par les sentinelles  L\u2019histoire de l\u2019ABIR dans ces r\u00e9gions-ci est une histoire d\u2019oppression, de sang vers\u00e9 et d\u2019iniquit\u00e9. Il lui sera bien difficile d\u2019expier ses torts envers la population. This work of vulgarization and spreading of the Casement Report continued until 1906 when two major works vulgarized the commission report and thereby made it available to a much wider audience. The first of these major works was by liberal F\u00e9licien Cattier, Professor at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles; the other was by Father Vermeersch, a Jesuit. Interestingly, the vulgarization of the report came from two political strands\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014that were at the time staunch supporters of the Congo Free State. Father Vermeersch\u2019s book introduced catholic opinion to the possibility that the anti-Congo campaigns were not simply an attack against the Free State by Protestant missionaries. The annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium soon became a most viable solution. The proposal of annexation was taken so seriously that, led by Vandervelde, the debates were reopened on the Congo question in February 1906. Cattier\u2019s book and the commission report became the touchstones to start reforming the regime of the Congo Free State. During the discussion on the annexation of the Congo, references to Casement were rare, just as were those to Morel. A few days before the annexation in October 1908, Vandervelde once again emphasized the importance of the consul in this thorny issue. b.1910-1914: The Casement Report and the Putumayo Atrocities After his report on the CFS, Casement served as consul in various parts of the world, including Lisbon, the Brazilian port of Santos, followed by S\u00e3o Paulo, at the mouth of the Amazon. In July 1910, Edward Grey insisted that Casement be attached to a commission going to investigate reports of atrocities on the Putumayo River of the upper Amazon. What Casement found there was another oppressive regime. Agents of this regime, reported Casement, administrated inhumane treatment on the native population. Back in Britain, in January 1911, Casement submitted his detailed and damning report to the Foreign Secretary. The British government decided in July 1912 to publish Casement\u2019s report. It was subsequently published in the Belgian\n\nquestion: What did the report confirm?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The report confirmed that the Congo Free State had inflicted atrocities on the population to collect rubber, including horrific corporal punishment and mistreatment of women and children.", "usage": 1069}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Through the lens of the Putumayo Report, new light is shed on a number of interesting remarks on the Casement Report. When the Putumayo Report was commented on in Belgium in July 1912, the status of the CFS had evolved. The annexation of the Congo in 1908 as a colony of Belgium, known as the Belgian Congo, along with the King\u2019s death in 1909, had changed the situation completely. Belgium put L\u00e9opold II on a pedestal and the episode of the red rubber was erased from people\u2019s memory. A striking example of this change in perception is the case of Emile Vandervelde: the man who exposed and condemned the atrocities of the Congo during the Parliamentary debates and in heated and passionate articles in Le Peuple became, after his trip to the Congo, a fervent supporter of the colony. His policies now connected socialism and colonialism by arguing that both these movements had the moral obligation of guardianship towards the less developed people. The socialist leader then distanced himself from Morel\u2019s campaign. From the Belgian perspective, however, the Putumayo Report fell at a bad time. In 1910-12, when the Congo Free State became the Belgian Congo, its new colonial administration reacted rather poorly to the allegations about the inability of the Belgians to rule the Congo. For the authorities of the newly-created Belgian Congo, England froze interference by pursuing its consular inquiries into the Congo. Through a fear either imagined or real, the Congo remained for the Belgian authorities a coveted colony. Important discussions were taking place between Lalaing and Grey regarding the recognition by the English of the annexation of the Congo Free State to Belgium. When Casement returned from Putumayo, Count Lalaing highlighted the similar attitude that London adopted towards the Congo Free State and the Peruvian government.  Upon publication of the Putumayo Report, the British press made allusions to the Congo case and stirred up ancient feuds between the two countries. The ambassador very much regretted that the press made \u201callusions aussi blessantes qu\u2019exag\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ancien r\u00e9gime Congolais.\u201d  If The Times mentioned that the situation was worse in Peru, Morel insisted in The Economist that nothing could be compared to the CFS. The annexation was finally recognized the following year, and Grey\u2019s speech on that occasion was welcomed by L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the clearing of reckless attacks. In contrast, the Belgian government deemed that England was much too slow in her recognition of the Belgian Congo. If Lalaing highlighted similar reactions on the part of London towards both of Casement reports, the press adopted a totally different stance to Casement\u2019s Putumayo Report. There were no connections established in the papers about the fact that both reports were from the same pen. The press treated these two reports as totally distinct. Another striking difference was that, while the Casement Report was passionately debated and condemned as false (apart from a few) between 1903 and 1906, the Putumayo Report was presented in a detached manner, very matter-of-factly. The reports in Le Soir and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle took the form of factual lists of atrocities committed by the Peruvian Amazon Company on the indigenous population to collect rubber in all their excruciating details. The comparison of the treatment established two important facts: the first one was that there was indeed a complete amnesia in Belgium about the Congo atrocities. Not one reference was made to Casement, the damned and criticized author of the report on the CFS. And secondly, the difference in treatments highlighted the fact that, between 1903 and 1906, there was a passionate debate about the Congo question. The Casement Report, contrary to what Jules Marchal argues, did trigger interest and passionate debate among the Belgian population. c.1914-1918: The Casement Report and the Great War At the time of the outbreak of the Great War, Casement was retired. This retirement, however, was rather short lived. He turned his interest to Ireland\u2019s political turmoil. In 1914 Ireland, different political factions opposed each other on the issue of Home Rule, which would grant a Dublin government for the whole of Ireland. Unionists opposed the bill because they feared a loss of power; constitutional nationalists and John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, supported the Home Rule bill. To put actions into words, he urged Irishmen to enlist in the British army. Within the nationalists, there was a more radical Republican wing that included well-known names such as Patrick Pearse, Thomas Clarke, Sean McDermott, and\u2026Roger Casement. The former British consul had decided to fight alongside the republicans in the hope of the birth of an independent Ireland, free and not part of any Empire. Casement sought to obtain German support for a rebellion against English rule\u2014the Easter Rising. Shortly before\n\nquestion: What did the report confirm?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1104}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was convicted and executed for treason. Casement\u2019s involvement in these republican activities ultimately had a profound effect on the perspective of the Casement Report within Belgium. There were very few official responses to Casement\u2019s fate. Casement\u2019s involvement in the Easter Rising and his subsequent arrest were barely mentioned by the Belgian embassy in London. The Belgian Congo\u2019s mother country was deemed at this time \u201cpoor little Belgium,\u201d a country that the British needed to rescue after the German invasion of its territory. Despite the laudatory speeches and gestures of support, King Albert and the Belgian government were deeply concerned by the German occupation of Belgium and by the possible damage to the integrity of the national territory both of Belgium and of the Belgian Congo after the conflict. In this time of great crisis for Belgium, Casement\u2019s trial was not an object of interest for Belgian officials. Instead of going back to ancient feuds, the ambassador, Paul Hymans, worked towards the organization of two Anglo-Belgian events that would demonstrate the intimate friendship between the two countries. Success was complete, and Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, in his speeches, glorified the Belgian attitude. By coincidence, the two events took place shortly before and after Casement\u2019s execution on August 3, 1916. Then, too, the execution of the former consul was not exploited by Belgian officials. Hymans\u2019 personality played a big role in that fact. Following the publication of Morel\u2019s Truth and the War at the end of August, part of the public opinion\u2014including British\u2014was struck by the coincidence between Morel\u2019s statements in 1911, in which he advocated for an Anglo-German rapprochement on the basis of the sharing of the Congo, and the revelations at Casement\u2019s trial. From there emerged the idea that Morel and Casement were agents in the service of Germany, whose aim it was to create tensions between Belgium and Great Britain on the Congo question. This development, however, was rejected by the ambassador, who trusted history to decide on the issue. However, three important elements reversed the situation completely: first, the creation of a propaganda division at the ministry of the colonies in 1916; second, Morel\u2019s condemnation in 1917; and third, the need to look victimized at the peace conference. Now Minister of Foreign affairs, Hymans signed a note for the diplomats, prepared by Octave Louwers. If Louwers, as a young magistrate in the Congo Free State, denounced L\u00e9opold II as a scoundrel, the minister\u2019s adviser suggested not to be intimidated by the memory of the \u201catrocities,\u201d because if L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime had not been faultless, its benefits were too long overshadowed by the accusations orchestrated by questionable characters. Sir Herbert Samuel, author of the motion in May 1903, bowed a quarter of a century later in front of the Belgian work that was now at the forefront of progressive and enlightened colonial administrations. The myth that Morel and Casement were agents of Germany resurged throughout the whole period of the Belgian Congo. While there were very few references to Casement\u2019s fate in the official spheres, the press, on the other hand, turned the Casement\u2019s trial and his hanging into its main headlines. Casement was, in the Belgian press, a \u201ctra\u00eetre.\u201d Le Soir, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge reported Casement\u2019s arrest in every detail, branding him as \u201cIrlando-Boche,\u201d \u201cun agent de l\u2019Allemagne\u201d, and \u201cinventeur et le colporteur de l\u2019abominable l\u00e9gende des \u2018mains coup\u00e9es\u2019.\u201d With an ironic twist, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle asked \u201co\u00f9 sont ces belles d\u00e9clamations sur les atrocit\u00e9s congolaise, sur le \u2018caoutchouc rouge,\u2019 les vibrantes tirades humanitaires?\u201d The journalist compared Casement to a character in a Charles Dickens novel: Il y a dans un roman de Dickens une brave dame qui passe son temps \u00e0 s\u2019occuper des indig\u00e8nes de Borrisbola-Ghaa sur la c\u00f4te d\u2019Afrique\u2014mais qui oublie totalement l\u2019existence de son mari et de ses enfants. Le sieur Casement rappelle cette bonne femme, avec l\u2019infamie en plus. Casement\u2019s friendship with Germany was outlined in every article. Le Soir told Casement\u2019s story from the\n\nquestion: What did the report confirm?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1030}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The latter was in favor of Casement\u2019s suggestion to build an army from Irish prisoners of war to fight for the Irish cause. Casement\u2019s treason threw into doubt all the allegations that he made in 1903 on the Belgian administration of the CFS. In light of these events, the Casement Report was completely nullified by the Belgian society of the Great War. Casement\u2019s alignment with Germany was, to the papers, further proof that this man was not to be trusted and that his report was just a pack of lies. In Le Soir, for instance, dating back to April 1916, Casement\u2019s report was fully discredited: \u201cLa plupart des horribles \u00e9pisodes racont\u00e9s par cet \u00e9trange consul \u00e9taient exag\u00e9r\u00e9s et en partie invent\u00e9s  Il \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 ma\u00eetre dans l\u2019art de truquer les photographies et de falsifier les documents.\u201d British attitudes completely changed with regards to the Casement Report. The British that had proclaimed for all the world to hear the atrocities that were taking place in the Belgian Congo now apologized for being \u201cduped\u201d by the traitor Casement. Le Soir reported that the British press expressed \u201cun vif regret d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 entrain\u00e9e par ce tra\u00eetre.\u201d Casement\u2019s report was now being perceived a tool to create a gap between Belgium and England for the benefit of Germany. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle wrote passionately about this particular issue: Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de brouiller la Belgique et l\u2019Angleterre, et, par surcroit la France et l\u2019Angleterre? Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats politiques de l\u2019Allemagne, int\u00e9r\u00eats continentaux et int\u00e9r\u00eats coloniaux compris? Il est grand temps que la r\u00e9putation de la Belgique \u2018calomni\u00e9e\u2019 dans cette affaire, soit enfin r\u00e9habilit\u00e9e. In the light of these events, Belgian papers presented the Belgian Congo colony as being coveted by Germany. Le Soir, for one, wrote that \u201cMorel et Casement  travaillaient \u00e0 d\u00e9pouiller la Belgique de sa colonie, au profit de l\u2019Allemagne.\u201d All in all Casement\u2019s treason was, for Belgium and the Belgian Congo, holy bread. L\u00e9opold II and his humanitarian work in the Congo was now restored to good faith. L\u00e9opold II got his revenge, and the Belgian Congo, former Congo Free State, was reestablished among the model colonies in Africa. L\u00e9opold\u2019s \u0153uvre was \u201cveng\u00e9e des accusations du tra\u00eetre Casement,\u201d  wrote Le Soir. For those living in 1905 and 1906, when L\u00e9opold II was \u201cl\u2019objet d\u2019inf\u00e2mes outrages dans la presse \u00e9trang\u00e8re,\u201d these revelations were \u201cune \u00e9clatante revanche et une grande consolation.\u201d \u201cQuelle revanche,\u201d wrote Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, \u201cpour L\u00e9opold II et nos h\u00e9ros africains que les campagnes des complices de la barbarie allemande avaient r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire passer, m\u00eame aux yeux de certains de leurs compatriotes, pour de monstrueux criminels.\u201d III. Conclusion Roger Casement\u2019s report and the end of the CFS are considered today to be intrinsically connected to one another, the former leading to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo. This connection, however, as this paper hopes to have shown, is much more in the realm of myth than it is of actual historical reality. The direct link that exists in popular imagination between the report and the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo is a simplification of the role and impact of Casement\u2019s denunciatory report. Casement\u2019s report is first and foremost the work of an emphatic man who wished to denounce the suffering of the Congolese population. In Great Britain and the Anglophone world as a whole, the report had a great impact upon both the political and popular spheres of the country. Such an impact can be understood within the recurrent charges of maladministration that took place on L\u00e9opold\u2019s territory since 1895. Casement\u2019s report kindled the spark to this fire of\n\nquestion: What did the report confirm?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1017}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In Belgium, however, the role and impact of the Casement Report was of a totally different nature. Political opinions oscillated between rejection of the report and support for its humanitarian concerns. Belgian socialists and liberals never hesitated in condemning the abuse taking place in the CFS, while the catholics cast a great shadow over the truth and veracity of Casement\u2019s statements. The use of a foreign report, however, was not acceptable within Belgian politics and an enquiry commission was established. The debate, therefore, was not on the basis of Casement\u2019s report, but rather on that of the enquiry commission. The Casement Report was but a piece in the domino effect that led to the annexation of the Congo to Belgium. Even after the annexation, the relentless attack upon L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo awakened Belgium\u2019s national pride. As a reaction there was a phenomenon of collective amnesia concerning the abuse, and L\u00e9opold II was put on a pedestal. The outbreak of the First World War resuscitated the figure of Roger Casement in yet another perspective. The Great War was a time of propaganda where partial truths are turned into patriotic dogmas. With the growing feeling of Belgian national pride, the country framed itself sympathetically with the hanging of Roger Casement by the British authorities for treason. The papers once again insisted on Casement\u2019s report as a pack of lies intended to steal the Congo away from Belgium. Today still, former Belgian colonials look upon Casement\u2019s report as exaggerated and his campaign as mainly anti-Belgian. In the end, the anti-Congo campaign created a dualistic representation of the CFS, one that has been taken up in literature by Adam Hochschild and Mario Vargas Llosa, both of whom represent Casement as the martyr of the humanitarian cause. This image of Casement as a martyr cannot be applied to Roger Casement, who was, and will always remain, a privileged witness of L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo.

As the State asserted more and more its vitality and progress, the campaign will keep on growing, relying on some specific and isolated cases to invoke humanity as a pretext to conceal the true objective of their envy.

This report was instrumental in Leopold finally relinquishing his private holdings in Africa. Leopold had held ownership of the Congolese state since 1885, granted to him by the Berlin Conference, in which he exploited its natural resources (mostly rubber) for his own private wealth. Through intercepted letters, Captain Hubert-Joseph Lothaire, the commander of the Congo Free State forces in the Ituri-campaign, learned that Charles Stokes (born in Dublin) was on his way from German East Africa to sell weapons to the Zanzibari slavers in the eastern Congo region. Stokes was arrested and taken to Captain Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a Drumhead court-martial. Stokes was found guilty of selling guns, gunpowder and detonators to the Congo Free State's Afro-Arab enemies. On 14 January 1895 he was sentenced to death and was hanged the next day (hoisted on a tree). To Lothaire, Charles Stokes was no more than a criminal whose hanging was fully justified. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister at the time, commented that if Stokes was in league with Arab slave-trading, then 'he deserved hanging'. Sir John Kirk, for years the British Consul in Zanzibar, remarked that \"he was no loss to us, although he was an honest man.\" The news of Stokes' execution was received with indifference by the British Foreign Office. When the German ambassador asked Sir Thomas H. Sanderson, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether the British government planned to take any steps regarding the execution of this \"well-known character\", Sanderson wrote: \"I do not quite understand why the Germans are pressing us.\" In August 1895, the attention of the British press was drawn to this case by Lionel Decle, a journalist for the Pall Mall Gazette. The press began to report on these events in great detail, The Daily News emphasized 'bloodthirsty precipitation', The Times a 'painful and disgraceful death', The Liverpool Daily Post 'horrified amazement through the British race', The Daily Telegraph 'death like a dog', adding, \"Have we all been wrong in believing that the most audacious foreigner \u2013 not to speak of any savage chief \u2013 would think once, twice and even trice, before he laid hands on a subject of Queen Victoria?\". As a result, the case became an international incident, better known as the Stokes Affair. Together, Britain and Germany pressured the Congo Free State to put Lothaire on trial, which they eventually did, a first trial was held in the city of Boma. The Free State paid compensation to the British (150,000 francs) and Germans (100,000 francs) and made it impossible by decree to impose martial law or death sentences on European citizens. Stokes's body was returned to his family. Lothaire was acquitted twice, first in April 1896 by a tribunal in Boma. In August 1896, the appeal was confirmed in Brussels by the Supreme Court of Congo, paving the way for the rehabilitation of Lothaire. The Stokes Affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State. It also damaged the reputation of King Leopold II of Belgium as a benevolent despot, which he had cultivated with so much effort. The case helped encourage the foundation of the Congo Reform Association \u2013 by Roger Casement and E. D. Morel \u2013 which in its turn put pressure on the Belgian government, which helped lead to the annexation of the Congo Free State by the Belgian state in 1908. For many years prior to the Casement Report there were reports from the Congo alleging widespread abuses and exploitation of the native population. In 1895, the situation was reported to Dr Henry Grattan Guinness (1861\u20131915), a missionary doctor. He had established the Congo-Balolo Mission in 1889, and was promised action by King Leopold later in 1895, but nothing changed. H. R. Fox-Bourne of the Aborigines' Protection Society had published Civilisation in Congoland in 1903, and the journalist E. D. Morel also wrote several articles about the Leopoldian government's behaviour in the Congo Free State. On 20 May 1903 a motion by the Liberal Herbert Samuel was debated in the British House of Commons, resulting in this resolution:... That the Government of the Congo Free State having, at its inception, guaranteed to the Powers that its Native subjects should be governed with humanity, and that no trading monopoly or privilege should be permitted within its dominions, this House requests His Majesty's Government to confer with the other Powers, signatories of the Berlin General Act by virtue of which the Congo\n\nquestion: What were some of the things detailed in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "abuses in the Congo Free State, exploitation of the native population, and Charles Stokes transporting weapons to the Congo Free State's Afro-Arab enemies.", "usage": 1168}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

His report was published in 1904, confirmed Morel's accusations, and had a considerable impact on public opinion. Casement met and became friends with Morel just before the publication of his report in 1904 and realized that he had found the ally he had sought. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organization for dealing specifically with the Congo question.

Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1885, under which much of Africa had been partitioned. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. While the Report was issued as a Command paper in 1904, and was laid before the Houses of Parliament, the original was not published in full until 1985, in an annotated book by two Belgian professors of the history of colonialism. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist political leader and statesman Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold II to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives). Despite these findings, Leopold managed to retain personal control of the Congo until 1908, when the Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration as the Belgian Congo.

The report publicly denounced the atrocious systems of the rubber terror which forced Africans to extract the rubber from lianas to the profit of the State or concessionaries. Published in Great Britain in 1904, the report caused great outrage. The impact of the report in Belgium, however, has been so far underexplored. William Roger Louis mentions the importance of this report to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime and to Belgium\u2019s takeover of the Congo. This position, however, is contested by Jules Marchal, who has stated in his work that \u201cthe king had not to fear a reaction from the Belgian public who showed little interest in the Congo.\u201d None of these studies, however, have looked in depth at the impact of the publication of the Casement Report on the official reactions and on popular opinion in Belgium. This paper seeks to do just that. Keywords Roger Casement, King L\u00e9opold II, Congo Free State, Casement Report, Belgian Congo, Belgium, Commission of Inquiry, anti-Congo campaigns Introduction In July 1903, Roger Casement, as part of his duties as British consul, set out on a journey to the rubber regions of the Congo Free State (henceforth \u201cCFS\u201d). In February 1904, the publication of his report on the harsh living conditions of the indigenous population aroused much indignation within official and popular spheres in Great Britain. Very quickly, Casement and Edmund Morel founded the Congo Reform Association (henceforth \u201cC.R.A\u201d) and proclaimed their goal of putting an end to King L\u00e9opold II\u2019s Congo. And thus started one of the first humanitarian campaigns, one which, in spite of the end of the Congo Free State and its annexation to Belgium in 1908, continued its efforts until 1913. In the wake of the publication of the report in Great Britain, two very different courses of action were put in place. The first was official: the governmental spheres aimed at keeping the balance among European nations and expressing courtesy towards allied countries. The second course of action concerned public opinion: the C.R.A stepped up their propaganda against the CFS in order to stir the hearts of the British people into action. The role of the Casement Report was very different in each case. Officially, Great Britain used it in the hopes of reopening the Congo question with the signatories of the Berlin Conference. For the British people, the Report was certainly the trigger for the creation of the C.R.A but was also quickly replaced both by testimonies, primarily of Protestant missionaries, and by Morel\u2019s multiple books and pamphlets on the ill-treatment of the indigenous population. If studies on Casement\u2019s life and actions are manifold, the analysis of the reception of Casement\u2019s report and its impact in Belgium are important and, yet, relatively neglected research areas. In addition, the passing remarks on the subject are largely contradictory. William Roger Louis argues that the report was a major factor in the end of the CFS: \u201cCasement\u2019s report and his establishment of the C.R.A.,\u201d writes Louis, \u201cwere two feats that contributed greatly to the eventual downfall of the Leopoldian system, and the annexation of the Congo by Belgium.\u201d Jules Marchal, however, expresses the opinion that, because the Belgian population showed \u201clittle interest in the Congo,\u201d its impact was de-facto insignificant. In his contribution, he nevertheless recognizes that the real impact of the Casement Report and its role in the end of the CFS can only be really understood and evaluated by looking at the official and popular spheres within Belgium itself. It is true that the Congolese question was, first and foremost, an issue within Belgian domestic political affairs. Since 1890, Belgium was heir to L\u00e9opold II; and, since 1901, the Belgian Parliament could have started the annexation procedure of the Congo Free State to Belgium, had it wished to do so. Internationally, too, this right was never questioned either by England or by the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference. If the anti-Congo campaign led by the C.R.A. is still remembered elsewhere today, in Belgium itself, it had very little impact, and this is for two main reasons: first, while Casement and Morel\u2019s campaign was a pressurizing factor in Great Britain, it was much less so in Belgium. And second, in a very practical sense, the working language of the report was English, which was at that time not particularly well-known in Belgium. And yet, by criticizing the CFS, Casement and Morel were attacking the King, something that did not leave the\n\nquestion: What were some of the things detailed in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "the brutal treatment of the indigenous population, the atrocious systems of the rubber terror forcing Africans to extract rubber from lianas to the profit of the State or concessionaries", "usage": 1115}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since its independence in 1830, Belgium has had a constitutional monarchy. The country has a rather liberal constitution, affording many freedoms to its citizens. One of its articles guarantees the freedom of press and stipulates that censorship can never be established, thereby engendering a quasi-absolute freedom of the press. Belgian society at the time of L\u00e9opold II was organized into different segments, each with their own ideology. There were three pillars at that time: catholic, liberal, and socialist. Each pillar had its own social institutions, including distinct political parties and newspapers. For each of these pillars, the chosen mouthpiece was the press. Political parties and newspapers were so tied up together that it was not uncommon to find parliamentarians, party leaders, and ministers as writers or newspaper editors. For example, the leader of the socialist party, Emile Vandervelde, was one of the columnists for Le Peuple; and the leader of the catholic party, Charles Woeste, was the editor-in-chief of La Revue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Circulation was good, given that about 68% of the population was literate in 1900. For these reasons, we believe that the press is an excellent indicator of the popular opinions of each of the different pillars towards the Casement Report, the anti-Congo campaigns, and the annexation of Congo to Belgium. For this article, we have chosen Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle as the representative of the catholic pillar, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the liberal mouthpiece, and Le Peuple as the expression of the socialist viewpoint. We have also included in the corpus Le Soir which defines itself as a neutral paper. Those press publications subsidized by the CFS such as La Belgique coloniale, L\u2019Etoile belge, and Le Petit Bleu have not been included in this study because their influence was not great on Belgian popular opinion. The debate on the CFS is not limited to popular reactions, and therefore we also consider the official reactions. At the time of the debate Brussels was the capital of two distinct states: Belgium and the CFS, which were only linked together by the figure of King L\u00e9opold II. Thus we scrutinize and discuss at length the reactions of both the Belgian officials and the Congolese administration. The Casement Report as a whole can be read as a travelogue. Casement wrote down his experiences and the personal testimonies of the people he met on his journey. And contrary to popular belief, the Casement Report is not a passionate denunciation of the CFS but rather a well-balanced one. Casement was not, in other words, denouncing at all costs. As Louis explains, the report is \u201cnot a verbally scathing denunciation of the Congo administration,\u201d but rather, it is \u201cunderstated.\u201d Finesse and nuance characterize Casement\u2019s approach. He recognizes the benefits of the Belgian presence on Congolese soil\u2014for instance, in the field of infrastructure\u2014and shares his concerns about the treatment of the indigenous population. The consul was horrified at the drastic depopulation of some areas, which he interpreted either as the outbreak of sleeping sickness, frequent in an African context, or the result of heavy migration to the French Congo. Casement describes the forced labor at the different concessionaries, including Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anversoise and Anglo-Belgian India Rubber company (hencefore Abir), and gives a precise description of the tax system that enslaved the population. In that particular context, he tells the story of a teenage boy, Epondo, who was missing a left hand. The boy\u2019s explanation was that his hand was cut off by a sentry, a Congolese auxiliary employed by the concessionary. Casement personally investigated his case and sent the sentry before the authorities. Casement had, of course, no way of assessing the accuracy of Epondo\u2019s testimony, an issue that will be used against him in later stages. Nevertheless, the Report remains a mirror to the situation of the CFS in 1903. This paper looks at the role and impact of the Casement Report in Belgium. Its assessment within Belgium will help us to understand the part that it played in the end of the CFS and the development of the Belgian Congo. Ultimately, we wish to complicate the connection between Casement\u2019s report and the end of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo, which up to this point has been overly simplified. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part looks at those reactions immediately following the publication of the report, which range from outright hostility to passionate support for the humanitarian cause. This first part also looks at the official responses from the CFS and the inquiry commission set up by the King, which together constitute the official documents of the debate. Casement\u2019s report then comes back in 1912 when the consul wrote another damning condemnation on his\n\nquestion: What were some of the things detailed in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "forced labor at different concessionaries, tax system that enslaved the population, depopulation of some areas, and the story of the teenage boy, Epondo.", "usage": 1135}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Of particular interest are the widely differing reactions to it. The last part of the analysis looks at the reception of the Casement Report at the time of the First World War, a time of propaganda and mythical representations. At this time, Belgians had yet another take on the Casement Report. The anti-Congo campaigns were relentless at this point, pushing Belgian citizens to support the King and to deny the atrocities that had taken place. In addition Casement had been hanged for treason by the British. These two factors combined led to a complete disavowal of the Report. I. Edmund Morel\u2019s Campaign and the Casement Report (1903-1904) The name of Roger Casement and the anti-Congo campaigns are inextricably linked. While being a document among many others condemning King L\u00e9opold\u2019s kingdom, Casement\u2019s report remains a touchstone in anti-Congo campaigns. The intensity of the reactions to the report can only be understood by looking at the context of the creation of the CFS and what it stood for. In his burning ambitions of expanding abroad, L\u00e9opold II did not have the support of the financial and political elites of the country. The different parliamentary majorities saw in this expansion project the endangerment of Belgium\u2019s neutrality, and/or a real danger for Belgium\u2019s neutrality. For the liberals, the immediate priority was to keep good relations with neighboring countries, mainly for the development of the economy. In opposition, the socialists denounced the exploitation of the masses both in the industries and in the colonies. And Belgium\u2019s catholic government of the time, while it did not want to get involved in the Congo question, welcomed the idea of establishing catholic missions abroad. Faced with such opposition, L\u00e9opold II decided to act as an individual. In 1870, the King took up the argument of the civilizing mission. His reputation as a philanthropist had been consistently growing both in Belgium and abroad. The King\u2019s humanitarian interest found echo in the Anglophone world that was thoroughly involved with the abolitionist cause. In other words, the civilizing mission had truly become the leitmotiv of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. For this reason, among others, the CFS would be under the gaze of international public opinion. At the outset, L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan was to operate without imposing customs or import duties. While this option proved to be positive for the creation of the CFS, financially it was untenable\u2014so untenable, in fact, that the King was forced to invest his own finances into the CFS. Debts kept growing and, on the verge of bankruptcy, the King decided to drastically change the economic policy of the CFS. Gone were the days of barter with the local population. Emphasis was now on the harvesting of goods, more specifically rubber and ivory. But this new system also led to the use of violence: the military force now came into play to make sure that the demands of harvesting were met. And with the use of the military force came a plethora of violent acts and atrocities, including rape, murder, and mutilation. The atrocities linked to the rubber trade were then not a sought-out politic of L\u00e9opold II, but rather an indirect consequence of his economic position. In 1895, a campaign\u2014in The Times, among others\u2014denounced the abuse in the CFS. Hearing of these allegations, the Belgian King promised changes and reforms and, in that way, managed to keep the reputation of the CFS intact\u2014that is, until the arrival on the scene of Edmund Morel. Hired by Sir Alfred Jones, business partner of L\u00e9opold II, Morel used his pen to defend the cause of ship-owners in Liverpool. As a clerk for the company Morel noticed that the ships leaving Belgium for the Congo carried guns, chains, and explosives but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the CFS came back full of valuable products such as rubber and ivory. This discovery led him to understand the exploitative nature of the regime. To defend the welfare of Africans, Morel launched his own newspaper\u2014The West African Mail\u2014to denounce the brutal exploitation of the natives. This new publication immediately drew the attention of the CFS. The association of Jones and Morel later fuelled the Belgian fantasy that claimed the merchants of Liverpool were plotting against the country. Morel played an important role in the adoption\u2014by the House of Commons on May 20, 1903\u2014of a motion suggested by British Liberal M.P. Herbert Samuel on the Congo question. Samuel\u2019s motion, based on humanitarian and economic arguments, hoped to reconvene the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference\u2014including Belgium\u2014to discuss once again the Congolese question. In Belgium, the\n\nquestion: What were some of the things detailed in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Roger Casement's report highlighted the exploitation, violence, and atrocities committed in the Congo Free State, including the military use to enforce the demands of harvesting rubber and ivory, and the brutal exploitation of the indigenous population.", "usage": 1140}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  motion created a form of awkwardness and embarrassment, but not much more. Only Emile Vandervelde, emblematic figure of the socialist movement, and Georges Lorand, a liberal progressive politician, made a stand against the scandal that erupted in the CFS. The socialist deputy suggested to Paul de Favereau, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to intervene in order to shed light on the alleged atrocities. This proposal, however, was rejected on the grounds that Belgium cannot intervene in the affairs of another sovereign State. The very few reactions to this British motion reflected the disengagement that Belgium felt towards the Congo question. L\u00e9opold II did not wish to see the Congolese question placed on the agenda of European governments. The King, in a state of denial about the atrocities, considered these allegations as lies to serve a campaign of covetousness of the CFS by the \u201ccorsaire\u201d Morel, part of an attempt of the British to get their hands on the Congo Free State. The King then launched his own counter-propaganda. One of his first initiatives was to encourage the creation of the FEDIBE (La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration pour la Defense des Inter\u00eats Belges \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tranger) and that of its official organ, La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur le Congo. The drafting of these texts were naturally provided by the Congolese administration. Blamed for mistreatment towards the Congolese people, the King planned another initiative: the enactment of a law in October 1903 limiting the mandatory services of the indigenous people to around forty hours of work per month. Finally, the CFS answered the British motion in contemptuous terms suggesting that it was a plot organized by the merchants of Liverpool. The Congolese government did not suspect at this stage that Casement was authorized in September 1902 to make a journey to the Upper Congo. Early in 1903, Casement already gave a report on the inequalities of the system in place within the CFS. In May, he was appointed official investigator, and the Foreign Office, aware of the parliamentary debates on the Congo question, encouraged him to leave on his journey as soon as possible. On June 5, the Consul left Matadi. He followed the river and passed through L\u00e9opoldville (Kinshasa) and Coquilhatville (Mbandaka), two major cities in the CFS, but he also abandoned his river path to penetrate deeper into the African country. He spent three weeks at Lake Matumba (la Ntomba) that is located in the Domaine de la Couronne, personal property of King L\u00e9opold II. He also stayed for five days in Bongandanga, the ABIR station, on the Lopori River. This last week was crucial to Casement, as he thought he had collected enough material for his report. On September 11, he began his journey back to the Lower Congo and left the African continent to return to Europe on November 7th to begin his report. II. Belgian Reactions to the Casement Report a.1903-1906: The Casement Report and its Responses 1.December 1903\u2014Mid-March 1904: The Casement Report The British consul finalized Casement\u2019s report in December 1903, and it was published in February of the following year. The first official reactions were dated two months prior to the publication of the report. They were full of worry, fear, and suspicion. Pending the publication of the report, L\u00e9opold II threatened to reorient his policy to be closer to Germany. The King desperately wanted his hands on the report, and he sent Sir Alfred Jones, his associate in maritime affairs and consul of the CFS in Liverpool, twice to the Foreign Office to get an exclusive copy of it. In this atmosphere of great suspicion about England\u2019s ulterior motives in this report, the Count of Lalaing, who was Belgian ambassador in London, tried his best to reassure the governmental spheres that the English posed no threat to the Congo. To that end, Lalaing repeated the words of Lord Lansdowne that Britain did not wish to own any part of the CFS. And, upon sending the Casement Report to Brussels, Lalaing shared a confidence qualifying the Report\u2019s tone as fairly moderate. Of course, great was the ambassador\u2019s disappointment when the British press blatantly attacked the Congo and presented it on its front page news as hell on earth. In spite of these setbacks, the Belgian ambassador continued to work towards some form of appeasement between the various parties. During a dinner at Buckingham, for instance, he had a discussion with the Duke of Argyll, Edward VII\u2019s brother-in-law, who ultimately listened attentively to his claims. However, the relationship between the two ruling houses had, according to Edward VII, deteriorated, and it was not part of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan to improve\n\nquestion: What were some of the things detailed in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Casement gave a report on the inequalities of the system in place within the CFS and on the atrocities in the Congo Free State.", "usage": 1132}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  it. The King had become, as his close collaborators reveal, rather bitter in his later years, and it had become impossible for him to bear any contradiction. King L\u00e9opold\u2019s response to the Casement Report was vindictive. He warned the signatory members that the response of the CFS to the Casement Report would shed light on these allegations and establish the very circumstances reported by the British consul. His personal conviction was that \u201cles attaques exag\u00e9r\u00e9es de M. Casement contre les agents Congolais\u201d justified the word \u201clibel\u201d used by the Belgian consul in Liverpool, Edouard S\u00e8ve. Reprimanded by Foreign Affairs, S\u00e8ve\u2019s attitude was illustrative of the zeal of certain diplomats who wanted to get noticed by the Royal Palace, diplomats such as Charles Sarol\u00e9a, who directly opposed Morel. By contrast, Sir Alfred Jones adopted a rather different attitude towards the problem and strongly recommended avoiding controversy in relation to the Casement Report. Jones nevertheless remained extremely active in the Congo question and hired a number of people who, under the safe umbrella of neutrality, started conducting a number of counter-investigations. One of these people is Lord Mountmorres, an Irish peer who officially worked for the London journal, The Globe. The Irishman sent a report to the Foreign Office that he later published in book form. In his conclusion, Mountmorres made a case in favor of the Congolese administration. The CFS, he argued, was governed humanely. The blame of these atrocities, he continued in his report, fell on the greedy concessionaries. The CFS did not bear, therefore, more responsibility than any other colonial regime. The Belgian press\u2014except for the socialists\u2014mirrored these official concerns. Except for Le Peuple, most press organizations were highly critical of the Casement Report. Most of their reports were filled with downright hostility. The papers emphasized the only positive point in the report: that of the very much-improved state of the infrastructure and the abolishment of the slave trade. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle stressed \u201cl\u2019\u00e9nergie montr\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s belges\u201d to improve what they called, one of the wildest regions in Africa. The rest of their reports discredited both the man himself and his report. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge saw the report as having \u201cun caract\u00e8re tendencieux,\u201d mainly because Casement\u2019s trip lasted two months only, instead of the six that were officially planned. For the liberal paper, L\u00e9opold II accomplished \u201cune \u0153uvre de civilisation et de progr\u00e8s \u00e0 laquelle nulle autre n\u2019est comparable dans l\u2019ordre colonial.\u201d Le Soir, in an article dating back to December 1903, stated that Casement\u2019s work just amounted to \u201cune campagne de d\u00e9nigrement vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019Etat ind\u00e9pendant.\u201d Casement\u2019s findings relating to cruelty and oppression were directly discredited by referring to the counter-investigation carried out in the immediate aftermath of the publication by Marquis Bosco, judge in the CFS. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, compared Casement\u2019s and Bosco\u2019s findings, arguing in favor of the latter. According to the paper, while the English accused the Europeans of cruelty on the Congolese, Bosco demonstrated that these alleged cases of mutilation dated back more than ten years and therefore could not be the responsibility of Europeans. The discourse around British covetousness of the Congo imbued the newspaper articles. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, spoke of \u201cparti pris dans les affaires du Congo.\u201d Le Peuple was the only newspaper of those we examined that had another perspective on the Casement Report. The socialist paper presented the findings as facts \u201cdont l\u2019horreur fait fr\u00e9mir\u201d and wrote of \u201ccaoutchouc rouge.\u201d Le Peuple showed its true opposition to the system in the CFS after the publication of the inquiry commission. Reactions to the Casement Report were diverse in 1903. Except for Le Peuple, which stood for equal chances for all, the rest of these reactions\u2014both official and popular\u2014were shown to be quite distrustful of the report, often deeming it an exaggeration or a ploy to reconvene the Berlin Conference and discuss the Congo case. Words like \u201cexaggeration,\u201d \u201csuspicion,\u201d \u201cmistrust,\u201d \u201cBritish covetousness\u201d and \u201chorror\u201d were used to decry what Casement witnessed in and\n\nquestion: What were some of the things detailed in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Atrocities and cruelty in the Congo Free State.", "usage": 1051}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It definitely led to passionate reactions among the Belgians, some feeling outrage at what they saw as an attack, and others feeling consternation at the treatment of the native population whom, according to the Berlin Conference, the Europeans were supposed to protect. 2.Mid-March 1904\u2014March 1905: Congo Free State Response The CFS gave its official response to the Casement Report on March 12, 1904. The suggestion made by the Congo Free State to conduct a private investigation into Casement\u2019s allegations\u2014just as Joseph Chamberlain had promised for the Fiji Islands\u2014caught the attention of the Foreign Office. This response, and its idea to launch a private investigation, was well-received by the Foreign Office. Francis Villiers, future British ambassador in Brussels, strongly recommended that this inquiry be led by an international commission. Bound by its statement, the Congo Free State sent three commissioners\u2014a Belgian, an Italian, and a Swiss\u2014to assess the situation in the country between October 1904 and February 1905. Neither Casement nor Morel believed in the efficiency of this commission, whose members were, in some form or other, connected to the King. The findings of the international commission were rather more nuanced than Casement\u2019s report. On the whole, it confirmed that atrocities were being committed on Congolese soil but presented the facts with their grey areas. They clearly established that the Epondo case was an exaggeration, a testimony that Casement failed to verify. The findings also suggested possible explanations for the type of behavior exhibited in the Congo (for example, climate, lack of morals, abuse of power, pressure for results). In general, their findings could be considered as more rational and nuanced than those of the Casement Report. In this period immediately following the Congo Free State response, each paper kept the stance that they had established towards the Casement Report. The Catholic and Liberal press emphasized the arguments that offered a more favorable vision of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. Both Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge published the report and were hoping that the response by the CFS would clear up \u201cun malentendu\u201d created by \u201cdes \u00e9l\u00e9ments anglais.\u201d Commenting upon the atrocities, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge wrote that these, which were at first considered as \u201cincontestables,\u201d had now been shown to be refutable. The paper illustrated its claims by means of two examples. First it discussed at length the well-known Epondo case, once the symbol of the oppression of the system and now simply the victim of a hunting accident. And second, in a later article, the paper discussed another mistake made by Casement. Casement had seen a dozen Congolese men travelling in a train carriage from L\u00e9opoldville to Matadi. They were tied up and controlled under the watchful eye of a soldier, leading the consul to believe they were involved in the rubber scandal. In point of fact, these people were a group of men condemned by the Court in Basoko who had come to Matadi to serve their sentence. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge confirmed its full support to the regime in the CFS and expressed its strong disagreement with the idea that the Congo administration led to \u201cun r\u00e9gime syst\u00e9matique de cruaut\u00e9s ou d\u2019oppression.\u201d The paper, nevertheless, acknowledged that some wrongdoings happened in the country, just as they had in any other colony. But then the paper immediately suggested a number of possible suggestions for these acts of cruelty. It argued that when such deeds had been committed, the perpetrators had been severely punished. It then advised its readers to bear in mind the difficulties Belgians had to face in the heart of Africa, a country with more than two hundred languages and where roads had yet to be built. According to L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, the English should have thought \u201caux difficult\u00e9s qui assaillent les officiers au Congo.\u201d It would be easy to condemn, wrote the paper, when \u201con est assis chez soi \u00e0 l\u2019abri du besoin.\u201d The English, therefore, should give some thought \u201c\u00e0 la mentalit\u00e9 de ces hommes bris\u00e9s de corps et d\u2019esprit dans une lutte perp\u00e9tuelle.\u201d Le Soir wrote a number of articles that defended the country against the Casement Report. In its issue of June 30, 1904, the newspaper interviewed Paul Landbeck, an official working in the CFS. Landbeck strongly contested all the allegations of the British consul against the Free State. His view was that the series of atrocities outlined by Casement were carried out fifteen or twenty years ago before the government stepped in to establish law and order. He put the responsibility\n\nquestion: What were some of the things detailed in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Neither Casement nor Morel believed in the efficiency of this commission, whose members were, in some form or other, connected to the King.

L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge believed that the English started their anti-Congo campaigns at the time when the Free State was becoming an extremely prosperous state. The paper held the view that the English blamed the atrocities on the Congo administration with an ulterior motive, that of getting their hands on the Free State: A partir de 1895, le commerce de l\u2019Etat du Congo prend un essor marqu\u00e9, et le chiffre des exportations monte progressivement de 10 millions en 1895 \u00e0 50 millions en 1902.

Le Peuple, however, faithful to its belief in a better treatment for all, continued to fight to expose the atrocities. It disagreed with the response by the Congo Free State and sided with Casement and English views on the issue. In June 1904, Le Peuple, to show its support to Casement, quoted at length three other sources in Sir Charles Dilke, English liberal politician, Sir John Garot, and Count Earl Percy, the British Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Dilke claimed that the Congo Free State was \u201cun enfer sur terre.\u201d Sir John Garot followed suit and argued that the country was \u201cune immense cuve dans laquelle fermentent les atrocit\u00e9s, les oppressions et les cruaut\u00e9s.\u201d The positions established in 1903-1904 continued in the same line of thought. Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle supported the response by the Congo Free State, relieving Belgium from blame in these allegations. The argument of British covetousness gathered momentum as the anti-Congo campaigns continued. Emile Vandervelde and Le Peuple, on the other hand, siding with the Casement Report, were still fighting for the defense of the native population in the Free State. Their campaign to expose the atrocities in the Congo Free State took its full measure in the next phase, in the response to the report of the inquiry commission. 3.March 1905 - November 1905: The Commission Report The inquiry commission came back in March 1905 from the Free State and its report was published in November 1905. Because it was published in the Bulletin Officiel, the official journal of the Congo Free State, this report was not accessible to the masses, but rather to a small minority of learned and interested people invested in the Congo question. In addition to the report\u2019s relative lack of visibility, the celebrations for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Belgian independence stirred up dormant patriotic feelings in Belgium. The two major political parties\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014touted the King\u2019s genius. The politicians were aware that an impressive program of embellishment and aggrandizement of Belgium had been made possible thanks to the Congo. The socialist leader, again bravely challenged the government about the atrocities against the native population but, just like in 1903, his concerns fell on deaf ears. The Congo question was compared by Lorand to the Dreyfus case in France. It had become impossible, according to the Liberal deputy, to treat the Congo question without being accused of treason towards Belgium or of collusion with the merchants of Liverpool. It was therefore of no surprise that these\n\nquestion: What were some of the things detailed in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The report was critical of the treatment of native soldiers, criticized the response by the Congo Free State, described the links between the Casement Report and English covetousness, and supported the defense of the native population in the Free State.", "usage": 1109}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle corroborated the commission report, and, in their respective newspapers, primarily printed those findings of the commission that could speak for themselves. One newspaper, however, stood out. Le Peuple showed the full measure of its opposition to the Congo system. While Vandervelde\u2019s voice was not heard in the parliamentary debates, he expressed his views in his socialist newspaper. The socialist leader and his newspaper summarized and quoted the Casement Report in the hope of exposing the cruel system of oppression. They called for a \u201ccampagne de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de piti\u00e9.\u201d The paper focused largely on Abir. The argument against the atrocities was all the more striking since Casement\u2019s findings relating to those concessionaries like Abir were confirmed in the commission report. Le Peuple made a point at presenting in detail the atrocities inflicted on the population to collect the rubber. Le Peuple printed the testimony of victims who came to testify in front of the international commission. They heard the stories of families being taken hostage by Abir because the men did not fill their quota of rubber; they were told about the armed sentries threatening the rubber carriers; they heard the stories of horrific corporal punishment, including floggings and lashes with a chicotte against those that did not fulfill their quotas. The paper described \u201cles civilisateurs Congolais\u201d as follows: On tuait sans distinction les femmes inoffensives et les enfants  Tout cela apparemment pour frapper de terreur ce malheureux peuple et le forcer \u00e0 apporter du caoutchouc  Les t\u00e9moins racont\u00e8rent qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient constamment battus avec la chicotte et que leurs femmes et leurs enfants \u00e9taient continuellement emprisonn\u00e9s, beaucoup de gens mourant soit en prison, soit imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9s. Pendant que les hommes dans la for\u00eat r\u00e9coltaient le caoutchouc, leurs femmes \u00e9taient outrag\u00e9es, maltrait\u00e9es ou enlev\u00e9es par les sentinelles  L\u2019histoire de l\u2019ABIR dans ces r\u00e9gions-ci est une histoire d\u2019oppression, de sang vers\u00e9 et d\u2019iniquit\u00e9. Il lui sera bien difficile d\u2019expier ses torts envers la population. This work of vulgarization and spreading of the Casement Report continued until 1906 when two major works vulgarized the commission report and thereby made it available to a much wider audience. The first of these major works was by liberal F\u00e9licien Cattier, Professor at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles; the other was by Father Vermeersch, a Jesuit. Interestingly, the vulgarization of the report came from two political strands\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014that were at the time staunch supporters of the Congo Free State. Father Vermeersch\u2019s book introduced catholic opinion to the possibility that the anti-Congo campaigns were not simply an attack against the Free State by Protestant missionaries. The annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium soon became a most viable solution. The proposal of annexation was taken so seriously that, led by Vandervelde, the debates were reopened on the Congo question in February 1906. Cattier\u2019s book and the commission report became the touchstones to start reforming the regime of the Congo Free State. During the discussion on the annexation of the Congo, references to Casement were rare, just as were those to Morel. A few days before the annexation in October 1908, Vandervelde once again emphasized the importance of the consul in this thorny issue. b.1910-1914: The Casement Report and the Putumayo Atrocities After his report on the CFS, Casement served as consul in various parts of the world, including Lisbon, the Brazilian port of Santos, followed by S\u00e3o Paulo, at the mouth of the Amazon. In July 1910, Edward Grey insisted that Casement be attached to a commission going to investigate reports of atrocities on the Putumayo River of the upper Amazon. What Casement found there was another oppressive regime. Agents of this regime, reported Casement, administrated inhumane treatment on the native population. Back in Britain, in January 1911, Casement submitted his detailed and damning report to the Foreign Secretary. The British government decided in July 1912 to publish Casement\u2019s report. It was subsequently published in the Belgian\n\nquestion: What were some of the things detailed in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "horrific corporal punishment, including floggings and lashes", "usage": 1056}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Through the lens of the Putumayo Report, new light is shed on a number of interesting remarks on the Casement Report. When the Putumayo Report was commented on in Belgium in July 1912, the status of the CFS had evolved. The annexation of the Congo in 1908 as a colony of Belgium, known as the Belgian Congo, along with the King\u2019s death in 1909, had changed the situation completely. Belgium put L\u00e9opold II on a pedestal and the episode of the red rubber was erased from people\u2019s memory. A striking example of this change in perception is the case of Emile Vandervelde: the man who exposed and condemned the atrocities of the Congo during the Parliamentary debates and in heated and passionate articles in Le Peuple became, after his trip to the Congo, a fervent supporter of the colony. His policies now connected socialism and colonialism by arguing that both these movements had the moral obligation of guardianship towards the less developed people. The socialist leader then distanced himself from Morel\u2019s campaign. From the Belgian perspective, however, the Putumayo Report fell at a bad time. In 1910-12, when the Congo Free State became the Belgian Congo, its new colonial administration reacted rather poorly to the allegations about the inability of the Belgians to rule the Congo. For the authorities of the newly-created Belgian Congo, England froze interference by pursuing its consular inquiries into the Congo. Through a fear either imagined or real, the Congo remained for the Belgian authorities a coveted colony. Important discussions were taking place between Lalaing and Grey regarding the recognition by the English of the annexation of the Congo Free State to Belgium. When Casement returned from Putumayo, Count Lalaing highlighted the similar attitude that London adopted towards the Congo Free State and the Peruvian government.  Upon publication of the Putumayo Report, the British press made allusions to the Congo case and stirred up ancient feuds between the two countries. The ambassador very much regretted that the press made \u201callusions aussi blessantes qu\u2019exag\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ancien r\u00e9gime Congolais.\u201d  If The Times mentioned that the situation was worse in Peru, Morel insisted in The Economist that nothing could be compared to the CFS. The annexation was finally recognized the following year, and Grey\u2019s speech on that occasion was welcomed by L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the clearing of reckless attacks. In contrast, the Belgian government deemed that England was much too slow in her recognition of the Belgian Congo. If Lalaing highlighted similar reactions on the part of London towards both of Casement reports, the press adopted a totally different stance to Casement\u2019s Putumayo Report. There were no connections established in the papers about the fact that both reports were from the same pen. The press treated these two reports as totally distinct. Another striking difference was that, while the Casement Report was passionately debated and condemned as false (apart from a few) between 1903 and 1906, the Putumayo Report was presented in a detached manner, very matter-of-factly. The reports in Le Soir and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle took the form of factual lists of atrocities committed by the Peruvian Amazon Company on the indigenous population to collect rubber in all their excruciating details. The comparison of the treatment established two important facts: the first one was that there was indeed a complete amnesia in Belgium about the Congo atrocities. Not one reference was made to Casement, the damned and criticized author of the report on the CFS. And secondly, the difference in treatments highlighted the fact that, between 1903 and 1906, there was a passionate debate about the Congo question. The Casement Report, contrary to what Jules Marchal argues, did trigger interest and passionate debate among the Belgian population. c.1914-1918: The Casement Report and the Great War At the time of the outbreak of the Great War, Casement was retired. This retirement, however, was rather short lived. He turned his interest to Ireland\u2019s political turmoil. In 1914 Ireland, different political factions opposed each other on the issue of Home Rule, which would grant a Dublin government for the whole of Ireland. Unionists opposed the bill because they feared a loss of power; constitutional nationalists and John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, supported the Home Rule bill. To put actions into words, he urged Irishmen to enlist in the British army. Within the nationalists, there was a more radical Republican wing that included well-known names such as Patrick Pearse, Thomas Clarke, Sean McDermott, and\u2026Roger Casement. The former British consul had decided to fight alongside the republicans in the hope of the birth of an independent Ireland, free and not part of any Empire. Casement sought to obtain German support for a rebellion against English rule\u2014the Easter Rising. Shortly before\n\nquestion: What were some of the things detailed in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1109}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was convicted and executed for treason. Casement\u2019s involvement in these republican activities ultimately had a profound effect on the perspective of the Casement Report within Belgium. There were very few official responses to Casement\u2019s fate. Casement\u2019s involvement in the Easter Rising and his subsequent arrest were barely mentioned by the Belgian embassy in London. The Belgian Congo\u2019s mother country was deemed at this time \u201cpoor little Belgium,\u201d a country that the British needed to rescue after the German invasion of its territory. Despite the laudatory speeches and gestures of support, King Albert and the Belgian government were deeply concerned by the German occupation of Belgium and by the possible damage to the integrity of the national territory both of Belgium and of the Belgian Congo after the conflict. In this time of great crisis for Belgium, Casement\u2019s trial was not an object of interest for Belgian officials. Instead of going back to ancient feuds, the ambassador, Paul Hymans, worked towards the organization of two Anglo-Belgian events that would demonstrate the intimate friendship between the two countries. Success was complete, and Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, in his speeches, glorified the Belgian attitude. By coincidence, the two events took place shortly before and after Casement\u2019s execution on August 3, 1916. Then, too, the execution of the former consul was not exploited by Belgian officials. Hymans\u2019 personality played a big role in that fact. Following the publication of Morel\u2019s Truth and the War at the end of August, part of the public opinion\u2014including British\u2014was struck by the coincidence between Morel\u2019s statements in 1911, in which he advocated for an Anglo-German rapprochement on the basis of the sharing of the Congo, and the revelations at Casement\u2019s trial. From there emerged the idea that Morel and Casement were agents in the service of Germany, whose aim it was to create tensions between Belgium and Great Britain on the Congo question. This development, however, was rejected by the ambassador, who trusted history to decide on the issue. However, three important elements reversed the situation completely: first, the creation of a propaganda division at the ministry of the colonies in 1916; second, Morel\u2019s condemnation in 1917; and third, the need to look victimized at the peace conference. Now Minister of Foreign affairs, Hymans signed a note for the diplomats, prepared by Octave Louwers. If Louwers, as a young magistrate in the Congo Free State, denounced L\u00e9opold II as a scoundrel, the minister\u2019s adviser suggested not to be intimidated by the memory of the \u201catrocities,\u201d because if L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime had not been faultless, its benefits were too long overshadowed by the accusations orchestrated by questionable characters. Sir Herbert Samuel, author of the motion in May 1903, bowed a quarter of a century later in front of the Belgian work that was now at the forefront of progressive and enlightened colonial administrations. The myth that Morel and Casement were agents of Germany resurged throughout the whole period of the Belgian Congo. While there were very few references to Casement\u2019s fate in the official spheres, the press, on the other hand, turned the Casement\u2019s trial and his hanging into its main headlines. Casement was, in the Belgian press, a \u201ctra\u00eetre.\u201d Le Soir, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge reported Casement\u2019s arrest in every detail, branding him as \u201cIrlando-Boche,\u201d \u201cun agent de l\u2019Allemagne\u201d, and \u201cinventeur et le colporteur de l\u2019abominable l\u00e9gende des \u2018mains coup\u00e9es\u2019.\u201d With an ironic twist, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle asked \u201co\u00f9 sont ces belles d\u00e9clamations sur les atrocit\u00e9s congolaise, sur le \u2018caoutchouc rouge,\u2019 les vibrantes tirades humanitaires?\u201d The journalist compared Casement to a character in a Charles Dickens novel: Il y a dans un roman de Dickens une brave dame qui passe son temps \u00e0 s\u2019occuper des indig\u00e8nes de Borrisbola-Ghaa sur la c\u00f4te d\u2019Afrique\u2014mais qui oublie totalement l\u2019existence de son mari et de ses enfants. Le sieur Casement rappelle cette bonne femme, avec l\u2019infamie en plus. Casement\u2019s friendship with Germany was outlined in every article. Le Soir told Casement\u2019s story from the\n\nquestion: What were some of the things detailed in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The report detailed the involvement of Casement in republican activities, the Belgian embassy's response to his arrest and execution, and propaganda efforts to downplay the atrocities in the Congo Free State.", "usage": 1070}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The latter was in favor of Casement\u2019s suggestion to build an army from Irish prisoners of war to fight for the Irish cause. Casement\u2019s treason threw into doubt all the allegations that he made in 1903 on the Belgian administration of the CFS. In light of these events, the Casement Report was completely nullified by the Belgian society of the Great War. Casement\u2019s alignment with Germany was, to the papers, further proof that this man was not to be trusted and that his report was just a pack of lies. In Le Soir, for instance, dating back to April 1916, Casement\u2019s report was fully discredited: \u201cLa plupart des horribles \u00e9pisodes racont\u00e9s par cet \u00e9trange consul \u00e9taient exag\u00e9r\u00e9s et en partie invent\u00e9s  Il \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 ma\u00eetre dans l\u2019art de truquer les photographies et de falsifier les documents.\u201d British attitudes completely changed with regards to the Casement Report. The British that had proclaimed for all the world to hear the atrocities that were taking place in the Belgian Congo now apologized for being \u201cduped\u201d by the traitor Casement. Le Soir reported that the British press expressed \u201cun vif regret d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 entrain\u00e9e par ce tra\u00eetre.\u201d Casement\u2019s report was now being perceived a tool to create a gap between Belgium and England for the benefit of Germany. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle wrote passionately about this particular issue: Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de brouiller la Belgique et l\u2019Angleterre, et, par surcroit la France et l\u2019Angleterre? Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats politiques de l\u2019Allemagne, int\u00e9r\u00eats continentaux et int\u00e9r\u00eats coloniaux compris? Il est grand temps que la r\u00e9putation de la Belgique \u2018calomni\u00e9e\u2019 dans cette affaire, soit enfin r\u00e9habilit\u00e9e. In the light of these events, Belgian papers presented the Belgian Congo colony as being coveted by Germany. Le Soir, for one, wrote that \u201cMorel et Casement  travaillaient \u00e0 d\u00e9pouiller la Belgique de sa colonie, au profit de l\u2019Allemagne.\u201d All in all Casement\u2019s treason was, for Belgium and the Belgian Congo, holy bread. L\u00e9opold II and his humanitarian work in the Congo was now restored to good faith. L\u00e9opold II got his revenge, and the Belgian Congo, former Congo Free State, was reestablished among the model colonies in Africa. L\u00e9opold\u2019s \u0153uvre was \u201cveng\u00e9e des accusations du tra\u00eetre Casement,\u201d  wrote Le Soir. For those living in 1905 and 1906, when L\u00e9opold II was \u201cl\u2019objet d\u2019inf\u00e2mes outrages dans la presse \u00e9trang\u00e8re,\u201d these revelations were \u201cune \u00e9clatante revanche et une grande consolation.\u201d \u201cQuelle revanche,\u201d wrote Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, \u201cpour L\u00e9opold II et nos h\u00e9ros africains que les campagnes des complices de la barbarie allemande avaient r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire passer, m\u00eame aux yeux de certains de leurs compatriotes, pour de monstrueux criminels.\u201d III. Conclusion Roger Casement\u2019s report and the end of the CFS are considered today to be intrinsically connected to one another, the former leading to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo. This connection, however, as this paper hopes to have shown, is much more in the realm of myth than it is of actual historical reality. The direct link that exists in popular imagination between the report and the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo is a simplification of the role and impact of Casement\u2019s denunciatory report. Casement\u2019s report is first and foremost the work of an emphatic man who wished to denounce the suffering of the Congolese population. In Great Britain and the Anglophone world as a whole, the report had a great impact upon both the political and popular spheres of the country. Such an impact can be understood within the recurrent charges of maladministration that took place on L\u00e9opold\u2019s territory since 1895. Casement\u2019s report kindled the spark to this fire of\n\nquestion: What were some of the things detailed in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "the report detailed the suffering of the Congolese population", "usage": 1031}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In Belgium, however, the role and impact of the Casement Report was of a totally different nature. Political opinions oscillated between rejection of the report and support for its humanitarian concerns. Belgian socialists and liberals never hesitated in condemning the abuse taking place in the CFS, while the catholics cast a great shadow over the truth and veracity of Casement\u2019s statements. The use of a foreign report, however, was not acceptable within Belgian politics and an enquiry commission was established. The debate, therefore, was not on the basis of Casement\u2019s report, but rather on that of the enquiry commission. The Casement Report was but a piece in the domino effect that led to the annexation of the Congo to Belgium. Even after the annexation, the relentless attack upon L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo awakened Belgium\u2019s national pride. As a reaction there was a phenomenon of collective amnesia concerning the abuse, and L\u00e9opold II was put on a pedestal. The outbreak of the First World War resuscitated the figure of Roger Casement in yet another perspective. The Great War was a time of propaganda where partial truths are turned into patriotic dogmas. With the growing feeling of Belgian national pride, the country framed itself sympathetically with the hanging of Roger Casement by the British authorities for treason. The papers once again insisted on Casement\u2019s report as a pack of lies intended to steal the Congo away from Belgium. Today still, former Belgian colonials look upon Casement\u2019s report as exaggerated and his campaign as mainly anti-Belgian. In the end, the anti-Congo campaign created a dualistic representation of the CFS, one that has been taken up in literature by Adam Hochschild and Mario Vargas Llosa, both of whom represent Casement as the martyr of the humanitarian cause. This image of Casement as a martyr cannot be applied to Roger Casement, who was, and will always remain, a privileged witness of L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo.

As the State asserted more and more its vitality and progress, the campaign will keep on growing, relying on some specific and isolated cases to invoke humanity as a pretext to conceal the true objective of their envy.

This report was instrumental in Leopold finally relinquishing his private holdings in Africa. Leopold had held ownership of the Congolese state since 1885, granted to him by the Berlin Conference, in which he exploited its natural resources (mostly rubber) for his own private wealth. Through intercepted letters, Captain Hubert-Joseph Lothaire, the commander of the Congo Free State forces in the Ituri-campaign, learned that Charles Stokes (born in Dublin) was on his way from German East Africa to sell weapons to the Zanzibari slavers in the eastern Congo region. Stokes was arrested and taken to Captain Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a Drumhead court-martial. Stokes was found guilty of selling guns, gunpowder and detonators to the Congo Free State's Afro-Arab enemies. On 14 January 1895 he was sentenced to death and was hanged the next day (hoisted on a tree). To Lothaire, Charles Stokes was no more than a criminal whose hanging was fully justified. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister at the time, commented that if Stokes was in league with Arab slave-trading, then 'he deserved hanging'. Sir John Kirk, for years the British Consul in Zanzibar, remarked that \"he was no loss to us, although he was an honest man.\" The news of Stokes' execution was received with indifference by the British Foreign Office. When the German ambassador asked Sir Thomas H. Sanderson, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether the British government planned to take any steps regarding the execution of this \"well-known character\", Sanderson wrote: \"I do not quite understand why the Germans are pressing us.\" In August 1895, the attention of the British press was drawn to this case by Lionel Decle, a journalist for the Pall Mall Gazette. The press began to report on these events in great detail, The Daily News emphasized 'bloodthirsty precipitation', The Times a 'painful and disgraceful death', The Liverpool Daily Post 'horrified amazement through the British race', The Daily Telegraph 'death like a dog', adding, \"Have we all been wrong in believing that the most audacious foreigner \u2013 not to speak of any savage chief \u2013 would think once, twice and even trice, before he laid hands on a subject of Queen Victoria?\". As a result, the case became an international incident, better known as the Stokes Affair. Together, Britain and Germany pressured the Congo Free State to put Lothaire on trial, which they eventually did, a first trial was held in the city of Boma. The Free State paid compensation to the British (150,000 francs) and Germans (100,000 francs) and made it impossible by decree to impose martial law or death sentences on European citizens. Stokes's body was returned to his family. Lothaire was acquitted twice, first in April 1896 by a tribunal in Boma. In August 1896, the appeal was confirmed in Brussels by the Supreme Court of Congo, paving the way for the rehabilitation of Lothaire. The Stokes Affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State. It also damaged the reputation of King Leopold II of Belgium as a benevolent despot, which he had cultivated with so much effort. The case helped encourage the foundation of the Congo Reform Association \u2013 by Roger Casement and E. D. Morel \u2013 which in its turn put pressure on the Belgian government, which helped lead to the annexation of the Congo Free State by the Belgian state in 1908. For many years prior to the Casement Report there were reports from the Congo alleging widespread abuses and exploitation of the native population. In 1895, the situation was reported to Dr Henry Grattan Guinness (1861\u20131915), a missionary doctor. He had established the Congo-Balolo Mission in 1889, and was promised action by King Leopold later in 1895, but nothing changed. H. R. Fox-Bourne of the Aborigines' Protection Society had published Civilisation in Congoland in 1903, and the journalist E. D. Morel also wrote several articles about the Leopoldian government's behaviour in the Congo Free State. On 20 May 1903 a motion by the Liberal Herbert Samuel was debated in the British House of Commons, resulting in this resolution:... That the Government of the Congo Free State having, at its inception, guaranteed to the Powers that its Native subjects should be governed with humanity, and that no trading monopoly or privilege should be permitted within its dominions, this House requests His Majesty's Government to confer with the other Powers, signatories of the Berlin General Act by virtue of which the Congo\n\nquestion: What was the result of the shocking revelations in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "an international incident, known as the Stokes Affair", "usage": 1149}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Subsequently, the British consul at Boma in the Congo, the Irishman Roger Casement was instructed by Balfour's government to investigate. His report was published in 1904, confirmed Morel's accusations, and had a considerable impact on public opinion. Casement met and became friends with Morel just before the publication of his report in 1904 and realized that he had found the ally he had sought. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organization for dealing specifically with the Congo question. With Casement's and Dr. Guinness's assistance, he set up and ran the Congo Reform Association, which worked to end Leopold's control of the Congo Free State. Branches of the association were established as far away as the United States. The Casement Report comprises forty pages of the Parliamentary Papers, to which is appended another twenty pages of individual statements gathered by Casement as Consul, including several detailing grim tales of killings, mutilations, kidnappings and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo Administration of King Leopold. Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1885, under which much of Africa had been partitioned. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. While the Report was issued as a Command paper in 1904, and was laid before the Houses of Parliament, the original was not published in full until 1985, in an annotated book by two Belgian professors of the history of colonialism. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist political leader and statesman Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold II to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives). Despite these findings, Leopold managed to retain personal control of the Congo until 1908, when the Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration as the Belgian Congo.

The report publicly denounced the atrocious systems of the rubber terror which forced Africans to extract the rubber from lianas to the profit of the State or concessionaries. Published in Great Britain in 1904, the report caused great outrage. The impact of the report in Belgium, however, has been so far underexplored. William Roger Louis mentions the importance of this report to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime and to Belgium\u2019s takeover of the Congo. This position, however, is contested by Jules Marchal, who has stated in his work that \u201cthe king had not to fear a reaction from the Belgian public who showed little interest in the Congo.\u201d None of these studies, however, have looked in depth at the impact of the publication of the Casement Report on the official reactions and on popular opinion in Belgium. This paper seeks to do just that. Keywords Roger Casement, King L\u00e9opold II, Congo Free State, Casement Report, Belgian Congo, Belgium, Commission of Inquiry, anti-Congo campaigns Introduction In July 1903, Roger Casement, as part of his duties as British consul, set out on a journey to the rubber regions of the Congo Free State (henceforth \u201cCFS\u201d). In February 1904, the publication of his report on the harsh living conditions of the indigenous population aroused much indignation within official and popular spheres in Great Britain. Very quickly, Casement and Edmund Morel founded the Congo Reform Association (henceforth \u201cC.R.A\u201d) and proclaimed their goal of putting an end to King L\u00e9opold II\u2019s Congo. And thus started one of the first humanitarian campaigns, one which, in spite of the end of the Congo Free State and its annexation to Belgium in 1908, continued its efforts until 1913. In the wake of the publication of the report in Great Britain, two very different courses of action were put in place. The first was official: the governmental spheres aimed at keeping the balance among European nations and expressing courtesy towards allied countries. The second course of action concerned public opinion: the C.R.A stepped up their propaganda against the CFS in order to stir the hearts of the British people into action. The role of the Casement Report was very different in each case. Officially, Great Britain used it in the hopes of reopening the Congo question with the signatories of the Berlin Conference. For the British people, the Report was certainly the trigger for the creation of the C.R.A but was also quickly replaced both by testimonies, primarily of Protestant missionaries, and by Morel\u2019s multiple books and pamphlets on the ill-treatment of the indigenous population. If studies on Casement\u2019s life and actions are manifold, the analysis of the reception of Casement\u2019s report and its impact in Belgium are important and, yet, relatively neglected research areas. In addition, the passing remarks on the subject are largely contradictory. William Roger Louis argues that the report was a major factor in the end of the CFS: \u201cCasement\u2019s report and his establishment of the C.R.A.,\u201d writes Louis, \u201cwere two feats that contributed greatly to the eventual downfall of the Leopoldian system, and the annexation of the Congo by Belgium.\u201d Jules Marchal, however, expresses the opinion that, because the Belgian population showed \u201clittle interest in the Congo,\u201d its impact was de-facto insignificant. In his contribution, he nevertheless recognizes that the real impact of the Casement Report and its role in the end of the CFS can only be really understood and evaluated by looking at the official and popular spheres within Belgium itself. It is true that the Congolese question was, first and foremost, an issue within Belgian domestic political affairs. Since 1890, Belgium was heir to L\u00e9opold II; and, since 1901, the Belgian Parliament could have started the annexation procedure of the Congo Free State to Belgium, had it wished to do so. Internationally, too, this right was never questioned either by England or by the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference. If the anti-Congo campaign led by the C.R.A. is still remembered elsewhere today, in Belgium itself, it had very little impact, and this is for two main reasons: first, while Casement and Morel\u2019s campaign was a pressurizing factor in Great Britain, it was much less so in Belgium. And second, in a very practical sense, the working language of the report was English, which was at that time not particularly well-known in Belgium. And yet, by criticizing the CFS, Casement and Morel were attacking the King, something that did not leave the\n\nquestion: What was the result of the shocking revelations in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The report caused an impact in Belgium and contributed to the eventual downfall of the Leopoldian system and the annexation of the Congo by Belgium.", "usage": 1113}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since its independence in 1830, Belgium has had a constitutional monarchy. The country has a rather liberal constitution, affording many freedoms to its citizens. One of its articles guarantees the freedom of press and stipulates that censorship can never be established, thereby engendering a quasi-absolute freedom of the press. Belgian society at the time of L\u00e9opold II was organized into different segments, each with their own ideology. There were three pillars at that time: catholic, liberal, and socialist. Each pillar had its own social institutions, including distinct political parties and newspapers. For each of these pillars, the chosen mouthpiece was the press. Political parties and newspapers were so tied up together that it was not uncommon to find parliamentarians, party leaders, and ministers as writers or newspaper editors. For example, the leader of the socialist party, Emile Vandervelde, was one of the columnists for Le Peuple; and the leader of the catholic party, Charles Woeste, was the editor-in-chief of La Revue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Circulation was good, given that about 68% of the population was literate in 1900. For these reasons, we believe that the press is an excellent indicator of the popular opinions of each of the different pillars towards the Casement Report, the anti-Congo campaigns, and the annexation of Congo to Belgium. For this article, we have chosen Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle as the representative of the catholic pillar, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the liberal mouthpiece, and Le Peuple as the expression of the socialist viewpoint. We have also included in the corpus Le Soir which defines itself as a neutral paper. Those press publications subsidized by the CFS such as La Belgique coloniale, L\u2019Etoile belge, and Le Petit Bleu have not been included in this study because their influence was not great on Belgian popular opinion. The debate on the CFS is not limited to popular reactions, and therefore we also consider the official reactions. At the time of the debate Brussels was the capital of two distinct states: Belgium and the CFS, which were only linked together by the figure of King L\u00e9opold II. Thus we scrutinize and discuss at length the reactions of both the Belgian officials and the Congolese administration. The Casement Report as a whole can be read as a travelogue. Casement wrote down his experiences and the personal testimonies of the people he met on his journey. And contrary to popular belief, the Casement Report is not a passionate denunciation of the CFS but rather a well-balanced one. Casement was not, in other words, denouncing at all costs. As Louis explains, the report is \u201cnot a verbally scathing denunciation of the Congo administration,\u201d but rather, it is \u201cunderstated.\u201d Finesse and nuance characterize Casement\u2019s approach. He recognizes the benefits of the Belgian presence on Congolese soil\u2014for instance, in the field of infrastructure\u2014and shares his concerns about the treatment of the indigenous population. The consul was horrified at the drastic depopulation of some areas, which he interpreted either as the outbreak of sleeping sickness, frequent in an African context, or the result of heavy migration to the French Congo. Casement describes the forced labor at the different concessionaries, including Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anversoise and Anglo-Belgian India Rubber company (hencefore Abir), and gives a precise description of the tax system that enslaved the population. In that particular context, he tells the story of a teenage boy, Epondo, who was missing a left hand. The boy\u2019s explanation was that his hand was cut off by a sentry, a Congolese auxiliary employed by the concessionary. Casement personally investigated his case and sent the sentry before the authorities. Casement had, of course, no way of assessing the accuracy of Epondo\u2019s testimony, an issue that will be used against him in later stages. Nevertheless, the Report remains a mirror to the situation of the CFS in 1903. This paper looks at the role and impact of the Casement Report in Belgium. Its assessment within Belgium will help us to understand the part that it played in the end of the CFS and the development of the Belgian Congo. Ultimately, we wish to complicate the connection between Casement\u2019s report and the end of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo, which up to this point has been overly simplified. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part looks at those reactions immediately following the publication of the report, which range from outright hostility to passionate support for the humanitarian cause. This first part also looks at the official responses from the CFS and the inquiry commission set up by the King, which together constitute the official documents of the debate. Casement\u2019s report then comes back in 1912 when the consul wrote another damning condemnation on his\n\nquestion: What was the result of the shocking revelations in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The shocking revelations in the report led to a range of reactions in Belgium, from outright hostility to passionate support for the humanitarian cause.", "usage": 1129}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Of particular interest are the widely differing reactions to it. The last part of the analysis looks at the reception of the Casement Report at the time of the First World War, a time of propaganda and mythical representations. At this time, Belgians had yet another take on the Casement Report. The anti-Congo campaigns were relentless at this point, pushing Belgian citizens to support the King and to deny the atrocities that had taken place. In addition Casement had been hanged for treason by the British. These two factors combined led to a complete disavowal of the Report. I. Edmund Morel\u2019s Campaign and the Casement Report (1903-1904) The name of Roger Casement and the anti-Congo campaigns are inextricably linked. While being a document among many others condemning King L\u00e9opold\u2019s kingdom, Casement\u2019s report remains a touchstone in anti-Congo campaigns. The intensity of the reactions to the report can only be understood by looking at the context of the creation of the CFS and what it stood for. In his burning ambitions of expanding abroad, L\u00e9opold II did not have the support of the financial and political elites of the country. The different parliamentary majorities saw in this expansion project the endangerment of Belgium\u2019s neutrality, and/or a real danger for Belgium\u2019s neutrality. For the liberals, the immediate priority was to keep good relations with neighboring countries, mainly for the development of the economy. In opposition, the socialists denounced the exploitation of the masses both in the industries and in the colonies. And Belgium\u2019s catholic government of the time, while it did not want to get involved in the Congo question, welcomed the idea of establishing catholic missions abroad. Faced with such opposition, L\u00e9opold II decided to act as an individual. In 1870, the King took up the argument of the civilizing mission. His reputation as a philanthropist had been consistently growing both in Belgium and abroad. The King\u2019s humanitarian interest found echo in the Anglophone world that was thoroughly involved with the abolitionist cause. In other words, the civilizing mission had truly become the leitmotiv of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. For this reason, among others, the CFS would be under the gaze of international public opinion. At the outset, L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan was to operate without imposing customs or import duties. While this option proved to be positive for the creation of the CFS, financially it was untenable\u2014so untenable, in fact, that the King was forced to invest his own finances into the CFS. Debts kept growing and, on the verge of bankruptcy, the King decided to drastically change the economic policy of the CFS. Gone were the days of barter with the local population. Emphasis was now on the harvesting of goods, more specifically rubber and ivory. But this new system also led to the use of violence: the military force now came into play to make sure that the demands of harvesting were met. And with the use of the military force came a plethora of violent acts and atrocities, including rape, murder, and mutilation. The atrocities linked to the rubber trade were then not a sought-out politic of L\u00e9opold II, but rather an indirect consequence of his economic position. In 1895, a campaign\u2014in The Times, among others\u2014denounced the abuse in the CFS. Hearing of these allegations, the Belgian King promised changes and reforms and, in that way, managed to keep the reputation of the CFS intact\u2014that is, until the arrival on the scene of Edmund Morel. Hired by Sir Alfred Jones, business partner of L\u00e9opold II, Morel used his pen to defend the cause of ship-owners in Liverpool. As a clerk for the company Morel noticed that the ships leaving Belgium for the Congo carried guns, chains, and explosives but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the CFS came back full of valuable products such as rubber and ivory. This discovery led him to understand the exploitative nature of the regime. To defend the welfare of Africans, Morel launched his own newspaper\u2014The West African Mail\u2014to denounce the brutal exploitation of the natives. This new publication immediately drew the attention of the CFS. The association of Jones and Morel later fuelled the Belgian fantasy that claimed the merchants of Liverpool were plotting against the country. Morel played an important role in the adoption\u2014by the House of Commons on May 20, 1903\u2014of a motion suggested by British Liberal M.P. Herbert Samuel on the Congo question. Samuel\u2019s motion, based on humanitarian and economic arguments, hoped to reconvene the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference\u2014including Belgium\u2014to discuss once again the Congolese question. In Belgium, the\n\nquestion: What was the result of the shocking revelations in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "complete disavowal of the Report.", "usage": 1107}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  motion created a form of awkwardness and embarrassment, but not much more. Only Emile Vandervelde, emblematic figure of the socialist movement, and Georges Lorand, a liberal progressive politician, made a stand against the scandal that erupted in the CFS. The socialist deputy suggested to Paul de Favereau, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to intervene in order to shed light on the alleged atrocities. This proposal, however, was rejected on the grounds that Belgium cannot intervene in the affairs of another sovereign State. The very few reactions to this British motion reflected the disengagement that Belgium felt towards the Congo question. L\u00e9opold II did not wish to see the Congolese question placed on the agenda of European governments. The King, in a state of denial about the atrocities, considered these allegations as lies to serve a campaign of covetousness of the CFS by the \u201ccorsaire\u201d Morel, part of an attempt of the British to get their hands on the Congo Free State. The King then launched his own counter-propaganda. One of his first initiatives was to encourage the creation of the FEDIBE (La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration pour la Defense des Inter\u00eats Belges \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tranger) and that of its official organ, La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur le Congo. The drafting of these texts were naturally provided by the Congolese administration. Blamed for mistreatment towards the Congolese people, the King planned another initiative: the enactment of a law in October 1903 limiting the mandatory services of the indigenous people to around forty hours of work per month. Finally, the CFS answered the British motion in contemptuous terms suggesting that it was a plot organized by the merchants of Liverpool. The Congolese government did not suspect at this stage that Casement was authorized in September 1902 to make a journey to the Upper Congo. Early in 1903, Casement already gave a report on the inequalities of the system in place within the CFS. In May, he was appointed official investigator, and the Foreign Office, aware of the parliamentary debates on the Congo question, encouraged him to leave on his journey as soon as possible. On June 5, the Consul left Matadi. He followed the river and passed through L\u00e9opoldville (Kinshasa) and Coquilhatville (Mbandaka), two major cities in the CFS, but he also abandoned his river path to penetrate deeper into the African country. He spent three weeks at Lake Matumba (la Ntomba) that is located in the Domaine de la Couronne, personal property of King L\u00e9opold II. He also stayed for five days in Bongandanga, the ABIR station, on the Lopori River. This last week was crucial to Casement, as he thought he had collected enough material for his report. On September 11, he began his journey back to the Lower Congo and left the African continent to return to Europe on November 7th to begin his report. II. Belgian Reactions to the Casement Report a.1903-1906: The Casement Report and its Responses 1.December 1903\u2014Mid-March 1904: The Casement Report The British consul finalized Casement\u2019s report in December 1903, and it was published in February of the following year. The first official reactions were dated two months prior to the publication of the report. They were full of worry, fear, and suspicion. Pending the publication of the report, L\u00e9opold II threatened to reorient his policy to be closer to Germany. The King desperately wanted his hands on the report, and he sent Sir Alfred Jones, his associate in maritime affairs and consul of the CFS in Liverpool, twice to the Foreign Office to get an exclusive copy of it. In this atmosphere of great suspicion about England\u2019s ulterior motives in this report, the Count of Lalaing, who was Belgian ambassador in London, tried his best to reassure the governmental spheres that the English posed no threat to the Congo. To that end, Lalaing repeated the words of Lord Lansdowne that Britain did not wish to own any part of the CFS. And, upon sending the Casement Report to Brussels, Lalaing shared a confidence qualifying the Report\u2019s tone as fairly moderate. Of course, great was the ambassador\u2019s disappointment when the British press blatantly attacked the Congo and presented it on its front page news as hell on earth. In spite of these setbacks, the Belgian ambassador continued to work towards some form of appeasement between the various parties. During a dinner at Buckingham, for instance, he had a discussion with the Duke of Argyll, Edward VII\u2019s brother-in-law, who ultimately listened attentively to his claims. However, the relationship between the two ruling houses had, according to Edward VII, deteriorated, and it was not part of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan to improve\n\nquestion: What was the result of the shocking revelations in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The King planned to limit the mandatory services of indigenous people.", "usage": 1118}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  it. The King had become, as his close collaborators reveal, rather bitter in his later years, and it had become impossible for him to bear any contradiction. King L\u00e9opold\u2019s response to the Casement Report was vindictive. He warned the signatory members that the response of the CFS to the Casement Report would shed light on these allegations and establish the very circumstances reported by the British consul. His personal conviction was that \u201cles attaques exag\u00e9r\u00e9es de M. Casement contre les agents Congolais\u201d justified the word \u201clibel\u201d used by the Belgian consul in Liverpool, Edouard S\u00e8ve. Reprimanded by Foreign Affairs, S\u00e8ve\u2019s attitude was illustrative of the zeal of certain diplomats who wanted to get noticed by the Royal Palace, diplomats such as Charles Sarol\u00e9a, who directly opposed Morel. By contrast, Sir Alfred Jones adopted a rather different attitude towards the problem and strongly recommended avoiding controversy in relation to the Casement Report. Jones nevertheless remained extremely active in the Congo question and hired a number of people who, under the safe umbrella of neutrality, started conducting a number of counter-investigations. One of these people is Lord Mountmorres, an Irish peer who officially worked for the London journal, The Globe. The Irishman sent a report to the Foreign Office that he later published in book form. In his conclusion, Mountmorres made a case in favor of the Congolese administration. The CFS, he argued, was governed humanely. The blame of these atrocities, he continued in his report, fell on the greedy concessionaries. The CFS did not bear, therefore, more responsibility than any other colonial regime. The Belgian press\u2014except for the socialists\u2014mirrored these official concerns. Except for Le Peuple, most press organizations were highly critical of the Casement Report. Most of their reports were filled with downright hostility. The papers emphasized the only positive point in the report: that of the very much-improved state of the infrastructure and the abolishment of the slave trade. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle stressed \u201cl\u2019\u00e9nergie montr\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s belges\u201d to improve what they called, one of the wildest regions in Africa. The rest of their reports discredited both the man himself and his report. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge saw the report as having \u201cun caract\u00e8re tendencieux,\u201d mainly because Casement\u2019s trip lasted two months only, instead of the six that were officially planned. For the liberal paper, L\u00e9opold II accomplished \u201cune \u0153uvre de civilisation et de progr\u00e8s \u00e0 laquelle nulle autre n\u2019est comparable dans l\u2019ordre colonial.\u201d Le Soir, in an article dating back to December 1903, stated that Casement\u2019s work just amounted to \u201cune campagne de d\u00e9nigrement vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019Etat ind\u00e9pendant.\u201d Casement\u2019s findings relating to cruelty and oppression were directly discredited by referring to the counter-investigation carried out in the immediate aftermath of the publication by Marquis Bosco, judge in the CFS. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, compared Casement\u2019s and Bosco\u2019s findings, arguing in favor of the latter. According to the paper, while the English accused the Europeans of cruelty on the Congolese, Bosco demonstrated that these alleged cases of mutilation dated back more than ten years and therefore could not be the responsibility of Europeans. The discourse around British covetousness of the Congo imbued the newspaper articles. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, spoke of \u201cparti pris dans les affaires du Congo.\u201d Le Peuple was the only newspaper of those we examined that had another perspective on the Casement Report. The socialist paper presented the findings as facts \u201cdont l\u2019horreur fait fr\u00e9mir\u201d and wrote of \u201ccaoutchouc rouge.\u201d Le Peuple showed its true opposition to the system in the CFS after the publication of the inquiry commission. Reactions to the Casement Report were diverse in 1903. Except for Le Peuple, which stood for equal chances for all, the rest of these reactions\u2014both official and popular\u2014were shown to be quite distrustful of the report, often deeming it an exaggeration or a ploy to reconvene the Berlin Conference and discuss the Congo case. Words like \u201cexaggeration,\u201d \u201csuspicion,\u201d \u201cmistrust,\u201d \u201cBritish covetousness\u201d and \u201chorror\u201d were used to decry what Casement witnessed in and\n\nquestion: What was the result of the shocking revelations in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Diverse reactions were shown to be quite distrustful of the report, often deeming it an exaggeration or a ploy to reconvene the Berlin Conference and discuss the Congo case.", "usage": 1079}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It definitely led to passionate reactions among the Belgians, some feeling outrage at what they saw as an attack, and others feeling consternation at the treatment of the native population whom, according to the Berlin Conference, the Europeans were supposed to protect. 2.Mid-March 1904\u2014March 1905: Congo Free State Response The CFS gave its official response to the Casement Report on March 12, 1904. The suggestion made by the Congo Free State to conduct a private investigation into Casement\u2019s allegations\u2014just as Joseph Chamberlain had promised for the Fiji Islands\u2014caught the attention of the Foreign Office. This response, and its idea to launch a private investigation, was well-received by the Foreign Office. Francis Villiers, future British ambassador in Brussels, strongly recommended that this inquiry be led by an international commission. Bound by its statement, the Congo Free State sent three commissioners\u2014a Belgian, an Italian, and a Swiss\u2014to assess the situation in the country between October 1904 and February 1905. Neither Casement nor Morel believed in the efficiency of this commission, whose members were, in some form or other, connected to the King. The findings of the international commission were rather more nuanced than Casement\u2019s report. On the whole, it confirmed that atrocities were being committed on Congolese soil but presented the facts with their grey areas. They clearly established that the Epondo case was an exaggeration, a testimony that Casement failed to verify. The findings also suggested possible explanations for the type of behavior exhibited in the Congo (for example, climate, lack of morals, abuse of power, pressure for results). In general, their findings could be considered as more rational and nuanced than those of the Casement Report. In this period immediately following the Congo Free State response, each paper kept the stance that they had established towards the Casement Report. The Catholic and Liberal press emphasized the arguments that offered a more favorable vision of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. Both Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge published the report and were hoping that the response by the CFS would clear up \u201cun malentendu\u201d created by \u201cdes \u00e9l\u00e9ments anglais.\u201d Commenting upon the atrocities, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge wrote that these, which were at first considered as \u201cincontestables,\u201d had now been shown to be refutable. The paper illustrated its claims by means of two examples. First it discussed at length the well-known Epondo case, once the symbol of the oppression of the system and now simply the victim of a hunting accident. And second, in a later article, the paper discussed another mistake made by Casement. Casement had seen a dozen Congolese men travelling in a train carriage from L\u00e9opoldville to Matadi. They were tied up and controlled under the watchful eye of a soldier, leading the consul to believe they were involved in the rubber scandal. In point of fact, these people were a group of men condemned by the Court in Basoko who had come to Matadi to serve their sentence. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge confirmed its full support to the regime in the CFS and expressed its strong disagreement with the idea that the Congo administration led to \u201cun r\u00e9gime syst\u00e9matique de cruaut\u00e9s ou d\u2019oppression.\u201d The paper, nevertheless, acknowledged that some wrongdoings happened in the country, just as they had in any other colony. But then the paper immediately suggested a number of possible suggestions for these acts of cruelty. It argued that when such deeds had been committed, the perpetrators had been severely punished. It then advised its readers to bear in mind the difficulties Belgians had to face in the heart of Africa, a country with more than two hundred languages and where roads had yet to be built. According to L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, the English should have thought \u201caux difficult\u00e9s qui assaillent les officiers au Congo.\u201d It would be easy to condemn, wrote the paper, when \u201con est assis chez soi \u00e0 l\u2019abri du besoin.\u201d The English, therefore, should give some thought \u201c\u00e0 la mentalit\u00e9 de ces hommes bris\u00e9s de corps et d\u2019esprit dans une lutte perp\u00e9tuelle.\u201d Le Soir wrote a number of articles that defended the country against the Casement Report. In its issue of June 30, 1904, the newspaper interviewed Paul Landbeck, an official working in the CFS. Landbeck strongly contested all the allegations of the British consul against the Free State. His view was that the series of atrocities outlined by Casement were carried out fifteen or twenty years ago before the government stepped in to establish law and order. He put the responsibility\n\nquestion: What was the result of the shocking revelations in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The findings suggested possible explanations for the type of behavior in the Congo.", "usage": 1093}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He believed it \u201cimpossible\u201d that the hands were cut off by Europeans. Landbeck further argued that ill-treatment of the natives was severely punished in the CFS, and that there was no exploitation of the natives to collect rubber. There reigns in the Congo, according to the interviewee, \u201cun ordre parfait.\u201d His view was that \u201cl\u2019Etat remplit sa mission.\u201d The Belgian press continued to establish links between the Casement Report and English covetousness of the Congo. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge believed that the English started their anti-Congo campaigns at the time when the Free State was becoming an extremely prosperous state. The paper held the view that the English blamed the atrocities on the Congo administration with an ulterior motive, that of getting their hands on the Free State: A partir de 1895, le commerce de l\u2019Etat du Congo prend un essor marqu\u00e9, et le chiffre des exportations monte progressivement de 10 millions en 1895 \u00e0 50 millions en 1902. C\u2019est aussi \u00e0 partir d\u2019alors que le mouvement contre l\u2019Etat du Congo se dessine. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que l\u2019Etat affirmera davantage sa vitalit\u00e9 et ses progr\u00e8s, la campagne ira en s\u2019accentuant, s\u2019appuyant sur quelques cas particuliers et isol\u00e9s pour invoquer des pr\u00e9textes d\u2019humanit\u00e9 et dissimuler le v\u00e9ritable objectif des convoitises qui, dans leur impatience, se sont cependant trahies sous la plume des pamphl\u00e9taires et par la voix de membres de la Chambre des communes, mettant nettement en avant la disparition et le partage de l\u2019Etat du Congo. Le Peuple, however, faithful to its belief in a better treatment for all, continued to fight to expose the atrocities. It disagreed with the response by the Congo Free State and sided with Casement and English views on the issue. In June 1904, Le Peuple, to show its support to Casement, quoted at length three other sources in Sir Charles Dilke, English liberal politician, Sir John Garot, and Count Earl Percy, the British Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Dilke claimed that the Congo Free State was \u201cun enfer sur terre.\u201d Sir John Garot followed suit and argued that the country was \u201cune immense cuve dans laquelle fermentent les atrocit\u00e9s, les oppressions et les cruaut\u00e9s.\u201d The positions established in 1903-1904 continued in the same line of thought. Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle supported the response by the Congo Free State, relieving Belgium from blame in these allegations. The argument of British covetousness gathered momentum as the anti-Congo campaigns continued. Emile Vandervelde and Le Peuple, on the other hand, siding with the Casement Report, were still fighting for the defense of the native population in the Free State. Their campaign to expose the atrocities in the Congo Free State took its full measure in the next phase, in the response to the report of the inquiry commission. 3.March 1905 - November 1905: The Commission Report The inquiry commission came back in March 1905 from the Free State and its report was published in November 1905. Because it was published in the Bulletin Officiel, the official journal of the Congo Free State, this report was not accessible to the masses, but rather to a small minority of learned and interested people invested in the Congo question. In addition to the report\u2019s relative lack of visibility, the celebrations for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Belgian independence stirred up dormant patriotic feelings in Belgium. The two major political parties\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014touted the King\u2019s genius. The politicians were aware that an impressive program of embellishment and aggrandizement of Belgium had been made possible thanks to the Congo. The socialist leader, again bravely challenged the government about the atrocities against the native population but, just like in 1903, his concerns fell on deaf ears. The Congo question was compared by Lorand to the Dreyfus case in France. It had become impossible, according to the Liberal deputy, to treat the Congo question without being accused of treason towards Belgium or of collusion with the merchants of Liverpool. It was therefore of no surprise that these\n\nquestion: What was the result of the shocking revelations in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1064}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle corroborated the commission report, and, in their respective newspapers, primarily printed those findings of the commission that could speak for themselves. One newspaper, however, stood out. Le Peuple showed the full measure of its opposition to the Congo system. While Vandervelde\u2019s voice was not heard in the parliamentary debates, he expressed his views in his socialist newspaper. The socialist leader and his newspaper summarized and quoted the Casement Report in the hope of exposing the cruel system of oppression. They called for a \u201ccampagne de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de piti\u00e9.\u201d The paper focused largely on Abir. The argument against the atrocities was all the more striking since Casement\u2019s findings relating to those concessionaries like Abir were confirmed in the commission report. Le Peuple made a point at presenting in detail the atrocities inflicted on the population to collect the rubber. Le Peuple printed the testimony of victims who came to testify in front of the international commission. They heard the stories of families being taken hostage by Abir because the men did not fill their quota of rubber; they were told about the armed sentries threatening the rubber carriers; they heard the stories of horrific corporal punishment, including floggings and lashes with a chicotte against those that did not fulfill their quotas. The paper described \u201cles civilisateurs Congolais\u201d as follows: On tuait sans distinction les femmes inoffensives et les enfants  Tout cela apparemment pour frapper de terreur ce malheureux peuple et le forcer \u00e0 apporter du caoutchouc  Les t\u00e9moins racont\u00e8rent qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient constamment battus avec la chicotte et que leurs femmes et leurs enfants \u00e9taient continuellement emprisonn\u00e9s, beaucoup de gens mourant soit en prison, soit imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9s. Pendant que les hommes dans la for\u00eat r\u00e9coltaient le caoutchouc, leurs femmes \u00e9taient outrag\u00e9es, maltrait\u00e9es ou enlev\u00e9es par les sentinelles  L\u2019histoire de l\u2019ABIR dans ces r\u00e9gions-ci est une histoire d\u2019oppression, de sang vers\u00e9 et d\u2019iniquit\u00e9. Il lui sera bien difficile d\u2019expier ses torts envers la population. This work of vulgarization and spreading of the Casement Report continued until 1906 when two major works vulgarized the commission report and thereby made it available to a much wider audience. The first of these major works was by liberal F\u00e9licien Cattier, Professor at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles; the other was by Father Vermeersch, a Jesuit. Interestingly, the vulgarization of the report came from two political strands\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014that were at the time staunch supporters of the Congo Free State. Father Vermeersch\u2019s book introduced catholic opinion to the possibility that the anti-Congo campaigns were not simply an attack against the Free State by Protestant missionaries. The annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium soon became a most viable solution. The proposal of annexation was taken so seriously that, led by Vandervelde, the debates were reopened on the Congo question in February 1906. Cattier\u2019s book and the commission report became the touchstones to start reforming the regime of the Congo Free State. During the discussion on the annexation of the Congo, references to Casement were rare, just as were those to Morel. A few days before the annexation in October 1908, Vandervelde once again emphasized the importance of the consul in this thorny issue. b.1910-1914: The Casement Report and the Putumayo Atrocities After his report on the CFS, Casement served as consul in various parts of the world, including Lisbon, the Brazilian port of Santos, followed by S\u00e3o Paulo, at the mouth of the Amazon. In July 1910, Edward Grey insisted that Casement be attached to a commission going to investigate reports of atrocities on the Putumayo River of the upper Amazon. What Casement found there was another oppressive regime. Agents of this regime, reported Casement, administrated inhumane treatment on the native population. Back in Britain, in January 1911, Casement submitted his detailed and damning report to the Foreign Secretary. The British government decided in July 1912 to publish Casement\u2019s report. It was subsequently published in the Belgian\n\nquestion: What was the result of the shocking revelations in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The shocking revelations in the report led to the eventual annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium.", "usage": 1065}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Through the lens of the Putumayo Report, new light is shed on a number of interesting remarks on the Casement Report. When the Putumayo Report was commented on in Belgium in July 1912, the status of the CFS had evolved. The annexation of the Congo in 1908 as a colony of Belgium, known as the Belgian Congo, along with the King\u2019s death in 1909, had changed the situation completely. Belgium put L\u00e9opold II on a pedestal and the episode of the red rubber was erased from people\u2019s memory. A striking example of this change in perception is the case of Emile Vandervelde: the man who exposed and condemned the atrocities of the Congo during the Parliamentary debates and in heated and passionate articles in Le Peuple became, after his trip to the Congo, a fervent supporter of the colony. His policies now connected socialism and colonialism by arguing that both these movements had the moral obligation of guardianship towards the less developed people. The socialist leader then distanced himself from Morel\u2019s campaign. From the Belgian perspective, however, the Putumayo Report fell at a bad time. In 1910-12, when the Congo Free State became the Belgian Congo, its new colonial administration reacted rather poorly to the allegations about the inability of the Belgians to rule the Congo. For the authorities of the newly-created Belgian Congo, England froze interference by pursuing its consular inquiries into the Congo. Through a fear either imagined or real, the Congo remained for the Belgian authorities a coveted colony. Important discussions were taking place between Lalaing and Grey regarding the recognition by the English of the annexation of the Congo Free State to Belgium. When Casement returned from Putumayo, Count Lalaing highlighted the similar attitude that London adopted towards the Congo Free State and the Peruvian government.  Upon publication of the Putumayo Report, the British press made allusions to the Congo case and stirred up ancient feuds between the two countries. The ambassador very much regretted that the press made \u201callusions aussi blessantes qu\u2019exag\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ancien r\u00e9gime Congolais.\u201d  If The Times mentioned that the situation was worse in Peru, Morel insisted in The Economist that nothing could be compared to the CFS. The annexation was finally recognized the following year, and Grey\u2019s speech on that occasion was welcomed by L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the clearing of reckless attacks. In contrast, the Belgian government deemed that England was much too slow in her recognition of the Belgian Congo. If Lalaing highlighted similar reactions on the part of London towards both of Casement reports, the press adopted a totally different stance to Casement\u2019s Putumayo Report. There were no connections established in the papers about the fact that both reports were from the same pen. The press treated these two reports as totally distinct. Another striking difference was that, while the Casement Report was passionately debated and condemned as false (apart from a few) between 1903 and 1906, the Putumayo Report was presented in a detached manner, very matter-of-factly. The reports in Le Soir and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle took the form of factual lists of atrocities committed by the Peruvian Amazon Company on the indigenous population to collect rubber in all their excruciating details. The comparison of the treatment established two important facts: the first one was that there was indeed a complete amnesia in Belgium about the Congo atrocities. Not one reference was made to Casement, the damned and criticized author of the report on the CFS. And secondly, the difference in treatments highlighted the fact that, between 1903 and 1906, there was a passionate debate about the Congo question. The Casement Report, contrary to what Jules Marchal argues, did trigger interest and passionate debate among the Belgian population. c.1914-1918: The Casement Report and the Great War At the time of the outbreak of the Great War, Casement was retired. This retirement, however, was rather short lived. He turned his interest to Ireland\u2019s political turmoil. In 1914 Ireland, different political factions opposed each other on the issue of Home Rule, which would grant a Dublin government for the whole of Ireland. Unionists opposed the bill because they feared a loss of power; constitutional nationalists and John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, supported the Home Rule bill. To put actions into words, he urged Irishmen to enlist in the British army. Within the nationalists, there was a more radical Republican wing that included well-known names such as Patrick Pearse, Thomas Clarke, Sean McDermott, and\u2026Roger Casement. The former British consul had decided to fight alongside the republicans in the hope of the birth of an independent Ireland, free and not part of any Empire. Casement sought to obtain German support for a rebellion against English rule\u2014the Easter Rising. Shortly before\n\nquestion: What was the result of the shocking revelations in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1110}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was convicted and executed for treason. Casement\u2019s involvement in these republican activities ultimately had a profound effect on the perspective of the Casement Report within Belgium. There were very few official responses to Casement\u2019s fate. Casement\u2019s involvement in the Easter Rising and his subsequent arrest were barely mentioned by the Belgian embassy in London. The Belgian Congo\u2019s mother country was deemed at this time \u201cpoor little Belgium,\u201d a country that the British needed to rescue after the German invasion of its territory. Despite the laudatory speeches and gestures of support, King Albert and the Belgian government were deeply concerned by the German occupation of Belgium and by the possible damage to the integrity of the national territory both of Belgium and of the Belgian Congo after the conflict. In this time of great crisis for Belgium, Casement\u2019s trial was not an object of interest for Belgian officials. Instead of going back to ancient feuds, the ambassador, Paul Hymans, worked towards the organization of two Anglo-Belgian events that would demonstrate the intimate friendship between the two countries. Success was complete, and Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, in his speeches, glorified the Belgian attitude. By coincidence, the two events took place shortly before and after Casement\u2019s execution on August 3, 1916. Then, too, the execution of the former consul was not exploited by Belgian officials. Hymans\u2019 personality played a big role in that fact. Following the publication of Morel\u2019s Truth and the War at the end of August, part of the public opinion\u2014including British\u2014was struck by the coincidence between Morel\u2019s statements in 1911, in which he advocated for an Anglo-German rapprochement on the basis of the sharing of the Congo, and the revelations at Casement\u2019s trial. From there emerged the idea that Morel and Casement were agents in the service of Germany, whose aim it was to create tensions between Belgium and Great Britain on the Congo question. This development, however, was rejected by the ambassador, who trusted history to decide on the issue. However, three important elements reversed the situation completely: first, the creation of a propaganda division at the ministry of the colonies in 1916; second, Morel\u2019s condemnation in 1917; and third, the need to look victimized at the peace conference. Now Minister of Foreign affairs, Hymans signed a note for the diplomats, prepared by Octave Louwers. If Louwers, as a young magistrate in the Congo Free State, denounced L\u00e9opold II as a scoundrel, the minister\u2019s adviser suggested not to be intimidated by the memory of the \u201catrocities,\u201d because if L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime had not been faultless, its benefits were too long overshadowed by the accusations orchestrated by questionable characters. Sir Herbert Samuel, author of the motion in May 1903, bowed a quarter of a century later in front of the Belgian work that was now at the forefront of progressive and enlightened colonial administrations. The myth that Morel and Casement were agents of Germany resurged throughout the whole period of the Belgian Congo. While there were very few references to Casement\u2019s fate in the official spheres, the press, on the other hand, turned the Casement\u2019s trial and his hanging into its main headlines. Casement was, in the Belgian press, a \u201ctra\u00eetre.\u201d Le Soir, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge reported Casement\u2019s arrest in every detail, branding him as \u201cIrlando-Boche,\u201d \u201cun agent de l\u2019Allemagne\u201d, and \u201cinventeur et le colporteur de l\u2019abominable l\u00e9gende des \u2018mains coup\u00e9es\u2019.\u201d With an ironic twist, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle asked \u201co\u00f9 sont ces belles d\u00e9clamations sur les atrocit\u00e9s congolaise, sur le \u2018caoutchouc rouge,\u2019 les vibrantes tirades humanitaires?\u201d The journalist compared Casement to a character in a Charles Dickens novel: Il y a dans un roman de Dickens une brave dame qui passe son temps \u00e0 s\u2019occuper des indig\u00e8nes de Borrisbola-Ghaa sur la c\u00f4te d\u2019Afrique\u2014mais qui oublie totalement l\u2019existence de son mari et de ses enfants. Le sieur Casement rappelle cette bonne femme, avec l\u2019infamie en plus. Casement\u2019s friendship with Germany was outlined in every article. Le Soir told Casement\u2019s story from the\n\nquestion: What was the result of the shocking revelations in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1036}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The latter was in favor of Casement\u2019s suggestion to build an army from Irish prisoners of war to fight for the Irish cause. Casement\u2019s treason threw into doubt all the allegations that he made in 1903 on the Belgian administration of the CFS. In light of these events, the Casement Report was completely nullified by the Belgian society of the Great War. Casement\u2019s alignment with Germany was, to the papers, further proof that this man was not to be trusted and that his report was just a pack of lies. In Le Soir, for instance, dating back to April 1916, Casement\u2019s report was fully discredited: \u201cLa plupart des horribles \u00e9pisodes racont\u00e9s par cet \u00e9trange consul \u00e9taient exag\u00e9r\u00e9s et en partie invent\u00e9s  Il \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 ma\u00eetre dans l\u2019art de truquer les photographies et de falsifier les documents.\u201d British attitudes completely changed with regards to the Casement Report. The British that had proclaimed for all the world to hear the atrocities that were taking place in the Belgian Congo now apologized for being \u201cduped\u201d by the traitor Casement. Le Soir reported that the British press expressed \u201cun vif regret d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 entrain\u00e9e par ce tra\u00eetre.\u201d Casement\u2019s report was now being perceived a tool to create a gap between Belgium and England for the benefit of Germany. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle wrote passionately about this particular issue: Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de brouiller la Belgique et l\u2019Angleterre, et, par surcroit la France et l\u2019Angleterre? Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats politiques de l\u2019Allemagne, int\u00e9r\u00eats continentaux et int\u00e9r\u00eats coloniaux compris? Il est grand temps que la r\u00e9putation de la Belgique \u2018calomni\u00e9e\u2019 dans cette affaire, soit enfin r\u00e9habilit\u00e9e. In the light of these events, Belgian papers presented the Belgian Congo colony as being coveted by Germany. Le Soir, for one, wrote that \u201cMorel et Casement  travaillaient \u00e0 d\u00e9pouiller la Belgique de sa colonie, au profit de l\u2019Allemagne.\u201d All in all Casement\u2019s treason was, for Belgium and the Belgian Congo, holy bread. L\u00e9opold II and his humanitarian work in the Congo was now restored to good faith. L\u00e9opold II got his revenge, and the Belgian Congo, former Congo Free State, was reestablished among the model colonies in Africa. L\u00e9opold\u2019s \u0153uvre was \u201cveng\u00e9e des accusations du tra\u00eetre Casement,\u201d  wrote Le Soir. For those living in 1905 and 1906, when L\u00e9opold II was \u201cl\u2019objet d\u2019inf\u00e2mes outrages dans la presse \u00e9trang\u00e8re,\u201d these revelations were \u201cune \u00e9clatante revanche et une grande consolation.\u201d \u201cQuelle revanche,\u201d wrote Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, \u201cpour L\u00e9opold II et nos h\u00e9ros africains que les campagnes des complices de la barbarie allemande avaient r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire passer, m\u00eame aux yeux de certains de leurs compatriotes, pour de monstrueux criminels.\u201d III. Conclusion Roger Casement\u2019s report and the end of the CFS are considered today to be intrinsically connected to one another, the former leading to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo. This connection, however, as this paper hopes to have shown, is much more in the realm of myth than it is of actual historical reality. The direct link that exists in popular imagination between the report and the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo is a simplification of the role and impact of Casement\u2019s denunciatory report. Casement\u2019s report is first and foremost the work of an emphatic man who wished to denounce the suffering of the Congolese population. In Great Britain and the Anglophone world as a whole, the report had a great impact upon both the political and popular spheres of the country. Such an impact can be understood within the recurrent charges of maladministration that took place on L\u00e9opold\u2019s territory since 1895. Casement\u2019s report kindled the spark to this fire of\n\nquestion: What was the result of the shocking revelations in the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Casement Report was completely nullified by the Belgian society of the Great War.

In Belgium, however, the role and impact of the Casement Report was of a totally different nature. Political opinions oscillated between rejection of the report and support for its humanitarian concerns. Belgian socialists and liberals never hesitated in condemning the abuse taking place in the CFS, while the catholics cast a great shadow over the truth and veracity of Casement\u2019s statements. The use of a foreign report, however, was not acceptable within Belgian politics and an enquiry commission was established. The debate, therefore, was not on the basis of Casement\u2019s report, but rather on that of the enquiry commission. The Casement Report was but a piece in the domino effect that led to the annexation of the Congo to Belgium. Even after the annexation, the relentless attack upon L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo awakened Belgium\u2019s national pride. As a reaction there was a phenomenon of collective amnesia concerning the abuse, and L\u00e9opold II was put on a pedestal. The outbreak of the First World War resuscitated the figure of Roger Casement in yet another perspective. The Great War was a time of propaganda where partial truths are turned into patriotic dogmas. With the growing feeling of Belgian national pride, the country framed itself sympathetically with the hanging of Roger Casement by the British authorities for treason. The papers once again insisted on Casement\u2019s report as a pack of lies intended to steal the Congo away from Belgium. Today still, former Belgian colonials look upon Casement\u2019s report as exaggerated and his campaign as mainly anti-Belgian. In the end, the anti-Congo campaign created a dualistic representation of the CFS, one that has been taken up in literature by Adam Hochschild and Mario Vargas Llosa, both of whom represent Casement as the martyr of the humanitarian cause. This image of Casement as a martyr cannot be applied to Roger Casement, who was, and will always remain, a privileged witness of L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo.

This is when the movement against the Congo Free State started to emerge. As the State asserted more and more its vitality and progress, the campaign will keep on growing, relying on some specific and isolated cases to invoke humanity as a pretext to conceal the true objective of their envy.

This report was instrumental in Leopold finally relinquishing his private holdings in Africa. Leopold had held ownership of the Congolese state since 1885, granted to him by the Berlin Conference, in which he exploited its natural resources (mostly rubber) for his own private wealth. Through intercepted letters, Captain Hubert-Joseph Lothaire, the commander of the Congo Free State forces in the Ituri-campaign, learned that Charles Stokes (born in Dublin) was on his way from German East Africa to sell weapons to the Zanzibari slavers in the eastern Congo region. Stokes was arrested and taken to Captain Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a Drumhead court-martial. Stokes was found guilty of selling guns, gunpowder and detonators to the Congo Free State's Afro-Arab enemies. On 14 January 1895 he was sentenced to death and was hanged the next day (hoisted on a tree). To Lothaire, Charles Stokes was no more than a criminal whose hanging was fully justified. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister at the time, commented that if Stokes was in league with Arab slave-trading, then 'he deserved hanging'. Sir John Kirk, for years the British Consul in Zanzibar, remarked that \"he was no loss to us, although he was an honest man.\" The news of Stokes' execution was received with indifference by the British Foreign Office. When the German ambassador asked Sir Thomas H. Sanderson, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether the British government planned to take any steps regarding the execution of this \"well-known character\", Sanderson wrote: \"I do not quite understand why the Germans are pressing us.\" In August 1895, the attention of the British press was drawn to this case by Lionel Decle, a journalist for the Pall Mall Gazette. The press began to report on these events in great detail, The Daily News emphasized 'bloodthirsty precipitation', The Times a 'painful and disgraceful death', The Liverpool Daily Post 'horrified amazement through the British race', The Daily Telegraph 'death like a dog', adding, \"Have we all been wrong in believing that the most audacious foreigner \u2013 not to speak of any savage chief \u2013 would think once, twice and even trice, before he laid hands on a subject of Queen Victoria?\". As a result, the case became an international incident, better known as the Stokes Affair. Together, Britain and Germany pressured the Congo Free State to put Lothaire on trial, which they eventually did, a first trial was held in the city of Boma. The Free State paid compensation to the British (150,000 francs) and Germans (100,000 francs) and made it impossible by decree to impose martial law or death sentences on European citizens. Stokes's body was returned to his family. Lothaire was acquitted twice, first in April 1896 by a tribunal in Boma. In August 1896, the appeal was confirmed in Brussels by the Supreme Court of Congo, paving the way for the rehabilitation of Lothaire. The Stokes Affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State. It also damaged the reputation of King Leopold II of Belgium as a benevolent despot, which he had cultivated with so much effort. The case helped encourage the foundation of the Congo Reform Association \u2013 by Roger Casement and E. D. Morel \u2013 which in its turn put pressure on the Belgian government, which helped lead to the annexation of the Congo Free State by the Belgian state in 1908. For many years prior to the Casement Report there were reports from the Congo alleging widespread abuses and exploitation of the native population. In 1895, the situation was reported to Dr Henry Grattan Guinness (1861\u20131915), a missionary doctor. He had established the Congo-Balolo Mission in 1889, and was promised action by King Leopold later in 1895, but nothing changed. H. R. Fox-Bourne of the Aborigines' Protection Society had published Civilisation in Congoland in 1903, and the journalist E. D. Morel also wrote several articles about the Leopoldian government's behaviour in the Congo Free State. On 20 May 1903 a motion by the Liberal Herbert Samuel was debated in the British House of Commons, resulting in this resolution:... That the Government of the Congo Free State having, at its inception, guaranteed to the Powers that its Native subjects should be governed with humanity, and that no trading monopoly or privilege should be permitted within its dominions, this House requests His Majesty's Government to confer with the other Powers, signatories of the Berlin General Act by virtue of which the Congo\n\nquestion: What was the impact of the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Casement Report led to the annexation of the Congo Free State by the Belgian state.", "usage": 1154}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Subsequently, the British consul at Boma in the Congo, the Irishman Roger Casement was instructed by Balfour's government to investigate. His report was published in 1904, confirmed Morel's accusations, and had a considerable impact on public opinion. Casement met and became friends with Morel just before the publication of his report in 1904 and realized that he had found the ally he had sought. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organization for dealing specifically with the Congo question. With Casement's and Dr. Guinness's assistance, he set up and ran the Congo Reform Association, which worked to end Leopold's control of the Congo Free State. Branches of the association were established as far away as the United States. The Casement Report comprises forty pages of the Parliamentary Papers, to which is appended another twenty pages of individual statements gathered by Casement as Consul, including several detailing grim tales of killings, mutilations, kidnappings and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo Administration of King Leopold. Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1885, under which much of Africa had been partitioned. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. While the Report was issued as a Command paper in 1904, and was laid before the Houses of Parliament, the original was not published in full until 1985, in an annotated book by two Belgian professors of the history of colonialism. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist political leader and statesman Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold II to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives). Despite these findings, Leopold managed to retain personal control of the Congo until 1908, when the Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration as the Belgian Congo. However the final push came from Leopold's successor King Albert I, and in 1912 the Congo Reform Association had the satisfaction of dissolving itself.\n\nquestion: What was the impact of the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The report confirmed Morel's accusations and had a considerable impact on public opinion.", "usage": 636}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The report publicly denounced the atrocious systems of the rubber terror which forced Africans to extract the rubber from lianas to the profit of the State or concessionaries. Published in Great Britain in 1904, the report caused great outrage. The impact of the report in Belgium, however, has been so far underexplored. William Roger Louis mentions the importance of this report to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime and to Belgium\u2019s takeover of the Congo. This position, however, is contested by Jules Marchal, who has stated in his work that \u201cthe king had not to fear a reaction from the Belgian public who showed little interest in the Congo.\u201d None of these studies, however, have looked in depth at the impact of the publication of the Casement Report on the official reactions and on popular opinion in Belgium. This paper seeks to do just that. Keywords Roger Casement, King L\u00e9opold II, Congo Free State, Casement Report, Belgian Congo, Belgium, Commission of Inquiry, anti-Congo campaigns Introduction In July 1903, Roger Casement, as part of his duties as British consul, set out on a journey to the rubber regions of the Congo Free State (henceforth \u201cCFS\u201d). In February 1904, the publication of his report on the harsh living conditions of the indigenous population aroused much indignation within official and popular spheres in Great Britain. Very quickly, Casement and Edmund Morel founded the Congo Reform Association (henceforth \u201cC.R.A\u201d) and proclaimed their goal of putting an end to King L\u00e9opold II\u2019s Congo. And thus started one of the first humanitarian campaigns, one which, in spite of the end of the Congo Free State and its annexation to Belgium in 1908, continued its efforts until 1913. In the wake of the publication of the report in Great Britain, two very different courses of action were put in place. The first was official: the governmental spheres aimed at keeping the balance among European nations and expressing courtesy towards allied countries. The second course of action concerned public opinion: the C.R.A stepped up their propaganda against the CFS in order to stir the hearts of the British people into action. The role of the Casement Report was very different in each case. Officially, Great Britain used it in the hopes of reopening the Congo question with the signatories of the Berlin Conference. For the British people, the Report was certainly the trigger for the creation of the C.R.A but was also quickly replaced both by testimonies, primarily of Protestant missionaries, and by Morel\u2019s multiple books and pamphlets on the ill-treatment of the indigenous population. If studies on Casement\u2019s life and actions are manifold, the analysis of the reception of Casement\u2019s report and its impact in Belgium are important and, yet, relatively neglected research areas. In addition, the passing remarks on the subject are largely contradictory. William Roger Louis argues that the report was a major factor in the end of the CFS: \u201cCasement\u2019s report and his establishment of the C.R.A.,\u201d writes Louis, \u201cwere two feats that contributed greatly to the eventual downfall of the Leopoldian system, and the annexation of the Congo by Belgium.\u201d Jules Marchal, however, expresses the opinion that, because the Belgian population showed \u201clittle interest in the Congo,\u201d its impact was de-facto insignificant. In his contribution, he nevertheless recognizes that the real impact of the Casement Report and its role in the end of the CFS can only be really understood and evaluated by looking at the official and popular spheres within Belgium itself. It is true that the Congolese question was, first and foremost, an issue within Belgian domestic political affairs. Since 1890, Belgium was heir to L\u00e9opold II; and, since 1901, the Belgian Parliament could have started the annexation procedure of the Congo Free State to Belgium, had it wished to do so. Internationally, too, this right was never questioned either by England or by the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference. If the anti-Congo campaign led by the C.R.A. is still remembered elsewhere today, in Belgium itself, it had very little impact, and this is for two main reasons: first, while Casement and Morel\u2019s campaign was a pressurizing factor in Great Britain, it was much less so in Belgium. And second, in a very practical sense, the working language of the report was English, which was at that time not particularly well-known in Belgium. And yet, by criticizing the CFS, Casement and Morel were attacking the King, something that did not leave the\n\nquestion: What was the impact of the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The report led to the eventual downfall of the Leopoldian system and the annexation of the Congo by Belgium.", "usage": 1103}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since its independence in 1830, Belgium has had a constitutional monarchy. The country has a rather liberal constitution, affording many freedoms to its citizens. One of its articles guarantees the freedom of press and stipulates that censorship can never be established, thereby engendering a quasi-absolute freedom of the press. Belgian society at the time of L\u00e9opold II was organized into different segments, each with their own ideology. There were three pillars at that time: catholic, liberal, and socialist. Each pillar had its own social institutions, including distinct political parties and newspapers. For each of these pillars, the chosen mouthpiece was the press. Political parties and newspapers were so tied up together that it was not uncommon to find parliamentarians, party leaders, and ministers as writers or newspaper editors. For example, the leader of the socialist party, Emile Vandervelde, was one of the columnists for Le Peuple; and the leader of the catholic party, Charles Woeste, was the editor-in-chief of La Revue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Circulation was good, given that about 68% of the population was literate in 1900. For these reasons, we believe that the press is an excellent indicator of the popular opinions of each of the different pillars towards the Casement Report, the anti-Congo campaigns, and the annexation of Congo to Belgium. For this article, we have chosen Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle as the representative of the catholic pillar, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the liberal mouthpiece, and Le Peuple as the expression of the socialist viewpoint. We have also included in the corpus Le Soir which defines itself as a neutral paper. Those press publications subsidized by the CFS such as La Belgique coloniale, L\u2019Etoile belge, and Le Petit Bleu have not been included in this study because their influence was not great on Belgian popular opinion. The debate on the CFS is not limited to popular reactions, and therefore we also consider the official reactions. At the time of the debate Brussels was the capital of two distinct states: Belgium and the CFS, which were only linked together by the figure of King L\u00e9opold II. Thus we scrutinize and discuss at length the reactions of both the Belgian officials and the Congolese administration. The Casement Report as a whole can be read as a travelogue. Casement wrote down his experiences and the personal testimonies of the people he met on his journey. And contrary to popular belief, the Casement Report is not a passionate denunciation of the CFS but rather a well-balanced one. Casement was not, in other words, denouncing at all costs. As Louis explains, the report is \u201cnot a verbally scathing denunciation of the Congo administration,\u201d but rather, it is \u201cunderstated.\u201d Finesse and nuance characterize Casement\u2019s approach. He recognizes the benefits of the Belgian presence on Congolese soil\u2014for instance, in the field of infrastructure\u2014and shares his concerns about the treatment of the indigenous population. The consul was horrified at the drastic depopulation of some areas, which he interpreted either as the outbreak of sleeping sickness, frequent in an African context, or the result of heavy migration to the French Congo. Casement describes the forced labor at the different concessionaries, including Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anversoise and Anglo-Belgian India Rubber company (hencefore Abir), and gives a precise description of the tax system that enslaved the population. In that particular context, he tells the story of a teenage boy, Epondo, who was missing a left hand. The boy\u2019s explanation was that his hand was cut off by a sentry, a Congolese auxiliary employed by the concessionary. Casement personally investigated his case and sent the sentry before the authorities. Casement had, of course, no way of assessing the accuracy of Epondo\u2019s testimony, an issue that will be used against him in later stages. Nevertheless, the Report remains a mirror to the situation of the CFS in 1903. This paper looks at the role and impact of the Casement Report in Belgium. Its assessment within Belgium will help us to understand the part that it played in the end of the CFS and the development of the Belgian Congo. Ultimately, we wish to complicate the connection between Casement\u2019s report and the end of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo, which up to this point has been overly simplified. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part looks at those reactions immediately following the publication of the report, which range from outright hostility to passionate support for the humanitarian cause. This first part also looks at the official responses from the CFS and the inquiry commission set up by the King, which together constitute the official documents of the debate. Casement\u2019s report then comes back in 1912 when the consul wrote another damning condemnation on his\n\nquestion: What was the impact of the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The report led to a range of reactions, including outright hostility and passionate support for the humanitarian cause.", "usage": 1119}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Of particular interest are the widely differing reactions to it. The last part of the analysis looks at the reception of the Casement Report at the time of the First World War, a time of propaganda and mythical representations. At this time, Belgians had yet another take on the Casement Report. The anti-Congo campaigns were relentless at this point, pushing Belgian citizens to support the King and to deny the atrocities that had taken place. In addition Casement had been hanged for treason by the British. These two factors combined led to a complete disavowal of the Report. I. Edmund Morel\u2019s Campaign and the Casement Report (1903-1904) The name of Roger Casement and the anti-Congo campaigns are inextricably linked. While being a document among many others condemning King L\u00e9opold\u2019s kingdom, Casement\u2019s report remains a touchstone in anti-Congo campaigns. The intensity of the reactions to the report can only be understood by looking at the context of the creation of the CFS and what it stood for. In his burning ambitions of expanding abroad, L\u00e9opold II did not have the support of the financial and political elites of the country. The different parliamentary majorities saw in this expansion project the endangerment of Belgium\u2019s neutrality, and/or a real danger for Belgium\u2019s neutrality. For the liberals, the immediate priority was to keep good relations with neighboring countries, mainly for the development of the economy. In opposition, the socialists denounced the exploitation of the masses both in the industries and in the colonies. And Belgium\u2019s catholic government of the time, while it did not want to get involved in the Congo question, welcomed the idea of establishing catholic missions abroad. Faced with such opposition, L\u00e9opold II decided to act as an individual. In 1870, the King took up the argument of the civilizing mission. His reputation as a philanthropist had been consistently growing both in Belgium and abroad. The King\u2019s humanitarian interest found echo in the Anglophone world that was thoroughly involved with the abolitionist cause. In other words, the civilizing mission had truly become the leitmotiv of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. For this reason, among others, the CFS would be under the gaze of international public opinion. At the outset, L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan was to operate without imposing customs or import duties. While this option proved to be positive for the creation of the CFS, financially it was untenable\u2014so untenable, in fact, that the King was forced to invest his own finances into the CFS. Debts kept growing and, on the verge of bankruptcy, the King decided to drastically change the economic policy of the CFS. Gone were the days of barter with the local population. Emphasis was now on the harvesting of goods, more specifically rubber and ivory. But this new system also led to the use of violence: the military force now came into play to make sure that the demands of harvesting were met. And with the use of the military force came a plethora of violent acts and atrocities, including rape, murder, and mutilation. The atrocities linked to the rubber trade were then not a sought-out politic of L\u00e9opold II, but rather an indirect consequence of his economic position. In 1895, a campaign\u2014in The Times, among others\u2014denounced the abuse in the CFS. Hearing of these allegations, the Belgian King promised changes and reforms and, in that way, managed to keep the reputation of the CFS intact\u2014that is, until the arrival on the scene of Edmund Morel. Hired by Sir Alfred Jones, business partner of L\u00e9opold II, Morel used his pen to defend the cause of ship-owners in Liverpool. As a clerk for the company Morel noticed that the ships leaving Belgium for the Congo carried guns, chains, and explosives but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the CFS came back full of valuable products such as rubber and ivory. This discovery led him to understand the exploitative nature of the regime. To defend the welfare of Africans, Morel launched his own newspaper\u2014The West African Mail\u2014to denounce the brutal exploitation of the natives. This new publication immediately drew the attention of the CFS. The association of Jones and Morel later fuelled the Belgian fantasy that claimed the merchants of Liverpool were plotting against the country. Morel played an important role in the adoption\u2014by the House of Commons on May 20, 1903\u2014of a motion suggested by British Liberal M.P. Herbert Samuel on the Congo question. Samuel\u2019s motion, based on humanitarian and economic arguments, hoped to reconvene the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference\u2014including Belgium\u2014to discuss once again the Congolese question. In Belgium, the\n\nquestion: What was the impact of the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The reception of the Casement Report led to complete disavowal of the Report and denial of the atrocities that had taken place.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  motion created a form of awkwardness and embarrassment, but not much more. Only Emile Vandervelde, emblematic figure of the socialist movement, and Georges Lorand, a liberal progressive politician, made a stand against the scandal that erupted in the CFS. The socialist deputy suggested to Paul de Favereau, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to intervene in order to shed light on the alleged atrocities. This proposal, however, was rejected on the grounds that Belgium cannot intervene in the affairs of another sovereign State. The very few reactions to this British motion reflected the disengagement that Belgium felt towards the Congo question. L\u00e9opold II did not wish to see the Congolese question placed on the agenda of European governments. The King, in a state of denial about the atrocities, considered these allegations as lies to serve a campaign of covetousness of the CFS by the \u201ccorsaire\u201d Morel, part of an attempt of the British to get their hands on the Congo Free State. The King then launched his own counter-propaganda. One of his first initiatives was to encourage the creation of the FEDIBE (La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration pour la Defense des Inter\u00eats Belges \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tranger) and that of its official organ, La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur le Congo. The drafting of these texts were naturally provided by the Congolese administration. Blamed for mistreatment towards the Congolese people, the King planned another initiative: the enactment of a law in October 1903 limiting the mandatory services of the indigenous people to around forty hours of work per month. Finally, the CFS answered the British motion in contemptuous terms suggesting that it was a plot organized by the merchants of Liverpool. The Congolese government did not suspect at this stage that Casement was authorized in September 1902 to make a journey to the Upper Congo. Early in 1903, Casement already gave a report on the inequalities of the system in place within the CFS. In May, he was appointed official investigator, and the Foreign Office, aware of the parliamentary debates on the Congo question, encouraged him to leave on his journey as soon as possible. On June 5, the Consul left Matadi. He followed the river and passed through L\u00e9opoldville (Kinshasa) and Coquilhatville (Mbandaka), two major cities in the CFS, but he also abandoned his river path to penetrate deeper into the African country. He spent three weeks at Lake Matumba (la Ntomba) that is located in the Domaine de la Couronne, personal property of King L\u00e9opold II. He also stayed for five days in Bongandanga, the ABIR station, on the Lopori River. This last week was crucial to Casement, as he thought he had collected enough material for his report. On September 11, he began his journey back to the Lower Congo and left the African continent to return to Europe on November 7th to begin his report. II. Belgian Reactions to the Casement Report a.1903-1906: The Casement Report and its Responses 1.December 1903\u2014Mid-March 1904: The Casement Report The British consul finalized Casement\u2019s report in December 1903, and it was published in February of the following year. The first official reactions were dated two months prior to the publication of the report. They were full of worry, fear, and suspicion. Pending the publication of the report, L\u00e9opold II threatened to reorient his policy to be closer to Germany. The King desperately wanted his hands on the report, and he sent Sir Alfred Jones, his associate in maritime affairs and consul of the CFS in Liverpool, twice to the Foreign Office to get an exclusive copy of it. In this atmosphere of great suspicion about England\u2019s ulterior motives in this report, the Count of Lalaing, who was Belgian ambassador in London, tried his best to reassure the governmental spheres that the English posed no threat to the Congo. To that end, Lalaing repeated the words of Lord Lansdowne that Britain did not wish to own any part of the CFS. And, upon sending the Casement Report to Brussels, Lalaing shared a confidence qualifying the Report\u2019s tone as fairly moderate. Of course, great was the ambassador\u2019s disappointment when the British press blatantly attacked the Congo and presented it on its front page news as hell on earth. In spite of these setbacks, the Belgian ambassador continued to work towards some form of appeasement between the various parties. During a dinner at Buckingham, for instance, he had a discussion with the Duke of Argyll, Edward VII\u2019s brother-in-law, who ultimately listened attentively to his claims. However, the relationship between the two ruling houses had, according to Edward VII, deteriorated, and it was not part of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan to improve\n\nquestion: What was the impact of the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Serve a campaign of covetousness of the CFS by the \u201ccorsaire\u201d Morel.", "usage": 1123}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  it. The King had become, as his close collaborators reveal, rather bitter in his later years, and it had become impossible for him to bear any contradiction. King L\u00e9opold\u2019s response to the Casement Report was vindictive. He warned the signatory members that the response of the CFS to the Casement Report would shed light on these allegations and establish the very circumstances reported by the British consul. His personal conviction was that \u201cles attaques exag\u00e9r\u00e9es de M. Casement contre les agents Congolais\u201d justified the word \u201clibel\u201d used by the Belgian consul in Liverpool, Edouard S\u00e8ve. Reprimanded by Foreign Affairs, S\u00e8ve\u2019s attitude was illustrative of the zeal of certain diplomats who wanted to get noticed by the Royal Palace, diplomats such as Charles Sarol\u00e9a, who directly opposed Morel. By contrast, Sir Alfred Jones adopted a rather different attitude towards the problem and strongly recommended avoiding controversy in relation to the Casement Report. Jones nevertheless remained extremely active in the Congo question and hired a number of people who, under the safe umbrella of neutrality, started conducting a number of counter-investigations. One of these people is Lord Mountmorres, an Irish peer who officially worked for the London journal, The Globe. The Irishman sent a report to the Foreign Office that he later published in book form. In his conclusion, Mountmorres made a case in favor of the Congolese administration. The CFS, he argued, was governed humanely. The blame of these atrocities, he continued in his report, fell on the greedy concessionaries. The CFS did not bear, therefore, more responsibility than any other colonial regime. The Belgian press\u2014except for the socialists\u2014mirrored these official concerns. Except for Le Peuple, most press organizations were highly critical of the Casement Report. Most of their reports were filled with downright hostility. The papers emphasized the only positive point in the report: that of the very much-improved state of the infrastructure and the abolishment of the slave trade. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle stressed \u201cl\u2019\u00e9nergie montr\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s belges\u201d to improve what they called, one of the wildest regions in Africa. The rest of their reports discredited both the man himself and his report. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge saw the report as having \u201cun caract\u00e8re tendencieux,\u201d mainly because Casement\u2019s trip lasted two months only, instead of the six that were officially planned. For the liberal paper, L\u00e9opold II accomplished \u201cune \u0153uvre de civilisation et de progr\u00e8s \u00e0 laquelle nulle autre n\u2019est comparable dans l\u2019ordre colonial.\u201d Le Soir, in an article dating back to December 1903, stated that Casement\u2019s work just amounted to \u201cune campagne de d\u00e9nigrement vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019Etat ind\u00e9pendant.\u201d Casement\u2019s findings relating to cruelty and oppression were directly discredited by referring to the counter-investigation carried out in the immediate aftermath of the publication by Marquis Bosco, judge in the CFS. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, compared Casement\u2019s and Bosco\u2019s findings, arguing in favor of the latter. According to the paper, while the English accused the Europeans of cruelty on the Congolese, Bosco demonstrated that these alleged cases of mutilation dated back more than ten years and therefore could not be the responsibility of Europeans. The discourse around British covetousness of the Congo imbued the newspaper articles. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, spoke of \u201cparti pris dans les affaires du Congo.\u201d Le Peuple was the only newspaper of those we examined that had another perspective on the Casement Report. The socialist paper presented the findings as facts \u201cdont l\u2019horreur fait fr\u00e9mir\u201d and wrote of \u201ccaoutchouc rouge.\u201d Le Peuple showed its true opposition to the system in the CFS after the publication of the inquiry commission. Reactions to the Casement Report were diverse in 1903. Except for Le Peuple, which stood for equal chances for all, the rest of these reactions\u2014both official and popular\u2014were shown to be quite distrustful of the report, often deeming it an exaggeration or a ploy to reconvene the Berlin Conference and discuss the Congo case. Words like \u201cexaggeration,\u201d \u201csuspicion,\u201d \u201cmistrust,\u201d \u201cBritish covetousness\u201d and \u201chorror\u201d were used to decry what Casement witnessed in and\n\nquestion: What was the impact of the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Most of these reactions were shown to be quite distrustful of the report, often deeming it an exaggeration or a ploy to reconvene the Berlin Conference and discuss the Congo case.", "usage": 1076}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It definitely led to passionate reactions among the Belgians, some feeling outrage at what they saw as an attack, and others feeling consternation at the treatment of the native population whom, according to the Berlin Conference, the Europeans were supposed to protect. 2.Mid-March 1904\u2014March 1905: Congo Free State Response The CFS gave its official response to the Casement Report on March 12, 1904. The suggestion made by the Congo Free State to conduct a private investigation into Casement\u2019s allegations\u2014just as Joseph Chamberlain had promised for the Fiji Islands\u2014caught the attention of the Foreign Office. This response, and its idea to launch a private investigation, was well-received by the Foreign Office. Francis Villiers, future British ambassador in Brussels, strongly recommended that this inquiry be led by an international commission. Bound by its statement, the Congo Free State sent three commissioners\u2014a Belgian, an Italian, and a Swiss\u2014to assess the situation in the country between October 1904 and February 1905. Neither Casement nor Morel believed in the efficiency of this commission, whose members were, in some form or other, connected to the King. The findings of the international commission were rather more nuanced than Casement\u2019s report. On the whole, it confirmed that atrocities were being committed on Congolese soil but presented the facts with their grey areas. They clearly established that the Epondo case was an exaggeration, a testimony that Casement failed to verify. The findings also suggested possible explanations for the type of behavior exhibited in the Congo (for example, climate, lack of morals, abuse of power, pressure for results). In general, their findings could be considered as more rational and nuanced than those of the Casement Report. In this period immediately following the Congo Free State response, each paper kept the stance that they had established towards the Casement Report. The Catholic and Liberal press emphasized the arguments that offered a more favorable vision of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. Both Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge published the report and were hoping that the response by the CFS would clear up \u201cun malentendu\u201d created by \u201cdes \u00e9l\u00e9ments anglais.\u201d Commenting upon the atrocities, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge wrote that these, which were at first considered as \u201cincontestables,\u201d had now been shown to be refutable. The paper illustrated its claims by means of two examples. First it discussed at length the well-known Epondo case, once the symbol of the oppression of the system and now simply the victim of a hunting accident. And second, in a later article, the paper discussed another mistake made by Casement. Casement had seen a dozen Congolese men travelling in a train carriage from L\u00e9opoldville to Matadi. They were tied up and controlled under the watchful eye of a soldier, leading the consul to believe they were involved in the rubber scandal. In point of fact, these people were a group of men condemned by the Court in Basoko who had come to Matadi to serve their sentence. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge confirmed its full support to the regime in the CFS and expressed its strong disagreement with the idea that the Congo administration led to \u201cun r\u00e9gime syst\u00e9matique de cruaut\u00e9s ou d\u2019oppression.\u201d The paper, nevertheless, acknowledged that some wrongdoings happened in the country, just as they had in any other colony. But then the paper immediately suggested a number of possible suggestions for these acts of cruelty. It argued that when such deeds had been committed, the perpetrators had been severely punished. It then advised its readers to bear in mind the difficulties Belgians had to face in the heart of Africa, a country with more than two hundred languages and where roads had yet to be built.

In its issue of June 30, 1904, the newspaper interviewed Paul Landbeck, an official working in the CFS. Landbeck strongly contested all the allegations of the British consul against the Free State. His view was that the series of atrocities outlined by Casement were carried out fifteen or twenty years ago before the government stepped in to establish law and order.

He believed it \u201cimpossible\u201d that the hands were cut off by Europeans. Landbeck further argued that ill-treatment of the natives was severely punished in the CFS, and that there was no exploitation of the natives to collect rubber. There reigns in the Congo, according to the interviewee, \u201cun ordre parfait.\u201d His view was that \u201cl\u2019Etat remplit sa mission.\u201d The Belgian press continued to establish links between the Casement Report and English covetousness of the Congo. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge believed that the English started their anti-Congo campaigns at the time when the Free State was becoming an extremely prosperous state. The paper held the view that the English blamed the atrocities on the Congo administration with an ulterior motive, that of getting their hands on the Free State: A partir de 1895, le commerce de l\u2019Etat du Congo prend un essor marqu\u00e9, et le chiffre des exportations monte progressivement de 10 millions en 1895 \u00e0 50 millions en 1902. C\u2019est aussi \u00e0 partir d\u2019alors que le mouvement contre l\u2019Etat du Congo se dessine. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que l\u2019Etat affirmera davantage sa vitalit\u00e9 et ses progr\u00e8s, la campagne ira en s\u2019accentuant, s\u2019appuyant sur quelques cas particuliers et isol\u00e9s pour invoquer des pr\u00e9textes d\u2019humanit\u00e9 et dissimuler le v\u00e9ritable objectif des convoitises qui, dans leur impatience, se sont cependant trahies sous la plume des pamphl\u00e9taires et par la voix de membres de la Chambre des communes, mettant nettement en avant la disparition et le partage de l\u2019Etat du Congo. Le Peuple, however, faithful to its belief in a better treatment for all, continued to fight to expose the atrocities. It disagreed with the response by the Congo Free State and sided with Casement and English views on the issue. In June 1904, Le Peuple, to show its support to Casement, quoted at length three other sources in Sir Charles Dilke, English liberal politician, Sir John Garot, and Count Earl Percy, the British Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Dilke claimed that the Congo Free State was \u201cun enfer sur terre.\u201d Sir John Garot followed suit and argued that the country was \u201cune immense cuve dans laquelle fermentent les atrocit\u00e9s, les oppressions et les cruaut\u00e9s.\u201d The positions established in 1903-1904 continued in the same line of thought. Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle supported the response by the Congo Free State, relieving Belgium from blame in these allegations. The argument of British covetousness gathered momentum as the anti-Congo campaigns continued. Emile Vandervelde and Le Peuple, on the other hand, siding with the Casement Report, were still fighting for the defense of the native population in the Free State. Their campaign to expose the atrocities in the Congo Free State took its full measure in the next phase, in the response to the report of the inquiry commission. 3.March 1905 - November 1905: The Commission Report The inquiry commission came back in March 1905 from the Free State and its report was published in November 1905. Because it was published in the Bulletin Officiel, the official journal of the Congo Free State, this report was not accessible to the masses, but rather to a small minority of learned and interested people invested in the Congo question. In addition to the report\u2019s relative lack of visibility, the celebrations for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Belgian independence stirred up dormant patriotic feelings in Belgium. The two major political parties\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014touted the King\u2019s genius. The politicians were aware that an impressive program of embellishment and aggrandizement of Belgium had been made possible thanks to the Congo. The socialist leader, again bravely challenged the government about the atrocities against the native population but, just like in 1903, his concerns fell on deaf ears. The Congo question was compared by Lorand to the Dreyfus case in France. It had become impossible, according to the Liberal deputy, to treat the Congo question without being accused of treason towards Belgium or of collusion with the merchants of Liverpool. It was therefore of no surprise that these\n\nquestion: What was the impact of the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The impact of the report was that the Belgian press continued to establish links between the Casement Report and English covetousness of the Congo.", "usage": 1087}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle corroborated the commission report, and, in their respective newspapers, primarily printed those findings of the commission that could speak for themselves. One newspaper, however, stood out. Le Peuple showed the full measure of its opposition to the Congo system. While Vandervelde\u2019s voice was not heard in the parliamentary debates, he expressed his views in his socialist newspaper. The socialist leader and his newspaper summarized and quoted the Casement Report in the hope of exposing the cruel system of oppression. They called for a \u201ccampagne de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de piti\u00e9.\u201d The paper focused largely on Abir. The argument against the atrocities was all the more striking since Casement\u2019s findings relating to those concessionaries like Abir were confirmed in the commission report. Le Peuple made a point at presenting in detail the atrocities inflicted on the population to collect the rubber. Le Peuple printed the testimony of victims who came to testify in front of the international commission. They heard the stories of families being taken hostage by Abir because the men did not fill their quota of rubber; they were told about the armed sentries threatening the rubber carriers; they heard the stories of horrific corporal punishment, including floggings and lashes with a chicotte against those that did not fulfill their quotas. The paper described \u201cles civilisateurs Congolais\u201d as follows: On tuait sans distinction les femmes inoffensives et les enfants  Tout cela apparemment pour frapper de terreur ce malheureux peuple et le forcer \u00e0 apporter du caoutchouc  Les t\u00e9moins racont\u00e8rent qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient constamment battus avec la chicotte et que leurs femmes et leurs enfants \u00e9taient continuellement emprisonn\u00e9s, beaucoup de gens mourant soit en prison, soit imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9s. Pendant que les hommes dans la for\u00eat r\u00e9coltaient le caoutchouc, leurs femmes \u00e9taient outrag\u00e9es, maltrait\u00e9es ou enlev\u00e9es par les sentinelles  L\u2019histoire de l\u2019ABIR dans ces r\u00e9gions-ci est une histoire d\u2019oppression, de sang vers\u00e9 et d\u2019iniquit\u00e9. Il lui sera bien difficile d\u2019expier ses torts envers la population. This work of vulgarization and spreading of the Casement Report continued until 1906 when two major works vulgarized the commission report and thereby made it available to a much wider audience. The first of these major works was by liberal F\u00e9licien Cattier, Professor at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles; the other was by Father Vermeersch, a Jesuit. Interestingly, the vulgarization of the report came from two political strands\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014that were at the time staunch supporters of the Congo Free State. Father Vermeersch\u2019s book introduced catholic opinion to the possibility that the anti-Congo campaigns were not simply an attack against the Free State by Protestant missionaries. The annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium soon became a most viable solution. The proposal of annexation was taken so seriously that, led by Vandervelde, the debates were reopened on the Congo question in February 1906. Cattier\u2019s book and the commission report became the touchstones to start reforming the regime of the Congo Free State. During the discussion on the annexation of the Congo, references to Casement were rare, just as were those to Morel. A few days before the annexation in October 1908, Vandervelde once again emphasized the importance of the consul in this thorny issue. b.1910-1914: The Casement Report and the Putumayo Atrocities After his report on the CFS, Casement served as consul in various parts of the world, including Lisbon, the Brazilian port of Santos, followed by S\u00e3o Paulo, at the mouth of the Amazon. In July 1910, Edward Grey insisted that Casement be attached to a commission going to investigate reports of atrocities on the Putumayo River of the upper Amazon. What Casement found there was another oppressive regime. Agents of this regime, reported Casement, administrated inhumane treatment on the native population. Back in Britain, in January 1911, Casement submitted his detailed and damning report to the Foreign Secretary. The British government decided in July 1912 to publish Casement\u2019s report. It was subsequently published in the Belgian\n\nquestion: What was the impact of the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The report led to the proposal of annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium and became the touchstones to start reforming the regime of the Congo Free State.", "usage": 1074}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Through the lens of the Putumayo Report, new light is shed on a number of interesting remarks on the Casement Report. When the Putumayo Report was commented on in Belgium in July 1912, the status of the CFS had evolved. The annexation of the Congo in 1908 as a colony of Belgium, known as the Belgian Congo, along with the King\u2019s death in 1909, had changed the situation completely. Belgium put L\u00e9opold II on a pedestal and the episode of the red rubber was erased from people\u2019s memory. A striking example of this change in perception is the case of Emile Vandervelde: the man who exposed and condemned the atrocities of the Congo during the Parliamentary debates and in heated and passionate articles in Le Peuple became, after his trip to the Congo, a fervent supporter of the colony. His policies now connected socialism and colonialism by arguing that both these movements had the moral obligation of guardianship towards the less developed people. The socialist leader then distanced himself from Morel\u2019s campaign. From the Belgian perspective, however, the Putumayo Report fell at a bad time. In 1910-12, when the Congo Free State became the Belgian Congo, its new colonial administration reacted rather poorly to the allegations about the inability of the Belgians to rule the Congo. For the authorities of the newly-created Belgian Congo, England froze interference by pursuing its consular inquiries into the Congo. Through a fear either imagined or real, the Congo remained for the Belgian authorities a coveted colony. Important discussions were taking place between Lalaing and Grey regarding the recognition by the English of the annexation of the Congo Free State to Belgium. When Casement returned from Putumayo, Count Lalaing highlighted the similar attitude that London adopted towards the Congo Free State and the Peruvian government.  Upon publication of the Putumayo Report, the British press made allusions to the Congo case and stirred up ancient feuds between the two countries. The ambassador very much regretted that the press made \u201callusions aussi blessantes qu\u2019exag\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ancien r\u00e9gime Congolais.\u201d  If The Times mentioned that the situation was worse in Peru, Morel insisted in The Economist that nothing could be compared to the CFS. The annexation was finally recognized the following year, and Grey\u2019s speech on that occasion was welcomed by L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the clearing of reckless attacks. In contrast, the Belgian government deemed that England was much too slow in her recognition of the Belgian Congo. If Lalaing highlighted similar reactions on the part of London towards both of Casement reports, the press adopted a totally different stance to Casement\u2019s Putumayo Report. There were no connections established in the papers about the fact that both reports were from the same pen. The press treated these two reports as totally distinct. Another striking difference was that, while the Casement Report was passionately debated and condemned as false (apart from a few) between 1903 and 1906, the Putumayo Report was presented in a detached manner, very matter-of-factly. The reports in Le Soir and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle took the form of factual lists of atrocities committed by the Peruvian Amazon Company on the indigenous population to collect rubber in all their excruciating details. The comparison of the treatment established two important facts: the first one was that there was indeed a complete amnesia in Belgium about the Congo atrocities. Not one reference was made to Casement, the damned and criticized author of the report on the CFS. And secondly, the difference in treatments highlighted the fact that, between 1903 and 1906, there was a passionate debate about the Congo question. The Casement Report, contrary to what Jules Marchal argues, did trigger interest and passionate debate among the Belgian population. c.1914-1918: The Casement Report and the Great War At the time of the outbreak of the Great War, Casement was retired. This retirement, however, was rather short lived. He turned his interest to Ireland\u2019s political turmoil. In 1914 Ireland, different political factions opposed each other on the issue of Home Rule, which would grant a Dublin government for the whole of Ireland. Unionists opposed the bill because they feared a loss of power; constitutional nationalists and John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, supported the Home Rule bill. To put actions into words, he urged Irishmen to enlist in the British army. Within the nationalists, there was a more radical Republican wing that included well-known names such as Patrick Pearse, Thomas Clarke, Sean McDermott, and\u2026Roger Casement. The former British consul had decided to fight alongside the republicans in the hope of the birth of an independent Ireland, free and not part of any Empire. Casement sought to obtain German support for a rebellion against English rule\u2014the Easter Rising. Shortly before\n\nquestion: What was the impact of the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1106}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was convicted and executed for treason. Casement\u2019s involvement in these republican activities ultimately had a profound effect on the perspective of the Casement Report within Belgium. There were very few official responses to Casement\u2019s fate. Casement\u2019s involvement in the Easter Rising and his subsequent arrest were barely mentioned by the Belgian embassy in London. The Belgian Congo\u2019s mother country was deemed at this time \u201cpoor little Belgium,\u201d a country that the British needed to rescue after the German invasion of its territory. Despite the laudatory speeches and gestures of support, King Albert and the Belgian government were deeply concerned by the German occupation of Belgium and by the possible damage to the integrity of the national territory both of Belgium and of the Belgian Congo after the conflict. In this time of great crisis for Belgium, Casement\u2019s trial was not an object of interest for Belgian officials. Instead of going back to ancient feuds, the ambassador, Paul Hymans, worked towards the organization of two Anglo-Belgian events that would demonstrate the intimate friendship between the two countries. Success was complete, and Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, in his speeches, glorified the Belgian attitude. By coincidence, the two events took place shortly before and after Casement\u2019s execution on August 3, 1916. Then, too, the execution of the former consul was not exploited by Belgian officials. Hymans\u2019 personality played a big role in that fact. Following the publication of Morel\u2019s Truth and the War at the end of August, part of the public opinion\u2014including British\u2014was struck by the coincidence between Morel\u2019s statements in 1911, in which he advocated for an Anglo-German rapprochement on the basis of the sharing of the Congo, and the revelations at Casement\u2019s trial. From there emerged the idea that Morel and Casement were agents in the service of Germany, whose aim it was to create tensions between Belgium and Great Britain on the Congo question. This development, however, was rejected by the ambassador, who trusted history to decide on the issue. However, three important elements reversed the situation completely: first, the creation of a propaganda division at the ministry of the colonies in 1916; second, Morel\u2019s condemnation in 1917; and third, the need to look victimized at the peace conference. Now Minister of Foreign affairs, Hymans signed a note for the diplomats, prepared by Octave Louwers. If Louwers, as a young magistrate in the Congo Free State, denounced L\u00e9opold II as a scoundrel, the minister\u2019s adviser suggested not to be intimidated by the memory of the \u201catrocities,\u201d because if L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime had not been faultless, its benefits were too long overshadowed by the accusations orchestrated by questionable characters. Sir Herbert Samuel, author of the motion in May 1903, bowed a quarter of a century later in front of the Belgian work that was now at the forefront of progressive and enlightened colonial administrations. The myth that Morel and Casement were agents of Germany resurged throughout the whole period of the Belgian Congo. While there were very few references to Casement\u2019s fate in the official spheres, the press, on the other hand, turned the Casement\u2019s trial and his hanging into its main headlines. Casement was, in the Belgian press, a \u201ctra\u00eetre.\u201d Le Soir, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge reported Casement\u2019s arrest in every detail, branding him as \u201cIrlando-Boche,\u201d \u201cun agent de l\u2019Allemagne\u201d, and \u201cinventeur et le colporteur de l\u2019abominable l\u00e9gende des \u2018mains coup\u00e9es\u2019.\u201d With an ironic twist, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle asked \u201co\u00f9 sont ces belles d\u00e9clamations sur les atrocit\u00e9s congolaise, sur le \u2018caoutchouc rouge,\u2019 les vibrantes tirades humanitaires?\u201d The journalist compared Casement to a character in a Charles Dickens novel: Il y a dans un roman de Dickens une brave dame qui passe son temps \u00e0 s\u2019occuper des indig\u00e8nes de Borrisbola-Ghaa sur la c\u00f4te d\u2019Afrique\u2014mais qui oublie totalement l\u2019existence de son mari et de ses enfants. Le sieur Casement rappelle cette bonne femme, avec l\u2019infamie en plus. Casement\u2019s friendship with Germany was outlined in every article.

The latter was in favor of Casement\u2019s suggestion to build an army from Irish prisoners of war to fight for the Irish cause. Casement\u2019s treason threw into doubt all the allegations that he made in 1903 on the Belgian administration of the CFS. In light of these events, the Casement Report was completely nullified by the Belgian society of the Great War. Casement\u2019s alignment with Germany was, to the papers, further proof that this man was not to be trusted and that his report was just a pack of lies. In Le Soir, for instance, dating back to April 1916, Casement\u2019s report was fully discredited: \u201cLa plupart des horribles \u00e9pisodes racont\u00e9s par cet \u00e9trange consul \u00e9taient exag\u00e9r\u00e9s et en partie invent\u00e9s  Il \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 ma\u00eetre dans l\u2019art de truquer les photographies et de falsifier les documents.\u201d British attitudes completely changed with regards to the Casement Report. The British that had proclaimed for all the world to hear the atrocities that were taking place in the Belgian Congo now apologized for being \u201cduped\u201d by the traitor Casement. Le Soir reported that the British press expressed \u201cun vif regret d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 entrain\u00e9e par ce tra\u00eetre.\u201d Casement\u2019s report was now being perceived a tool to create a gap between Belgium and England for the benefit of Germany. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle wrote passionately about this particular issue: Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de brouiller la Belgique et l\u2019Angleterre, et, par surcroit la France et l\u2019Angleterre? Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats politiques de l\u2019Allemagne, int\u00e9r\u00eats continentaux et int\u00e9r\u00eats coloniaux compris? Il est grand temps que la r\u00e9putation de la Belgique \u2018calomni\u00e9e\u2019 dans cette affaire, soit enfin r\u00e9habilit\u00e9e. In the light of these events, Belgian papers presented the Belgian Congo colony as being coveted by Germany. Le Soir, for one, wrote that \u201cMorel et Casement  travaillaient \u00e0 d\u00e9pouiller la Belgique de sa colonie, au profit de l\u2019Allemagne.\u201d All in all Casement\u2019s treason was, for Belgium and the Belgian Congo, holy bread. L\u00e9opold II and his humanitarian work in the Congo was now restored to good faith. L\u00e9opold II got his revenge, and the Belgian Congo, former Congo Free State, was reestablished among the model colonies in Africa. L\u00e9opold\u2019s \u0153uvre was \u201cveng\u00e9e des accusations du tra\u00eetre Casement,\u201d  wrote Le Soir. For those living in 1905 and 1906, when L\u00e9opold II was \u201cl\u2019objet d\u2019inf\u00e2mes outrages dans la presse \u00e9trang\u00e8re,\u201d these revelations were \u201cune \u00e9clatante revanche et une grande consolation.\u201d \u201cQuelle revanche,\u201d wrote Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, \u201cpour L\u00e9opold II et nos h\u00e9ros africains que les campagnes des complices de la barbarie allemande avaient r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire passer, m\u00eame aux yeux de certains de leurs compatriotes, pour de monstrueux criminels.\u201d III. Conclusion Roger Casement\u2019s report and the end of the CFS are considered today to be intrinsically connected to one another, the former leading to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo. This connection, however, as this paper hopes to have shown, is much more in the realm of myth than it is of actual historical reality. The direct link that exists in popular imagination between the report and the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo is a simplification of the role and impact of Casement\u2019s denunciatory report. Casement\u2019s report is first and foremost the work of an emphatic man who wished to denounce the suffering of the Congolese population. In Great Britain and the Anglophone world as a whole, the report had a great impact upon both the political and popular spheres of the country. Such an impact can be understood within the recurrent charges of maladministration that took place on L\u00e9opold\u2019s territory since 1895. Casement\u2019s report kindled the spark to this fire of\n\nquestion: What was the impact of the report?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The report had a great impact upon both the political and popular spheres of Great Britain and the Anglophone world as a whole.", "usage": 1042}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In Belgium, however, the role and impact of the Casement Report was of a totally different nature. Political opinions oscillated between rejection of the report and support for its humanitarian concerns. Belgian socialists and liberals never hesitated in condemning the abuse taking place in the CFS, while the catholics cast a great shadow over the truth and veracity of Casement\u2019s statements. The use of a foreign report, however, was not acceptable within Belgian politics and an enquiry commission was established. The debate, therefore, was not on the basis of Casement\u2019s report, but rather on that of the enquiry commission. The Casement Report was but a piece in the domino effect that led to the annexation of the Congo to Belgium. Even after the annexation, the relentless attack upon L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo awakened Belgium\u2019s national pride. As a reaction there was a phenomenon of collective amnesia concerning the abuse, and L\u00e9opold II was put on a pedestal. The outbreak of the First World War resuscitated the figure of Roger Casement in yet another perspective. The Great War was a time of propaganda where partial truths are turned into patriotic dogmas. With the growing feeling of Belgian national pride, the country framed itself sympathetically with the hanging of Roger Casement by the British authorities for treason. The papers once again insisted on Casement\u2019s report as a pack of lies intended to steal the Congo away from Belgium. Today still, former Belgian colonials look upon Casement\u2019s report as exaggerated and his campaign as mainly anti-Belgian. In the end, the anti-Congo campaign created a dualistic representation of the CFS, one that has been taken up in literature by Adam Hochschild and Mario Vargas Llosa, both of whom represent Casement as the martyr of the humanitarian cause.

As the State asserted more and more its vitality and progress, the campaign will keep on growing, relying on some specific and isolated cases to invoke humanity as a pretext to conceal the true objective of their envy.

This report was instrumental in Leopold finally relinquishing his private holdings in Africa. Leopold had held ownership of the Congolese state since 1885, granted to him by the Berlin Conference, in which he exploited its natural resources (mostly rubber) for his own private wealth. Through intercepted letters, Captain Hubert-Joseph Lothaire, the commander of the Congo Free State forces in the Ituri-campaign, learned that Charles Stokes (born in Dublin) was on his way from German East Africa to sell weapons to the Zanzibari slavers in the eastern Congo region. Stokes was arrested and taken to Captain Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a Drumhead court-martial. Stokes was found guilty of selling guns, gunpowder and detonators to the Congo Free State's Afro-Arab enemies. On 14 January 1895 he was sentenced to death and was hanged the next day (hoisted on a tree). To Lothaire, Charles Stokes was no more than a criminal whose hanging was fully justified. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister at the time, commented that if Stokes was in league with Arab slave-trading, then 'he deserved hanging'. Sir John Kirk, for years the British Consul in Zanzibar, remarked that \"he was no loss to us, although he was an honest man.\" The news of Stokes' execution was received with indifference by the British Foreign Office. When the German ambassador asked Sir Thomas H. Sanderson, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether the British government planned to take any steps regarding the execution of this \"well-known character\", Sanderson wrote: \"I do not quite understand why the Germans are pressing us.\" In August 1895, the attention of the British press was drawn to this case by Lionel Decle, a journalist for the Pall Mall Gazette. The press began to report on these events in great detail, The Daily News emphasized 'bloodthirsty precipitation', The Times a 'painful and disgraceful death', The Liverpool Daily Post 'horrified amazement through the British race', The Daily Telegraph 'death like a dog', adding, \"Have we all been wrong in believing that the most audacious foreigner \u2013 not to speak of any savage chief \u2013 would think once, twice and even trice, before he laid hands on a subject of Queen Victoria?\". As a result, the case became an international incident, better known as the Stokes Affair. Together, Britain and Germany pressured the Congo Free State to put Lothaire on trial, which they eventually did, a first trial was held in the city of Boma. The Free State paid compensation to the British (150,000 francs) and Germans (100,000 francs) and made it impossible by decree to impose martial law or death sentences on European citizens. Stokes's body was returned to his family. Lothaire was acquitted twice, first in April 1896 by a tribunal in Boma. In August 1896, the appeal was confirmed in Brussels by the Supreme Court of Congo, paving the way for the rehabilitation of Lothaire. The Stokes Affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State. It also damaged the reputation of King Leopold II of Belgium as a benevolent despot, which he had cultivated with so much effort. The case helped encourage the foundation of the Congo Reform Association \u2013 by Roger Casement and E. D. Morel \u2013 which in its turn put pressure on the Belgian government, which helped lead to the annexation of the Congo Free State by the Belgian state in 1908. For many years prior to the Casement Report there were reports from the Congo alleging widespread abuses and exploitation of the native population. In 1895, the situation was reported to Dr Henry Grattan Guinness (1861\u20131915), a missionary doctor. He had established the Congo-Balolo Mission in 1889, and was promised action by King Leopold later in 1895, but nothing changed. H. R. Fox-Bourne of the Aborigines' Protection Society had published Civilisation in Congoland in 1903, and the journalist E. D. Morel also wrote several articles about the Leopoldian government's behaviour in the Congo Free State. On 20 May 1903 a motion by the Liberal Herbert Samuel was debated in the British House of Commons, resulting in this resolution:... That the Government of the Congo Free State having, at its inception, guaranteed to the Powers that its Native subjects should be governed with humanity, and that no trading monopoly or privilege should be permitted within its dominions, this House requests His Majesty's Government to confer with the other Powers, signatories of the Berlin General Act by virtue of which the Congo\n\nquestion: What was the Stokes Affair?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1136}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Subsequently, the British consul at Boma in the Congo, the Irishman Roger Casement was instructed by Balfour's government to investigate. His report was published in 1904, confirmed Morel's accusations, and had a considerable impact on public opinion. Casement met and became friends with Morel just before the publication of his report in 1904 and realized that he had found the ally he had sought. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organization for dealing specifically with the Congo question. With Casement's and Dr. Guinness's assistance, he set up and ran the Congo Reform Association, which worked to end Leopold's control of the Congo Free State. Branches of the association were established as far away as the United States. The Casement Report comprises forty pages of the Parliamentary Papers, to which is appended another twenty pages of individual statements gathered by Casement as Consul, including several detailing grim tales of killings, mutilations, kidnappings and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo Administration of King Leopold. Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1885, under which much of Africa had been partitioned. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. While the Report was issued as a Command paper in 1904, and was laid before the Houses of Parliament, the original was not published in full until 1985, in an annotated book by two Belgian professors of the history of colonialism. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist political leader and statesman Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold II to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives). Despite these findings, Leopold managed to retain personal control of the Congo until 1908, when the Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration as the Belgian Congo. However the final push came from Leopold's successor King Albert I, and in 1912 the Congo Reform Association had the satisfaction of dissolving itself.\n\nquestion: What was the Stokes Affair?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 621}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Subsequently, the British consul at Boma in the Congo, the Irishman Roger Casement, was instructed to investigate. His report published in 1904, which confirmed Morel's accusations, had a considerable impact on public opinion. Casement met and became friends with Morel just before the publication of his report in 1904 and realized that he had found the ally he had sought. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organization for dealing specifically with the Congo question. With Casement's assistance, he set up and ran the Congo Reform Association, which worked to end Leopold's control of the Congo Free State. Branches of the association were established as far away as the United States. Emile Vandervelde The Casement Report comprises forty pages of the Parliamentary Papers, to which is appended another twenty pages of individual statements gathered by Casement as Consul, including several detailing grim tales of killings, mutilations, kidnappings and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo Administration of King Leopold. Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1885, under which much of Africa had been partitioned. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist leader Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives). Despite these findings, Leopold managed to retain personal control of the Congo until 1908, when the Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration as the Belgian Congo. However the final push came from Leopold's successor King Albert I, and in 1912 the Congo Reform Association had the satisfaction of dissolving itself.\n\nquestion: What was the Stokes Affair?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 820}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The report publicly denounced the atrocious systems of the rubber terror which forced Africans to extract the rubber from lianas to the profit of the State or concessionaries. Published in Great Britain in 1904, the report caused great outrage. The impact of the report in Belgium, however, has been so far underexplored. William Roger Louis mentions the importance of this report to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime and to Belgium\u2019s takeover of the Congo. This position, however, is contested by Jules Marchal, who has stated in his work that \u201cthe king had not to fear a reaction from the Belgian public who showed little interest in the Congo.\u201d None of these studies, however, have looked in depth at the impact of the publication of the Casement Report on the official reactions and on popular opinion in Belgium. This paper seeks to do just that. Keywords Roger Casement, King L\u00e9opold II, Congo Free State, Casement Report, Belgian Congo, Belgium, Commission of Inquiry, anti-Congo campaigns Introduction In July 1903, Roger Casement, as part of his duties as British consul, set out on a journey to the rubber regions of the Congo Free State (henceforth \u201cCFS\u201d). In February 1904, the publication of his report on the harsh living conditions of the indigenous population aroused much indignation within official and popular spheres in Great Britain. Very quickly, Casement and Edmund Morel founded the Congo Reform Association (henceforth \u201cC.R.A\u201d) and proclaimed their goal of putting an end to King L\u00e9opold II\u2019s Congo. And thus started one of the first humanitarian campaigns, one which, in spite of the end of the Congo Free State and its annexation to Belgium in 1908, continued its efforts until 1913. In the wake of the publication of the report in Great Britain, two very different courses of action were put in place. The first was official: the governmental spheres aimed at keeping the balance among European nations and expressing courtesy towards allied countries. The second course of action concerned public opinion: the C.R.A stepped up their propaganda against the CFS in order to stir the hearts of the British people into action. The role of the Casement Report was very different in each case. Officially, Great Britain used it in the hopes of reopening the Congo question with the signatories of the Berlin Conference. For the British people, the Report was certainly the trigger for the creation of the C.R.A but was also quickly replaced both by testimonies, primarily of Protestant missionaries, and by Morel\u2019s multiple books and pamphlets on the ill-treatment of the indigenous population. If studies on Casement\u2019s life and actions are manifold, the analysis of the reception of Casement\u2019s report and its impact in Belgium are important and, yet, relatively neglected research areas. In addition, the passing remarks on the subject are largely contradictory. William Roger Louis argues that the report was a major factor in the end of the CFS: \u201cCasement\u2019s report and his establishment of the C.R.A.,\u201d writes Louis, \u201cwere two feats that contributed greatly to the eventual downfall of the Leopoldian system, and the annexation of the Congo by Belgium.\u201d Jules Marchal, however, expresses the opinion that, because the Belgian population showed \u201clittle interest in the Congo,\u201d its impact was de-facto insignificant. In his contribution, he nevertheless recognizes that the real impact of the Casement Report and its role in the end of the CFS can only be really understood and evaluated by looking at the official and popular spheres within Belgium itself. It is true that the Congolese question was, first and foremost, an issue within Belgian domestic political affairs. Since 1890, Belgium was heir to L\u00e9opold II; and, since 1901, the Belgian Parliament could have started the annexation procedure of the Congo Free State to Belgium, had it wished to do so. Internationally, too, this right was never questioned either by England or by the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference. If the anti-Congo campaign led by the C.R.A. is still remembered elsewhere today, in Belgium itself, it had very little impact, and this is for two main reasons: first, while Casement and Morel\u2019s campaign was a pressurizing factor in Great Britain, it was much less so in Belgium. And second, in a very practical sense, the working language of the report was English, which was at that time not particularly well-known in Belgium. And yet, by criticizing the CFS, Casement and Morel were attacking the King, something that did not leave the\n\nquestion: What was the Stokes Affair?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1080}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since its independence in 1830, Belgium has had a constitutional monarchy. The country has a rather liberal constitution, affording many freedoms to its citizens. One of its articles guarantees the freedom of press and stipulates that censorship can never be established, thereby engendering a quasi-absolute freedom of the press. Belgian society at the time of L\u00e9opold II was organized into different segments, each with their own ideology. There were three pillars at that time: catholic, liberal, and socialist. Each pillar had its own social institutions, including distinct political parties and newspapers. For each of these pillars, the chosen mouthpiece was the press. Political parties and newspapers were so tied up together that it was not uncommon to find parliamentarians, party leaders, and ministers as writers or newspaper editors. For example, the leader of the socialist party, Emile Vandervelde, was one of the columnists for Le Peuple; and the leader of the catholic party, Charles Woeste, was the editor-in-chief of La Revue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Circulation was good, given that about 68% of the population was literate in 1900. For these reasons, we believe that the press is an excellent indicator of the popular opinions of each of the different pillars towards the Casement Report, the anti-Congo campaigns, and the annexation of Congo to Belgium. For this article, we have chosen Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle as the representative of the catholic pillar, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the liberal mouthpiece, and Le Peuple as the expression of the socialist viewpoint. We have also included in the corpus Le Soir which defines itself as a neutral paper. Those press publications subsidized by the CFS such as La Belgique coloniale, L\u2019Etoile belge, and Le Petit Bleu have not been included in this study because their influence was not great on Belgian popular opinion. The debate on the CFS is not limited to popular reactions, and therefore we also consider the official reactions. At the time of the debate Brussels was the capital of two distinct states: Belgium and the CFS, which were only linked together by the figure of King L\u00e9opold II. Thus we scrutinize and discuss at length the reactions of both the Belgian officials and the Congolese administration. The Casement Report as a whole can be read as a travelogue. Casement wrote down his experiences and the personal testimonies of the people he met on his journey. And contrary to popular belief, the Casement Report is not a passionate denunciation of the CFS but rather a well-balanced one. Casement was not, in other words, denouncing at all costs. As Louis explains, the report is \u201cnot a verbally scathing denunciation of the Congo administration,\u201d but rather, it is \u201cunderstated.\u201d Finesse and nuance characterize Casement\u2019s approach. He recognizes the benefits of the Belgian presence on Congolese soil\u2014for instance, in the field of infrastructure\u2014and shares his concerns about the treatment of the indigenous population. The consul was horrified at the drastic depopulation of some areas, which he interpreted either as the outbreak of sleeping sickness, frequent in an African context, or the result of heavy migration to the French Congo. Casement describes the forced labor at the different concessionaries, including Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anversoise and Anglo-Belgian India Rubber company (hencefore Abir), and gives a precise description of the tax system that enslaved the population. In that particular context, he tells the story of a teenage boy, Epondo, who was missing a left hand. The boy\u2019s explanation was that his hand was cut off by a sentry, a Congolese auxiliary employed by the concessionary. Casement personally investigated his case and sent the sentry before the authorities. Casement had, of course, no way of assessing the accuracy of Epondo\u2019s testimony, an issue that will be used against him in later stages. Nevertheless, the Report remains a mirror to the situation of the CFS in 1903. This paper looks at the role and impact of the Casement Report in Belgium. Its assessment within Belgium will help us to understand the part that it played in the end of the CFS and the development of the Belgian Congo. Ultimately, we wish to complicate the connection between Casement\u2019s report and the end of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo, which up to this point has been overly simplified. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part looks at those reactions immediately following the publication of the report, which range from outright hostility to passionate support for the humanitarian cause. This first part also looks at the official responses from the CFS and the inquiry commission set up by the King, which together constitute the official documents of the debate. Casement\u2019s report then comes back in 1912 when the consul wrote another damning condemnation on his\n\nquestion: What was the Stokes Affair?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1100}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Of particular interest are the widely differing reactions to it. The last part of the analysis looks at the reception of the Casement Report at the time of the First World War, a time of propaganda and mythical representations. At this time, Belgians had yet another take on the Casement Report. The anti-Congo campaigns were relentless at this point, pushing Belgian citizens to support the King and to deny the atrocities that had taken place. In addition Casement had been hanged for treason by the British. These two factors combined led to a complete disavowal of the Report. I. Edmund Morel\u2019s Campaign and the Casement Report (1903-1904) The name of Roger Casement and the anti-Congo campaigns are inextricably linked. While being a document among many others condemning King L\u00e9opold\u2019s kingdom, Casement\u2019s report remains a touchstone in anti-Congo campaigns. The intensity of the reactions to the report can only be understood by looking at the context of the creation of the CFS and what it stood for. In his burning ambitions of expanding abroad, L\u00e9opold II did not have the support of the financial and political elites of the country. The different parliamentary majorities saw in this expansion project the endangerment of Belgium\u2019s neutrality, and/or a real danger for Belgium\u2019s neutrality. For the liberals, the immediate priority was to keep good relations with neighboring countries, mainly for the development of the economy. In opposition, the socialists denounced the exploitation of the masses both in the industries and in the colonies. And Belgium\u2019s catholic government of the time, while it did not want to get involved in the Congo question, welcomed the idea of establishing catholic missions abroad. Faced with such opposition, L\u00e9opold II decided to act as an individual. In 1870, the King took up the argument of the civilizing mission. His reputation as a philanthropist had been consistently growing both in Belgium and abroad. The King\u2019s humanitarian interest found echo in the Anglophone world that was thoroughly involved with the abolitionist cause. In other words, the civilizing mission had truly become the leitmotiv of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. For this reason, among others, the CFS would be under the gaze of international public opinion. At the outset, L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan was to operate without imposing customs or import duties. While this option proved to be positive for the creation of the CFS, financially it was untenable\u2014so untenable, in fact, that the King was forced to invest his own finances into the CFS. Debts kept growing and, on the verge of bankruptcy, the King decided to drastically change the economic policy of the CFS. Gone were the days of barter with the local population. Emphasis was now on the harvesting of goods, more specifically rubber and ivory. But this new system also led to the use of violence: the military force now came into play to make sure that the demands of harvesting were met. And with the use of the military force came a plethora of violent acts and atrocities, including rape, murder, and mutilation. The atrocities linked to the rubber trade were then not a sought-out politic of L\u00e9opold II, but rather an indirect consequence of his economic position. In 1895, a campaign\u2014in The Times, among others\u2014denounced the abuse in the CFS. Hearing of these allegations, the Belgian King promised changes and reforms and, in that way, managed to keep the reputation of the CFS intact\u2014that is, until the arrival on the scene of Edmund Morel. Hired by Sir Alfred Jones, business partner of L\u00e9opold II, Morel used his pen to defend the cause of ship-owners in Liverpool. As a clerk for the company Morel noticed that the ships leaving Belgium for the Congo carried guns, chains, and explosives but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the CFS came back full of valuable products such as rubber and ivory. This discovery led him to understand the exploitative nature of the regime. To defend the welfare of Africans, Morel launched his own newspaper\u2014The West African Mail\u2014to denounce the brutal exploitation of the natives. This new publication immediately drew the attention of the CFS. The association of Jones and Morel later fuelled the Belgian fantasy that claimed the merchants of Liverpool were plotting against the country. Morel played an important role in the adoption\u2014by the House of Commons on May 20, 1903\u2014of a motion suggested by British Liberal M.P. Herbert Samuel on the Congo question. Samuel\u2019s motion, based on humanitarian and economic arguments, hoped to reconvene the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference\u2014including Belgium\u2014to discuss once again the Congolese question. In Belgium, the\n\nquestion: What was the Stokes Affair?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1095}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  motion created a form of awkwardness and embarrassment, but not much more. Only Emile Vandervelde, emblematic figure of the socialist movement, and Georges Lorand, a liberal progressive politician, made a stand against the scandal that erupted in the CFS. The socialist deputy suggested to Paul de Favereau, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to intervene in order to shed light on the alleged atrocities. This proposal, however, was rejected on the grounds that Belgium cannot intervene in the affairs of another sovereign State. The very few reactions to this British motion reflected the disengagement that Belgium felt towards the Congo question. L\u00e9opold II did not wish to see the Congolese question placed on the agenda of European governments. The King, in a state of denial about the atrocities, considered these allegations as lies to serve a campaign of covetousness of the CFS by the \u201ccorsaire\u201d Morel, part of an attempt of the British to get their hands on the Congo Free State. The King then launched his own counter-propaganda. One of his first initiatives was to encourage the creation of the FEDIBE (La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration pour la Defense des Inter\u00eats Belges \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tranger) and that of its official organ, La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur le Congo. The drafting of these texts were naturally provided by the Congolese administration. Blamed for mistreatment towards the Congolese people, the King planned another initiative: the enactment of a law in October 1903 limiting the mandatory services of the indigenous people to around forty hours of work per month. Finally, the CFS answered the British motion in contemptuous terms suggesting that it was a plot organized by the merchants of Liverpool. The Congolese government did not suspect at this stage that Casement was authorized in September 1902 to make a journey to the Upper Congo. Early in 1903, Casement already gave a report on the inequalities of the system in place within the CFS. In May, he was appointed official investigator, and the Foreign Office, aware of the parliamentary debates on the Congo question, encouraged him to leave on his journey as soon as possible. On June 5, the Consul left Matadi. He followed the river and passed through L\u00e9opoldville (Kinshasa) and Coquilhatville (Mbandaka), two major cities in the CFS, but he also abandoned his river path to penetrate deeper into the African country. He spent three weeks at Lake Matumba (la Ntomba) that is located in the Domaine de la Couronne, personal property of King L\u00e9opold II. He also stayed for five days in Bongandanga, the ABIR station, on the Lopori River. This last week was crucial to Casement, as he thought he had collected enough material for his report. On September 11, he began his journey back to the Lower Congo and left the African continent to return to Europe on November 7th to begin his report. II. Belgian Reactions to the Casement Report a.1903-1906: The Casement Report and its Responses 1.December 1903\u2014Mid-March 1904: The Casement Report The British consul finalized Casement\u2019s report in December 1903, and it was published in February of the following year. The first official reactions were dated two months prior to the publication of the report. They were full of worry, fear, and suspicion. Pending the publication of the report, L\u00e9opold II threatened to reorient his policy to be closer to Germany. The King desperately wanted his hands on the report, and he sent Sir Alfred Jones, his associate in maritime affairs and consul of the CFS in Liverpool, twice to the Foreign Office to get an exclusive copy of it. In this atmosphere of great suspicion about England\u2019s ulterior motives in this report, the Count of Lalaing, who was Belgian ambassador in London, tried his best to reassure the governmental spheres that the English posed no threat to the Congo. To that end, Lalaing repeated the words of Lord Lansdowne that Britain did not wish to own any part of the CFS. And, upon sending the Casement Report to Brussels, Lalaing shared a confidence qualifying the Report\u2019s tone as fairly moderate. Of course, great was the ambassador\u2019s disappointment when the British press blatantly attacked the Congo and presented it on its front page news as hell on earth. In spite of these setbacks, the Belgian ambassador continued to work towards some form of appeasement between the various parties. During a dinner at Buckingham, for instance, he had a discussion with the Duke of Argyll, Edward VII\u2019s brother-in-law, who ultimately listened attentively to his claims. However, the relationship between the two ruling houses had, according to Edward VII, deteriorated, and it was not part of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan to improve\n\nquestion: What was the Stokes Affair?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1103}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  it. The King had become, as his close collaborators reveal, rather bitter in his later years, and it had become impossible for him to bear any contradiction. King L\u00e9opold\u2019s response to the Casement Report was vindictive. He warned the signatory members that the response of the CFS to the Casement Report would shed light on these allegations and establish the very circumstances reported by the British consul. His personal conviction was that \u201cles attaques exag\u00e9r\u00e9es de M. Casement contre les agents Congolais\u201d justified the word \u201clibel\u201d used by the Belgian consul in Liverpool, Edouard S\u00e8ve. Reprimanded by Foreign Affairs, S\u00e8ve\u2019s attitude was illustrative of the zeal of certain diplomats who wanted to get noticed by the Royal Palace, diplomats such as Charles Sarol\u00e9a, who directly opposed Morel. By contrast, Sir Alfred Jones adopted a rather different attitude towards the problem and strongly recommended avoiding controversy in relation to the Casement Report. Jones nevertheless remained extremely active in the Congo question and hired a number of people who, under the safe umbrella of neutrality, started conducting a number of counter-investigations. One of these people is Lord Mountmorres, an Irish peer who officially worked for the London journal, The Globe. The Irishman sent a report to the Foreign Office that he later published in book form. In his conclusion, Mountmorres made a case in favor of the Congolese administration. The CFS, he argued, was governed humanely. The blame of these atrocities, he continued in his report, fell on the greedy concessionaries. The CFS did not bear, therefore, more responsibility than any other colonial regime. The Belgian press\u2014except for the socialists\u2014mirrored these official concerns. Except for Le Peuple, most press organizations were highly critical of the Casement Report. Most of their reports were filled with downright hostility. The papers emphasized the only positive point in the report: that of the very much-improved state of the infrastructure and the abolishment of the slave trade. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle stressed \u201cl\u2019\u00e9nergie montr\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s belges\u201d to improve what they called, one of the wildest regions in Africa. The rest of their reports discredited both the man himself and his report. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge saw the report as having \u201cun caract\u00e8re tendencieux,\u201d mainly because Casement\u2019s trip lasted two months only, instead of the six that were officially planned. For the liberal paper, L\u00e9opold II accomplished \u201cune \u0153uvre de civilisation et de progr\u00e8s \u00e0 laquelle nulle autre n\u2019est comparable dans l\u2019ordre colonial.\u201d Le Soir, in an article dating back to December 1903, stated that Casement\u2019s work just amounted to \u201cune campagne de d\u00e9nigrement vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019Etat ind\u00e9pendant.\u201d Casement\u2019s findings relating to cruelty and oppression were directly discredited by referring to the counter-investigation carried out in the immediate aftermath of the publication by Marquis Bosco, judge in the CFS. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, compared Casement\u2019s and Bosco\u2019s findings, arguing in favor of the latter. According to the paper, while the English accused the Europeans of cruelty on the Congolese, Bosco demonstrated that these alleged cases of mutilation dated back more than ten years and therefore could not be the responsibility of Europeans. The discourse around British covetousness of the Congo imbued the newspaper articles. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, spoke of \u201cparti pris dans les affaires du Congo.\u201d Le Peuple was the only newspaper of those we examined that had another perspective on the Casement Report. The socialist paper presented the findings as facts \u201cdont l\u2019horreur fait fr\u00e9mir\u201d and wrote of \u201ccaoutchouc rouge.\u201d Le Peuple showed its true opposition to the system in the CFS after the publication of the inquiry commission. Reactions to the Casement Report were diverse in 1903. Except for Le Peuple, which stood for equal chances for all, the rest of these reactions\u2014both official and popular\u2014were shown to be quite distrustful of the report, often deeming it an exaggeration or a ploy to reconvene the Berlin Conference and discuss the Congo case. Words like \u201cexaggeration,\u201d \u201csuspicion,\u201d \u201cmistrust,\u201d \u201cBritish covetousness\u201d and \u201chorror\u201d were used to decry what Casement witnessed in and\n\nquestion: What was the Stokes Affair?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1038}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It definitely led to passionate reactions among the Belgians, some feeling outrage at what they saw as an attack, and others feeling consternation at the treatment of the native population whom, according to the Berlin Conference, the Europeans were supposed to protect. 2.Mid-March 1904\u2014March 1905: Congo Free State Response The CFS gave its official response to the Casement Report on March 12, 1904. The suggestion made by the Congo Free State to conduct a private investigation into Casement\u2019s allegations\u2014just as Joseph Chamberlain had promised for the Fiji Islands\u2014caught the attention of the Foreign Office. This response, and its idea to launch a private investigation, was well-received by the Foreign Office. Francis Villiers, future British ambassador in Brussels, strongly recommended that this inquiry be led by an international commission. Bound by its statement, the Congo Free State sent three commissioners\u2014a Belgian, an Italian, and a Swiss\u2014to assess the situation in the country between October 1904 and February 1905. Neither Casement nor Morel believed in the efficiency of this commission, whose members were, in some form or other, connected to the King. The findings of the international commission were rather more nuanced than Casement\u2019s report. On the whole, it confirmed that atrocities were being committed on Congolese soil but presented the facts with their grey areas. They clearly established that the Epondo case was an exaggeration, a testimony that Casement failed to verify. The findings also suggested possible explanations for the type of behavior exhibited in the Congo (for example, climate, lack of morals, abuse of power, pressure for results). In general, their findings could be considered as more rational and nuanced than those of the Casement Report. In this period immediately following the Congo Free State response, each paper kept the stance that they had established towards the Casement Report. The Catholic and Liberal press emphasized the arguments that offered a more favorable vision of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. Both Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge published the report and were hoping that the response by the CFS would clear up \u201cun malentendu\u201d created by \u201cdes \u00e9l\u00e9ments anglais.\u201d Commenting upon the atrocities, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge wrote that these, which were at first considered as \u201cincontestables,\u201d had now been shown to be refutable. The paper illustrated its claims by means of two examples. First it discussed at length the well-known Epondo case, once the symbol of the oppression of the system and now simply the victim of a hunting accident. And second, in a later article, the paper discussed another mistake made by Casement. Casement had seen a dozen Congolese men travelling in a train carriage from L\u00e9opoldville to Matadi. They were tied up and controlled under the watchful eye of a soldier, leading the consul to believe they were involved in the rubber scandal. In point of fact, these people were a group of men condemned by the Court in Basoko who had come to Matadi to serve their sentence. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge confirmed its full support to the regime in the CFS and expressed its strong disagreement with the idea that the Congo administration led to \u201cun r\u00e9gime syst\u00e9matique de cruaut\u00e9s ou d\u2019oppression.\u201d The paper, nevertheless, acknowledged that some wrongdoings happened in the country, just as they had in any other colony. But then the paper immediately suggested a number of possible suggestions for these acts of cruelty. It argued that when such deeds had been committed, the perpetrators had been severely punished. It then advised its readers to bear in mind the difficulties Belgians had to face in the heart of Africa, a country with more than two hundred languages and where roads had yet to be built. According to L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, the English should have thought \u201caux difficult\u00e9s qui assaillent les officiers au Congo.\u201d It would be easy to condemn, wrote the paper, when \u201con est assis chez soi \u00e0 l\u2019abri du besoin.\u201d The English, therefore, should give some thought \u201c\u00e0 la mentalit\u00e9 de ces hommes bris\u00e9s de corps et d\u2019esprit dans une lutte perp\u00e9tuelle.\u201d Le Soir wrote a number of articles that defended the country against the Casement Report. In its issue of June 30, 1904, the newspaper interviewed Paul Landbeck, an official working in the CFS. Landbeck strongly contested all the allegations of the British consul against the Free State. His view was that the series of atrocities outlined by Casement were carried out fifteen or twenty years ago before the government stepped in to establish law and order. He put the responsibility\n\nquestion: What was the Stokes Affair?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1076}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He believed it \u201cimpossible\u201d that the hands were cut off by Europeans. Landbeck further argued that ill-treatment of the natives was severely punished in the CFS, and that there was no exploitation of the natives to collect rubber. There reigns in the Congo, according to the interviewee, \u201cun ordre parfait.\u201d His view was that \u201cl\u2019Etat remplit sa mission.\u201d The Belgian press continued to establish links between the Casement Report and English covetousness of the Congo. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge believed that the English started their anti-Congo campaigns at the time when the Free State was becoming an extremely prosperous state. The paper held the view that the English blamed the atrocities on the Congo administration with an ulterior motive, that of getting their hands on the Free State: A partir de 1895, le commerce de l\u2019Etat du Congo prend un essor marqu\u00e9, et le chiffre des exportations monte progressivement de 10 millions en 1895 \u00e0 50 millions en 1902. C\u2019est aussi \u00e0 partir d\u2019alors que le mouvement contre l\u2019Etat du Congo se dessine. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que l\u2019Etat affirmera davantage sa vitalit\u00e9 et ses progr\u00e8s, la campagne ira en s\u2019accentuant, s\u2019appuyant sur quelques cas particuliers et isol\u00e9s pour invoquer des pr\u00e9textes d\u2019humanit\u00e9 et dissimuler le v\u00e9ritable objectif des convoitises qui, dans leur impatience, se sont cependant trahies sous la plume des pamphl\u00e9taires et par la voix de membres de la Chambre des communes, mettant nettement en avant la disparition et le partage de l\u2019Etat du Congo. Le Peuple, however, faithful to its belief in a better treatment for all, continued to fight to expose the atrocities. It disagreed with the response by the Congo Free State and sided with Casement and English views on the issue. In June 1904, Le Peuple, to show its support to Casement, quoted at length three other sources in Sir Charles Dilke, English liberal politician, Sir John Garot, and Count Earl Percy, the British Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Dilke claimed that the Congo Free State was \u201cun enfer sur terre.\u201d Sir John Garot followed suit and argued that the country was \u201cune immense cuve dans laquelle fermentent les atrocit\u00e9s, les oppressions et les cruaut\u00e9s.\u201d The positions established in 1903-1904 continued in the same line of thought. Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle supported the response by the Congo Free State, relieving Belgium from blame in these allegations. The argument of British covetousness gathered momentum as the anti-Congo campaigns continued. Emile Vandervelde and Le Peuple, on the other hand, siding with the Casement Report, were still fighting for the defense of the native population in the Free State. Their campaign to expose the atrocities in the Congo Free State took its full measure in the next phase, in the response to the report of the inquiry commission. 3.March 1905 - November 1905: The Commission Report The inquiry commission came back in March 1905 from the Free State and its report was published in November 1905. Because it was published in the Bulletin Officiel, the official journal of the Congo Free State, this report was not accessible to the masses, but rather to a small minority of learned and interested people invested in the Congo question. In addition to the report\u2019s relative lack of visibility, the celebrations for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Belgian independence stirred up dormant patriotic feelings in Belgium. The two major political parties\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014touted the King\u2019s genius. The politicians were aware that an impressive program of embellishment and aggrandizement of Belgium had been made possible thanks to the Congo. The socialist leader, again bravely challenged the government about the atrocities against the native population but, just like in 1903, his concerns fell on deaf ears. The Congo question was compared by Lorand to the Dreyfus case in France. It had become impossible, according to the Liberal deputy, to treat the Congo question without being accused of treason towards Belgium or of collusion with the merchants of Liverpool. It was therefore of no surprise that these\n\nquestion: What was the Stokes Affair?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1059}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle corroborated the commission report, and, in their respective newspapers, primarily printed those findings of the commission that could speak for themselves. One newspaper, however, stood out. Le Peuple showed the full measure of its opposition to the Congo system. While Vandervelde\u2019s voice was not heard in the parliamentary debates, he expressed his views in his socialist newspaper. The socialist leader and his newspaper summarized and quoted the Casement Report in the hope of exposing the cruel system of oppression. They called for a \u201ccampagne de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de piti\u00e9.\u201d The paper focused largely on Abir. The argument against the atrocities was all the more striking since Casement\u2019s findings relating to those concessionaries like Abir were confirmed in the commission report. Le Peuple made a point at presenting in detail the atrocities inflicted on the population to collect the rubber. Le Peuple printed the testimony of victims who came to testify in front of the international commission. They heard the stories of families being taken hostage by Abir because the men did not fill their quota of rubber; they were told about the armed sentries threatening the rubber carriers; they heard the stories of horrific corporal punishment, including floggings and lashes with a chicotte against those that did not fulfill their quotas. The paper described \u201cles civilisateurs Congolais\u201d as follows: On tuait sans distinction les femmes inoffensives et les enfants  Tout cela apparemment pour frapper de terreur ce malheureux peuple et le forcer \u00e0 apporter du caoutchouc  Les t\u00e9moins racont\u00e8rent qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient constamment battus avec la chicotte et que leurs femmes et leurs enfants \u00e9taient continuellement emprisonn\u00e9s, beaucoup de gens mourant soit en prison, soit imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9s. Pendant que les hommes dans la for\u00eat r\u00e9coltaient le caoutchouc, leurs femmes \u00e9taient outrag\u00e9es, maltrait\u00e9es ou enlev\u00e9es par les sentinelles  L\u2019histoire de l\u2019ABIR dans ces r\u00e9gions-ci est une histoire d\u2019oppression, de sang vers\u00e9 et d\u2019iniquit\u00e9. Il lui sera bien difficile d\u2019expier ses torts envers la population. This work of vulgarization and spreading of the Casement Report continued until 1906 when two major works vulgarized the commission report and thereby made it available to a much wider audience. The first of these major works was by liberal F\u00e9licien Cattier, Professor at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles; the other was by Father Vermeersch, a Jesuit. Interestingly, the vulgarization of the report came from two political strands\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014that were at the time staunch supporters of the Congo Free State. Father Vermeersch\u2019s book introduced catholic opinion to the possibility that the anti-Congo campaigns were not simply an attack against the Free State by Protestant missionaries. The annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium soon became a most viable solution. The proposal of annexation was taken so seriously that, led by Vandervelde, the debates were reopened on the Congo question in February 1906. Cattier\u2019s book and the commission report became the touchstones to start reforming the regime of the Congo Free State. During the discussion on the annexation of the Congo, references to Casement were rare, just as were those to Morel. A few days before the annexation in October 1908, Vandervelde once again emphasized the importance of the consul in this thorny issue. b.1910-1914: The Casement Report and the Putumayo Atrocities After his report on the CFS, Casement served as consul in various parts of the world, including Lisbon, the Brazilian port of Santos, followed by S\u00e3o Paulo, at the mouth of the Amazon. In July 1910, Edward Grey insisted that Casement be attached to a commission going to investigate reports of atrocities on the Putumayo River of the upper Amazon. What Casement found there was another oppressive regime. Agents of this regime, reported Casement, administrated inhumane treatment on the native population. Back in Britain, in January 1911, Casement submitted his detailed and damning report to the Foreign Secretary. The British government decided in July 1912 to publish Casement\u2019s report. It was subsequently published in the Belgian\n\nquestion: What was the Stokes Affair?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1041}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Through the lens of the Putumayo Report, new light is shed on a number of interesting remarks on the Casement Report. When the Putumayo Report was commented on in Belgium in July 1912, the status of the CFS had evolved. The annexation of the Congo in 1908 as a colony of Belgium, known as the Belgian Congo, along with the King\u2019s death in 1909, had changed the situation completely. Belgium put L\u00e9opold II on a pedestal and the episode of the red rubber was erased from people\u2019s memory. A striking example of this change in perception is the case of Emile Vandervelde: the man who exposed and condemned the atrocities of the Congo during the Parliamentary debates and in heated and passionate articles in Le Peuple became, after his trip to the Congo, a fervent supporter of the colony. His policies now connected socialism and colonialism by arguing that both these movements had the moral obligation of guardianship towards the less developed people. The socialist leader then distanced himself from Morel\u2019s campaign. From the Belgian perspective, however, the Putumayo Report fell at a bad time. In 1910-12, when the Congo Free State became the Belgian Congo, its new colonial administration reacted rather poorly to the allegations about the inability of the Belgians to rule the Congo. For the authorities of the newly-created Belgian Congo, England froze interference by pursuing its consular inquiries into the Congo. Through a fear either imagined or real, the Congo remained for the Belgian authorities a coveted colony. Important discussions were taking place between Lalaing and Grey regarding the recognition by the English of the annexation of the Congo Free State to Belgium. When Casement returned from Putumayo, Count Lalaing highlighted the similar attitude that London adopted towards the Congo Free State and the Peruvian government.  Upon publication of the Putumayo Report, the British press made allusions to the Congo case and stirred up ancient feuds between the two countries. The ambassador very much regretted that the press made \u201callusions aussi blessantes qu\u2019exag\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ancien r\u00e9gime Congolais.\u201d  If The Times mentioned that the situation was worse in Peru, Morel insisted in The Economist that nothing could be compared to the CFS. The annexation was finally recognized the following year, and Grey\u2019s speech on that occasion was welcomed by L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the clearing of reckless attacks. In contrast, the Belgian government deemed that England was much too slow in her recognition of the Belgian Congo. If Lalaing highlighted similar reactions on the part of London towards both of Casement reports, the press adopted a totally different stance to Casement\u2019s Putumayo Report. There were no connections established in the papers about the fact that both reports were from the same pen. The press treated these two reports as totally distinct. Another striking difference was that, while the Casement Report was passionately debated and condemned as false (apart from a few) between 1903 and 1906, the Putumayo Report was presented in a detached manner, very matter-of-factly. The reports in Le Soir and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle took the form of factual lists of atrocities committed by the Peruvian Amazon Company on the indigenous population to collect rubber in all their excruciating details. The comparison of the treatment established two important facts: the first one was that there was indeed a complete amnesia in Belgium about the Congo atrocities. Not one reference was made to Casement, the damned and criticized author of the report on the CFS. And secondly, the difference in treatments highlighted the fact that, between 1903 and 1906, there was a passionate debate about the Congo question. The Casement Report, contrary to what Jules Marchal argues, did trigger interest and passionate debate among the Belgian population. c.1914-1918: The Casement Report and the Great War At the time of the outbreak of the Great War, Casement was retired. This retirement, however, was rather short lived. He turned his interest to Ireland\u2019s political turmoil. In 1914 Ireland, different political factions opposed each other on the issue of Home Rule, which would grant a Dublin government for the whole of Ireland. Unionists opposed the bill because they feared a loss of power; constitutional nationalists and John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, supported the Home Rule bill. To put actions into words, he urged Irishmen to enlist in the British army. Within the nationalists, there was a more radical Republican wing that included well-known names such as Patrick Pearse, Thomas Clarke, Sean McDermott, and\u2026Roger Casement. The former British consul had decided to fight alongside the republicans in the hope of the birth of an independent Ireland, free and not part of any Empire. Casement sought to obtain German support for a rebellion against English rule\u2014the Easter Rising. Shortly before\n\nquestion: What was the Stokes Affair?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1105}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was convicted and executed for treason. Casement\u2019s involvement in these republican activities ultimately had a profound effect on the perspective of the Casement Report within Belgium. There were very few official responses to Casement\u2019s fate. Casement\u2019s involvement in the Easter Rising and his subsequent arrest were barely mentioned by the Belgian embassy in London. The Belgian Congo\u2019s mother country was deemed at this time \u201cpoor little Belgium,\u201d a country that the British needed to rescue after the German invasion of its territory. Despite the laudatory speeches and gestures of support, King Albert and the Belgian government were deeply concerned by the German occupation of Belgium and by the possible damage to the integrity of the national territory both of Belgium and of the Belgian Congo after the conflict. In this time of great crisis for Belgium, Casement\u2019s trial was not an object of interest for Belgian officials. Instead of going back to ancient feuds, the ambassador, Paul Hymans, worked towards the organization of two Anglo-Belgian events that would demonstrate the intimate friendship between the two countries. Success was complete, and Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, in his speeches, glorified the Belgian attitude. By coincidence, the two events took place shortly before and after Casement\u2019s execution on August 3, 1916. Then, too, the execution of the former consul was not exploited by Belgian officials. Hymans\u2019 personality played a big role in that fact. Following the publication of Morel\u2019s Truth and the War at the end of August, part of the public opinion\u2014including British\u2014was struck by the coincidence between Morel\u2019s statements in 1911, in which he advocated for an Anglo-German rapprochement on the basis of the sharing of the Congo, and the revelations at Casement\u2019s trial. From there emerged the idea that Morel and Casement were agents in the service of Germany, whose aim it was to create tensions between Belgium and Great Britain on the Congo question. This development, however, was rejected by the ambassador, who trusted history to decide on the issue. However, three important elements reversed the situation completely: first, the creation of a propaganda division at the ministry of the colonies in 1916; second, Morel\u2019s condemnation in 1917; and third, the need to look victimized at the peace conference. Now Minister of Foreign affairs, Hymans signed a note for the diplomats, prepared by Octave Louwers. If Louwers, as a young magistrate in the Congo Free State, denounced L\u00e9opold II as a scoundrel, the minister\u2019s adviser suggested not to be intimidated by the memory of the \u201catrocities,\u201d because if L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime had not been faultless, its benefits were too long overshadowed by the accusations orchestrated by questionable characters. Sir Herbert Samuel, author of the motion in May 1903, bowed a quarter of a century later in front of the Belgian work that was now at the forefront of progressive and enlightened colonial administrations. The myth that Morel and Casement were agents of Germany resurged throughout the whole period of the Belgian Congo. While there were very few references to Casement\u2019s fate in the official spheres, the press, on the other hand, turned the Casement\u2019s trial and his hanging into its main headlines. Casement was, in the Belgian press, a \u201ctra\u00eetre.\u201d Le Soir, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge reported Casement\u2019s arrest in every detail, branding him as \u201cIrlando-Boche,\u201d \u201cun agent de l\u2019Allemagne\u201d, and \u201cinventeur et le colporteur de l\u2019abominable l\u00e9gende des \u2018mains coup\u00e9es\u2019.\u201d With an ironic twist, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle asked \u201co\u00f9 sont ces belles d\u00e9clamations sur les atrocit\u00e9s congolaise, sur le \u2018caoutchouc rouge,\u2019 les vibrantes tirades humanitaires?\u201d The journalist compared Casement to a character in a Charles Dickens novel: Il y a dans un roman de Dickens une brave dame qui passe son temps \u00e0 s\u2019occuper des indig\u00e8nes de Borrisbola-Ghaa sur la c\u00f4te d\u2019Afrique\u2014mais qui oublie totalement l\u2019existence de son mari et de ses enfants. Le sieur Casement rappelle cette bonne femme, avec l\u2019infamie en plus. Casement\u2019s friendship with Germany was outlined in every article.

The latter was in favor of Casement\u2019s suggestion to build an army from Irish prisoners of war to fight for the Irish cause. Casement\u2019s treason threw into doubt all the allegations that he made in 1903 on the Belgian administration of the CFS. In light of these events, the Casement Report was completely nullified by the Belgian society of the Great War. Casement\u2019s alignment with Germany was, to the papers, further proof that this man was not to be trusted and that his report was just a pack of lies. In Le Soir, for instance, dating back to April 1916, Casement\u2019s report was fully discredited: \u201cLa plupart des horribles \u00e9pisodes racont\u00e9s par cet \u00e9trange consul \u00e9taient exag\u00e9r\u00e9s et en partie invent\u00e9s  Il \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 ma\u00eetre dans l\u2019art de truquer les photographies et de falsifier les documents.\u201d British attitudes completely changed with regards to the Casement Report. The British that had proclaimed for all the world to hear the atrocities that were taking place in the Belgian Congo now apologized for being \u201cduped\u201d by the traitor Casement. Le Soir reported that the British press expressed \u201cun vif regret d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 entrain\u00e9e par ce tra\u00eetre.\u201d Casement\u2019s report was now being perceived a tool to create a gap between Belgium and England for the benefit of Germany. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle wrote passionately about this particular issue: Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de brouiller la Belgique et l\u2019Angleterre, et, par surcroit la France et l\u2019Angleterre? Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats politiques de l\u2019Allemagne, int\u00e9r\u00eats continentaux et int\u00e9r\u00eats coloniaux compris? Il est grand temps que la r\u00e9putation de la Belgique \u2018calomni\u00e9e\u2019 dans cette affaire, soit enfin r\u00e9habilit\u00e9e. In the light of these events, Belgian papers presented the Belgian Congo colony as being coveted by Germany. Le Soir, for one, wrote that \u201cMorel et Casement  travaillaient \u00e0 d\u00e9pouiller la Belgique de sa colonie, au profit de l\u2019Allemagne.\u201d All in all Casement\u2019s treason was, for Belgium and the Belgian Congo, holy bread. L\u00e9opold II and his humanitarian work in the Congo was now restored to good faith. L\u00e9opold II got his revenge, and the Belgian Congo, former Congo Free State, was reestablished among the model colonies in Africa. L\u00e9opold\u2019s \u0153uvre was \u201cveng\u00e9e des accusations du tra\u00eetre Casement,\u201d  wrote Le Soir. For those living in 1905 and 1906, when L\u00e9opold II was \u201cl\u2019objet d\u2019inf\u00e2mes outrages dans la presse \u00e9trang\u00e8re,\u201d these revelations were \u201cune \u00e9clatante revanche et une grande consolation.\u201d \u201cQuelle revanche,\u201d wrote Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, \u201cpour L\u00e9opold II et nos h\u00e9ros africains que les campagnes des complices de la barbarie allemande avaient r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire passer, m\u00eame aux yeux de certains de leurs compatriotes, pour de monstrueux criminels.\u201d III. Conclusion Roger Casement\u2019s report and the end of the CFS are considered today to be intrinsically connected to one another, the former leading to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo. This connection, however, as this paper hopes to have shown, is much more in the realm of myth than it is of actual historical reality. The direct link that exists in popular imagination between the report and the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo is a simplification of the role and impact of Casement\u2019s denunciatory report. Casement\u2019s report is first and foremost the work of an emphatic man who wished to denounce the suffering of the Congolese population. In Great Britain and the Anglophone world as a whole, the report had a great impact upon both the political and popular spheres of the country. Such an impact can be understood within the recurrent charges of maladministration that took place on L\u00e9opold\u2019s territory since 1895. Casement\u2019s report kindled the spark to this fire of\n\nquestion: What was the Stokes Affair?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1018}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In Belgium, however, the role and impact of the Casement Report was of a totally different nature. Political opinions oscillated between rejection of the report and support for its humanitarian concerns. Belgian socialists and liberals never hesitated in condemning the abuse taking place in the CFS, while the catholics cast a great shadow over the truth and veracity of Casement\u2019s statements. The use of a foreign report, however, was not acceptable within Belgian politics and an enquiry commission was established. The debate, therefore, was not on the basis of Casement\u2019s report, but rather on that of the enquiry commission. The Casement Report was but a piece in the domino effect that led to the annexation of the Congo to Belgium. Even after the annexation, the relentless attack upon L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo awakened Belgium\u2019s national pride. As a reaction there was a phenomenon of collective amnesia concerning the abuse, and L\u00e9opold II was put on a pedestal. The outbreak of the First World War resuscitated the figure of Roger Casement in yet another perspective. The Great War was a time of propaganda where partial truths are turned into patriotic dogmas. With the growing feeling of Belgian national pride, the country framed itself sympathetically with the hanging of Roger Casement by the British authorities for treason. The papers once again insisted on Casement\u2019s report as a pack of lies intended to steal the Congo away from Belgium. Today still, former Belgian colonials look upon Casement\u2019s report as exaggerated and his campaign as mainly anti-Belgian. In the end, the anti-Congo campaign created a dualistic representation of the CFS, one that has been taken up in literature by Adam Hochschild and Mario Vargas Llosa, both of whom represent Casement as the martyr of the humanitarian cause. This image of Casement as a martyr cannot be applied to Roger Casement, who was, and will always remain, a privileged witness of L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo.

This is when the movement against the Congo Free State started to emerge. As the State asserted more and more its vitality and progress, the campaign will keep on growing, relying on some specific and isolated cases to invoke humanity as a pretext to conceal the true objective of their envy.

This report was instrumental in Leopold finally relinquishing his private holdings in Africa. Leopold had held ownership of the Congolese state since 1885, granted to him by the Berlin Conference, in which he exploited its natural resources (mostly rubber) for his own private wealth. Through intercepted letters, Captain Hubert-Joseph Lothaire, the commander of the Congo Free State forces in the Ituri-campaign, learned that Charles Stokes (born in Dublin) was on his way from German East Africa to sell weapons to the Zanzibari slavers in the eastern Congo region. Stokes was arrested and taken to Captain Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a Drumhead court-martial. Stokes was found guilty of selling guns, gunpowder and detonators to the Congo Free State's Afro-Arab enemies. On 14 January 1895 he was sentenced to death and was hanged the next day (hoisted on a tree). To Lothaire, Charles Stokes was no more than a criminal whose hanging was fully justified. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister at the time, commented that if Stokes was in league with Arab slave-trading, then 'he deserved hanging'. Sir John Kirk, for years the British Consul in Zanzibar, remarked that \"he was no loss to us, although he was an honest man.\" The news of Stokes' execution was received with indifference by the British Foreign Office. When the German ambassador asked Sir Thomas H. Sanderson, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether the British government planned to take any steps regarding the execution of this \"well-known character\", Sanderson wrote: \"I do not quite understand why the Germans are pressing us.\" In August 1895, the attention of the British press was drawn to this case by Lionel Decle, a journalist for the Pall Mall Gazette. The press began to report on these events in great detail, The Daily News emphasized 'bloodthirsty precipitation', The Times a 'painful and disgraceful death', The Liverpool Daily Post 'horrified amazement through the British race', The Daily Telegraph 'death like a dog', adding, \"Have we all been wrong in believing that the most audacious foreigner \u2013 not to speak of any savage chief \u2013 would think once, twice and even trice, before he laid hands on a subject of Queen Victoria?\". As a result, the case became an international incident, better known as the Stokes Affair. Together, Britain and Germany pressured the Congo Free State to put Lothaire on trial, which they eventually did, a first trial was held in the city of Boma. The Free State paid compensation to the British (150,000 francs) and Germans (100,000 francs) and made it impossible by decree to impose martial law or death sentences on European citizens. Stokes's body was returned to his family. Lothaire was acquitted twice, first in April 1896 by a tribunal in Boma. In August 1896, the appeal was confirmed in Brussels by the Supreme Court of Congo, paving the way for the rehabilitation of Lothaire. The Stokes Affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State. It also damaged the reputation of King Leopold II of Belgium as a benevolent despot, which he had cultivated with so much effort. The case helped encourage the foundation of the Congo Reform Association \u2013 by Roger Casement and E. D. Morel \u2013 which in its turn put pressure on the Belgian government, which helped lead to the annexation of the Congo Free State by the Belgian state in 1908. For many years prior to the Casement Report there were reports from the Congo alleging widespread abuses and exploitation of the native population. In 1895, the situation was reported to Dr Henry Grattan Guinness (1861\u20131915), a missionary doctor. He had established the Congo-Balolo Mission in 1889, and was promised action by King Leopold later in 1895, but nothing changed. H. R. Fox-Bourne of the Aborigines' Protection Society had published Civilisation in Congoland in 1903, and the journalist E. D. Morel also wrote several articles about the Leopoldian government's behaviour in the Congo Free State. On 20 May 1903 a motion by the Liberal Herbert Samuel was debated in the British House of Commons, resulting in this resolution:... That the Government of the Congo Free State having, at its inception, guaranteed to the Powers that its Native subjects should be governed with humanity, and that no trading monopoly or privilege should be permitted within its dominions, this House requests His Majesty's Government to confer with the other Powers, signatories of the Berlin General Act by virtue of which the Congo\n\nquestion: What did the Stokes Affair lead to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The formation of the Congo Reform Association.", "usage": 1144}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Subsequently, the British consul at Boma in the Congo, the Irishman Roger Casement was instructed by Balfour's government to investigate. His report was published in 1904, confirmed Morel's accusations, and had a considerable impact on public opinion. Casement met and became friends with Morel just before the publication of his report in 1904 and realized that he had found the ally he had sought. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organization for dealing specifically with the Congo question. With Casement's and Dr. Guinness's assistance, he set up and ran the Congo Reform Association, which worked to end Leopold's control of the Congo Free State. Branches of the association were established as far away as the United States. The Casement Report comprises forty pages of the Parliamentary Papers, to which is appended another twenty pages of individual statements gathered by Casement as Consul, including several detailing grim tales of killings, mutilations, kidnappings and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo Administration of King Leopold. Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1885, under which much of Africa had been partitioned. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. While the Report was issued as a Command paper in 1904, and was laid before the Houses of Parliament, the original was not published in full until 1985, in an annotated book by two Belgian professors of the history of colonialism. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist political leader and statesman Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold II to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives). Despite these findings, Leopold managed to retain personal control of the Congo until 1908, when the Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration as the Belgian Congo. However the final push came from Leopold's successor King Albert I, and in 1912 the Congo Reform Association had the satisfaction of dissolving itself.\n\nquestion: What did the Stokes Affair lead to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 623}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In 1903, two years after the death of King Leopold's cousin Queen Victoria, the British House of Commons passed a critical resolution on the Congo. Subsequently, the British consul at Boma in the Congo, the Irishman Roger Casement, was instructed to investigate. His report published in 1904, which confirmed Morel's accusations, had a considerable impact on public opinion. Casement met and became friends with Morel just before the publication of his report in 1904 and realized that he had found the ally he had sought. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organization for dealing specifically with the Congo question. With Casement's assistance, he set up and ran the Congo Reform Association, which worked to end Leopold's control of the Congo Free State. Branches of the association were established as far away as the United States. Emile Vandervelde The Casement Report comprises forty pages of the Parliamentary Papers, to which is appended another twenty pages of individual statements gathered by Casement as Consul, including several detailing grim tales of killings, mutilations, kidnappings and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo Administration of King Leopold. Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1885, under which much of Africa had been partitioned. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist leader Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives). Despite these findings, Leopold managed to retain personal control of the Congo until 1908, when the Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration as the Belgian Congo. However the final push came from Leopold's successor King Albert I, and in 1912 the Congo Reform Association had the satisfaction of dissolving itself.\n\nquestion: What did the Stokes Affair lead to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The arrest and punishment of officials responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903.", "usage": 839}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The report publicly denounced the atrocious systems of the rubber terror which forced Africans to extract the rubber from lianas to the profit of the State or concessionaries. Published in Great Britain in 1904, the report caused great outrage. The impact of the report in Belgium, however, has been so far underexplored. William Roger Louis mentions the importance of this report to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime and to Belgium\u2019s takeover of the Congo. This position, however, is contested by Jules Marchal, who has stated in his work that \u201cthe king had not to fear a reaction from the Belgian public who showed little interest in the Congo.\u201d None of these studies, however, have looked in depth at the impact of the publication of the Casement Report on the official reactions and on popular opinion in Belgium. This paper seeks to do just that. Keywords Roger Casement, King L\u00e9opold II, Congo Free State, Casement Report, Belgian Congo, Belgium, Commission of Inquiry, anti-Congo campaigns Introduction In July 1903, Roger Casement, as part of his duties as British consul, set out on a journey to the rubber regions of the Congo Free State (henceforth \u201cCFS\u201d). In February 1904, the publication of his report on the harsh living conditions of the indigenous population aroused much indignation within official and popular spheres in Great Britain. Very quickly, Casement and Edmund Morel founded the Congo Reform Association (henceforth \u201cC.R.A\u201d) and proclaimed their goal of putting an end to King L\u00e9opold II\u2019s Congo. And thus started one of the first humanitarian campaigns, one which, in spite of the end of the Congo Free State and its annexation to Belgium in 1908, continued its efforts until 1913. In the wake of the publication of the report in Great Britain, two very different courses of action were put in place. The first was official: the governmental spheres aimed at keeping the balance among European nations and expressing courtesy towards allied countries. The second course of action concerned public opinion: the C.R.A stepped up their propaganda against the CFS in order to stir the hearts of the British people into action. The role of the Casement Report was very different in each case. Officially, Great Britain used it in the hopes of reopening the Congo question with the signatories of the Berlin Conference. For the British people, the Report was certainly the trigger for the creation of the C.R.A but was also quickly replaced both by testimonies, primarily of Protestant missionaries, and by Morel\u2019s multiple books and pamphlets on the ill-treatment of the indigenous population. If studies on Casement\u2019s life and actions are manifold, the analysis of the reception of Casement\u2019s report and its impact in Belgium are important and, yet, relatively neglected research areas. In addition, the passing remarks on the subject are largely contradictory. William Roger Louis argues that the report was a major factor in the end of the CFS: \u201cCasement\u2019s report and his establishment of the C.R.A.,\u201d writes Louis, \u201cwere two feats that contributed greatly to the eventual downfall of the Leopoldian system, and the annexation of the Congo by Belgium.\u201d Jules Marchal, however, expresses the opinion that, because the Belgian population showed \u201clittle interest in the Congo,\u201d its impact was de-facto insignificant. In his contribution, he nevertheless recognizes that the real impact of the Casement Report and its role in the end of the CFS can only be really understood and evaluated by looking at the official and popular spheres within Belgium itself. It is true that the Congolese question was, first and foremost, an issue within Belgian domestic political affairs. Since 1890, Belgium was heir to L\u00e9opold II; and, since 1901, the Belgian Parliament could have started the annexation procedure of the Congo Free State to Belgium, had it wished to do so. Internationally, too, this right was never questioned either by England or by the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference. If the anti-Congo campaign led by the C.R.A. is still remembered elsewhere today, in Belgium itself, it had very little impact, and this is for two main reasons: first, while Casement and Morel\u2019s campaign was a pressurizing factor in Great Britain, it was much less so in Belgium. And second, in a very practical sense, the working language of the report was English, which was at that time not particularly well-known in Belgium. And yet, by criticizing the CFS, Casement and Morel were attacking the King, something that did not leave the\n\nquestion: What did the Stokes Affair lead to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1082}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since its independence in 1830, Belgium has had a constitutional monarchy. The country has a rather liberal constitution, affording many freedoms to its citizens. One of its articles guarantees the freedom of press and stipulates that censorship can never be established, thereby engendering a quasi-absolute freedom of the press. Belgian society at the time of L\u00e9opold II was organized into different segments, each with their own ideology. There were three pillars at that time: catholic, liberal, and socialist. Each pillar had its own social institutions, including distinct political parties and newspapers. For each of these pillars, the chosen mouthpiece was the press. Political parties and newspapers were so tied up together that it was not uncommon to find parliamentarians, party leaders, and ministers as writers or newspaper editors. For example, the leader of the socialist party, Emile Vandervelde, was one of the columnists for Le Peuple; and the leader of the catholic party, Charles Woeste, was the editor-in-chief of La Revue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Circulation was good, given that about 68% of the population was literate in 1900. For these reasons, we believe that the press is an excellent indicator of the popular opinions of each of the different pillars towards the Casement Report, the anti-Congo campaigns, and the annexation of Congo to Belgium. For this article, we have chosen Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle as the representative of the catholic pillar, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the liberal mouthpiece, and Le Peuple as the expression of the socialist viewpoint. We have also included in the corpus Le Soir which defines itself as a neutral paper. Those press publications subsidized by the CFS such as La Belgique coloniale, L\u2019Etoile belge, and Le Petit Bleu have not been included in this study because their influence was not great on Belgian popular opinion. The debate on the CFS is not limited to popular reactions, and therefore we also consider the official reactions. At the time of the debate Brussels was the capital of two distinct states: Belgium and the CFS, which were only linked together by the figure of King L\u00e9opold II. Thus we scrutinize and discuss at length the reactions of both the Belgian officials and the Congolese administration. The Casement Report as a whole can be read as a travelogue. Casement wrote down his experiences and the personal testimonies of the people he met on his journey. And contrary to popular belief, the Casement Report is not a passionate denunciation of the CFS but rather a well-balanced one. Casement was not, in other words, denouncing at all costs. As Louis explains, the report is \u201cnot a verbally scathing denunciation of the Congo administration,\u201d but rather, it is \u201cunderstated.\u201d Finesse and nuance characterize Casement\u2019s approach. He recognizes the benefits of the Belgian presence on Congolese soil\u2014for instance, in the field of infrastructure\u2014and shares his concerns about the treatment of the indigenous population. The consul was horrified at the drastic depopulation of some areas, which he interpreted either as the outbreak of sleeping sickness, frequent in an African context, or the result of heavy migration to the French Congo. Casement describes the forced labor at the different concessionaries, including Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anversoise and Anglo-Belgian India Rubber company (hencefore Abir), and gives a precise description of the tax system that enslaved the population. In that particular context, he tells the story of a teenage boy, Epondo, who was missing a left hand. The boy\u2019s explanation was that his hand was cut off by a sentry, a Congolese auxiliary employed by the concessionary. Casement personally investigated his case and sent the sentry before the authorities. Casement had, of course, no way of assessing the accuracy of Epondo\u2019s testimony, an issue that will be used against him in later stages. Nevertheless, the Report remains a mirror to the situation of the CFS in 1903. This paper looks at the role and impact of the Casement Report in Belgium. Its assessment within Belgium will help us to understand the part that it played in the end of the CFS and the development of the Belgian Congo. Ultimately, we wish to complicate the connection between Casement\u2019s report and the end of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo, which up to this point has been overly simplified. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part looks at those reactions immediately following the publication of the report, which range from outright hostility to passionate support for the humanitarian cause. This first part also looks at the official responses from the CFS and the inquiry commission set up by the King, which together constitute the official documents of the debate. Casement\u2019s report then comes back in 1912 when the consul wrote another damning condemnation on his\n\nquestion: What did the Stokes Affair lead to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1102}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Of particular interest are the widely differing reactions to it. The last part of the analysis looks at the reception of the Casement Report at the time of the First World War, a time of propaganda and mythical representations. At this time, Belgians had yet another take on the Casement Report. The anti-Congo campaigns were relentless at this point, pushing Belgian citizens to support the King and to deny the atrocities that had taken place. In addition Casement had been hanged for treason by the British. These two factors combined led to a complete disavowal of the Report. I. Edmund Morel\u2019s Campaign and the Casement Report (1903-1904) The name of Roger Casement and the anti-Congo campaigns are inextricably linked. While being a document among many others condemning King L\u00e9opold\u2019s kingdom, Casement\u2019s report remains a touchstone in anti-Congo campaigns. The intensity of the reactions to the report can only be understood by looking at the context of the creation of the CFS and what it stood for. In his burning ambitions of expanding abroad, L\u00e9opold II did not have the support of the financial and political elites of the country. The different parliamentary majorities saw in this expansion project the endangerment of Belgium\u2019s neutrality, and/or a real danger for Belgium\u2019s neutrality. For the liberals, the immediate priority was to keep good relations with neighboring countries, mainly for the development of the economy. In opposition, the socialists denounced the exploitation of the masses both in the industries and in the colonies. And Belgium\u2019s catholic government of the time, while it did not want to get involved in the Congo question, welcomed the idea of establishing catholic missions abroad. Faced with such opposition, L\u00e9opold II decided to act as an individual. In 1870, the King took up the argument of the civilizing mission. His reputation as a philanthropist had been consistently growing both in Belgium and abroad. The King\u2019s humanitarian interest found echo in the Anglophone world that was thoroughly involved with the abolitionist cause. In other words, the civilizing mission had truly become the leitmotiv of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. For this reason, among others, the CFS would be under the gaze of international public opinion. At the outset, L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan was to operate without imposing customs or import duties. While this option proved to be positive for the creation of the CFS, financially it was untenable\u2014so untenable, in fact, that the King was forced to invest his own finances into the CFS. Debts kept growing and, on the verge of bankruptcy, the King decided to drastically change the economic policy of the CFS. Gone were the days of barter with the local population. Emphasis was now on the harvesting of goods, more specifically rubber and ivory. But this new system also led to the use of violence: the military force now came into play to make sure that the demands of harvesting were met. And with the use of the military force came a plethora of violent acts and atrocities, including rape, murder, and mutilation. The atrocities linked to the rubber trade were then not a sought-out politic of L\u00e9opold II, but rather an indirect consequence of his economic position. In 1895, a campaign\u2014in The Times, among others\u2014denounced the abuse in the CFS. Hearing of these allegations, the Belgian King promised changes and reforms and, in that way, managed to keep the reputation of the CFS intact\u2014that is, until the arrival on the scene of Edmund Morel. Hired by Sir Alfred Jones, business partner of L\u00e9opold II, Morel used his pen to defend the cause of ship-owners in Liverpool. As a clerk for the company Morel noticed that the ships leaving Belgium for the Congo carried guns, chains, and explosives but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the CFS came back full of valuable products such as rubber and ivory. This discovery led him to understand the exploitative nature of the regime. To defend the welfare of Africans, Morel launched his own newspaper\u2014The West African Mail\u2014to denounce the brutal exploitation of the natives. This new publication immediately drew the attention of the CFS. The association of Jones and Morel later fuelled the Belgian fantasy that claimed the merchants of Liverpool were plotting against the country. Morel played an important role in the adoption\u2014by the House of Commons on May 20, 1903\u2014of a motion suggested by British Liberal M.P. Herbert Samuel on the Congo question. Samuel\u2019s motion, based on humanitarian and economic arguments, hoped to reconvene the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference\u2014including Belgium\u2014to discuss once again the Congolese question. In Belgium, the\n\nquestion: What did the Stokes Affair lead to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1097}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  motion created a form of awkwardness and embarrassment, but not much more. Only Emile Vandervelde, emblematic figure of the socialist movement, and Georges Lorand, a liberal progressive politician, made a stand against the scandal that erupted in the CFS. The socialist deputy suggested to Paul de Favereau, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to intervene in order to shed light on the alleged atrocities. This proposal, however, was rejected on the grounds that Belgium cannot intervene in the affairs of another sovereign State. The very few reactions to this British motion reflected the disengagement that Belgium felt towards the Congo question. L\u00e9opold II did not wish to see the Congolese question placed on the agenda of European governments. The King, in a state of denial about the atrocities, considered these allegations as lies to serve a campaign of covetousness of the CFS by the \u201ccorsaire\u201d Morel, part of an attempt of the British to get their hands on the Congo Free State. The King then launched his own counter-propaganda. One of his first initiatives was to encourage the creation of the FEDIBE (La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration pour la Defense des Inter\u00eats Belges \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tranger) and that of its official organ, La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur le Congo. The drafting of these texts were naturally provided by the Congolese administration. Blamed for mistreatment towards the Congolese people, the King planned another initiative: the enactment of a law in October 1903 limiting the mandatory services of the indigenous people to around forty hours of work per month. Finally, the CFS answered the British motion in contemptuous terms suggesting that it was a plot organized by the merchants of Liverpool. The Congolese government did not suspect at this stage that Casement was authorized in September 1902 to make a journey to the Upper Congo. Early in 1903, Casement already gave a report on the inequalities of the system in place within the CFS. In May, he was appointed official investigator, and the Foreign Office, aware of the parliamentary debates on the Congo question, encouraged him to leave on his journey as soon as possible. On June 5, the Consul left Matadi. He followed the river and passed through L\u00e9opoldville (Kinshasa) and Coquilhatville (Mbandaka), two major cities in the CFS, but he also abandoned his river path to penetrate deeper into the African country. He spent three weeks at Lake Matumba (la Ntomba) that is located in the Domaine de la Couronne, personal property of King L\u00e9opold II. He also stayed for five days in Bongandanga, the ABIR station, on the Lopori River. This last week was crucial to Casement, as he thought he had collected enough material for his report. On September 11, he began his journey back to the Lower Congo and left the African continent to return to Europe on November 7th to begin his report. II. Belgian Reactions to the Casement Report a.1903-1906: The Casement Report and its Responses 1.December 1903\u2014Mid-March 1904: The Casement Report The British consul finalized Casement\u2019s report in December 1903, and it was published in February of the following year. The first official reactions were dated two months prior to the publication of the report. They were full of worry, fear, and suspicion. Pending the publication of the report, L\u00e9opold II threatened to reorient his policy to be closer to Germany. The King desperately wanted his hands on the report, and he sent Sir Alfred Jones, his associate in maritime affairs and consul of the CFS in Liverpool, twice to the Foreign Office to get an exclusive copy of it. In this atmosphere of great suspicion about England\u2019s ulterior motives in this report, the Count of Lalaing, who was Belgian ambassador in London, tried his best to reassure the governmental spheres that the English posed no threat to the Congo. To that end, Lalaing repeated the words of Lord Lansdowne that Britain did not wish to own any part of the CFS. And, upon sending the Casement Report to Brussels, Lalaing shared a confidence qualifying the Report\u2019s tone as fairly moderate. Of course, great was the ambassador\u2019s disappointment when the British press blatantly attacked the Congo and presented it on its front page news as hell on earth. In spite of these setbacks, the Belgian ambassador continued to work towards some form of appeasement between the various parties. During a dinner at Buckingham, for instance, he had a discussion with the Duke of Argyll, Edward VII\u2019s brother-in-law, who ultimately listened attentively to his claims. However, the relationship between the two ruling houses had, according to Edward VII, deteriorated, and it was not part of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan to improve\n\nquestion: What did the Stokes Affair lead to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1105}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  it. The King had become, as his close collaborators reveal, rather bitter in his later years, and it had become impossible for him to bear any contradiction. King L\u00e9opold\u2019s response to the Casement Report was vindictive. He warned the signatory members that the response of the CFS to the Casement Report would shed light on these allegations and establish the very circumstances reported by the British consul. His personal conviction was that \u201cles attaques exag\u00e9r\u00e9es de M. Casement contre les agents Congolais\u201d justified the word \u201clibel\u201d used by the Belgian consul in Liverpool, Edouard S\u00e8ve. Reprimanded by Foreign Affairs, S\u00e8ve\u2019s attitude was illustrative of the zeal of certain diplomats who wanted to get noticed by the Royal Palace, diplomats such as Charles Sarol\u00e9a, who directly opposed Morel. By contrast, Sir Alfred Jones adopted a rather different attitude towards the problem and strongly recommended avoiding controversy in relation to the Casement Report. Jones nevertheless remained extremely active in the Congo question and hired a number of people who, under the safe umbrella of neutrality, started conducting a number of counter-investigations. One of these people is Lord Mountmorres, an Irish peer who officially worked for the London journal, The Globe. The Irishman sent a report to the Foreign Office that he later published in book form. In his conclusion, Mountmorres made a case in favor of the Congolese administration. The CFS, he argued, was governed humanely. The blame of these atrocities, he continued in his report, fell on the greedy concessionaries. The CFS did not bear, therefore, more responsibility than any other colonial regime. The Belgian press\u2014except for the socialists\u2014mirrored these official concerns. Except for Le Peuple, most press organizations were highly critical of the Casement Report. Most of their reports were filled with downright hostility. The papers emphasized the only positive point in the report: that of the very much-improved state of the infrastructure and the abolishment of the slave trade. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle stressed \u201cl\u2019\u00e9nergie montr\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s belges\u201d to improve what they called, one of the wildest regions in Africa. The rest of their reports discredited both the man himself and his report. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge saw the report as having \u201cun caract\u00e8re tendencieux,\u201d mainly because Casement\u2019s trip lasted two months only, instead of the six that were officially planned. For the liberal paper, L\u00e9opold II accomplished \u201cune \u0153uvre de civilisation et de progr\u00e8s \u00e0 laquelle nulle autre n\u2019est comparable dans l\u2019ordre colonial.\u201d Le Soir, in an article dating back to December 1903, stated that Casement\u2019s work just amounted to \u201cune campagne de d\u00e9nigrement vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019Etat ind\u00e9pendant.\u201d Casement\u2019s findings relating to cruelty and oppression were directly discredited by referring to the counter-investigation carried out in the immediate aftermath of the publication by Marquis Bosco, judge in the CFS. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, compared Casement\u2019s and Bosco\u2019s findings, arguing in favor of the latter. According to the paper, while the English accused the Europeans of cruelty on the Congolese, Bosco demonstrated that these alleged cases of mutilation dated back more than ten years and therefore could not be the responsibility of Europeans. The discourse around British covetousness of the Congo imbued the newspaper articles. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, spoke of \u201cparti pris dans les affaires du Congo.\u201d Le Peuple was the only newspaper of those we examined that had another perspective on the Casement Report. The socialist paper presented the findings as facts \u201cdont l\u2019horreur fait fr\u00e9mir\u201d and wrote of \u201ccaoutchouc rouge.\u201d Le Peuple showed its true opposition to the system in the CFS after the publication of the inquiry commission. Reactions to the Casement Report were diverse in 1903. Except for Le Peuple, which stood for equal chances for all, the rest of these reactions\u2014both official and popular\u2014were shown to be quite distrustful of the report, often deeming it an exaggeration or a ploy to reconvene the Berlin Conference and discuss the Congo case. Words like \u201cexaggeration,\u201d \u201csuspicion,\u201d \u201cmistrust,\u201d \u201cBritish covetousness\u201d and \u201chorror\u201d were used to decry what Casement witnessed in and\n\nquestion: What did the Stokes Affair lead to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1040}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It definitely led to passionate reactions among the Belgians, some feeling outrage at what they saw as an attack, and others feeling consternation at the treatment of the native population whom, according to the Berlin Conference, the Europeans were supposed to protect. 2.Mid-March 1904\u2014March 1905: Congo Free State Response The CFS gave its official response to the Casement Report on March 12, 1904. The suggestion made by the Congo Free State to conduct a private investigation into Casement\u2019s allegations\u2014just as Joseph Chamberlain had promised for the Fiji Islands\u2014caught the attention of the Foreign Office. This response, and its idea to launch a private investigation, was well-received by the Foreign Office. Francis Villiers, future British ambassador in Brussels, strongly recommended that this inquiry be led by an international commission. Bound by its statement, the Congo Free State sent three commissioners\u2014a Belgian, an Italian, and a Swiss\u2014to assess the situation in the country between October 1904 and February 1905. Neither Casement nor Morel believed in the efficiency of this commission, whose members were, in some form or other, connected to the King. The findings of the international commission were rather more nuanced than Casement\u2019s report. On the whole, it confirmed that atrocities were being committed on Congolese soil but presented the facts with their grey areas. They clearly established that the Epondo case was an exaggeration, a testimony that Casement failed to verify. The findings also suggested possible explanations for the type of behavior exhibited in the Congo (for example, climate, lack of morals, abuse of power, pressure for results). In general, their findings could be considered as more rational and nuanced than those of the Casement Report. In this period immediately following the Congo Free State response, each paper kept the stance that they had established towards the Casement Report. The Catholic and Liberal press emphasized the arguments that offered a more favorable vision of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. Both Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge published the report and were hoping that the response by the CFS would clear up \u201cun malentendu\u201d created by \u201cdes \u00e9l\u00e9ments anglais.\u201d Commenting upon the atrocities, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge wrote that these, which were at first considered as \u201cincontestables,\u201d had now been shown to be refutable. The paper illustrated its claims by means of two examples. First it discussed at length the well-known Epondo case, once the symbol of the oppression of the system and now simply the victim of a hunting accident. And second, in a later article, the paper discussed another mistake made by Casement. Casement had seen a dozen Congolese men travelling in a train carriage from L\u00e9opoldville to Matadi. They were tied up and controlled under the watchful eye of a soldier, leading the consul to believe they were involved in the rubber scandal. In point of fact, these people were a group of men condemned by the Court in Basoko who had come to Matadi to serve their sentence. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge confirmed its full support to the regime in the CFS and expressed its strong disagreement with the idea that the Congo administration led to \u201cun r\u00e9gime syst\u00e9matique de cruaut\u00e9s ou d\u2019oppression.\u201d The paper, nevertheless, acknowledged that some wrongdoings happened in the country, just as they had in any other colony. But then the paper immediately suggested a number of possible suggestions for these acts of cruelty. It argued that when such deeds had been committed, the perpetrators had been severely punished. It then advised its readers to bear in mind the difficulties Belgians had to face in the heart of Africa, a country with more than two hundred languages and where roads had yet to be built. According to L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, the English should have thought \u201caux difficult\u00e9s qui assaillent les officiers au Congo.\u201d It would be easy to condemn, wrote the paper, when \u201con est assis chez soi \u00e0 l\u2019abri du besoin.\u201d The English, therefore, should give some thought \u201c\u00e0 la mentalit\u00e9 de ces hommes bris\u00e9s de corps et d\u2019esprit dans une lutte perp\u00e9tuelle.\u201d Le Soir wrote a number of articles that defended the country against the Casement Report. In its issue of June 30, 1904, the newspaper interviewed Paul Landbeck, an official working in the CFS. Landbeck strongly contested all the allegations of the British consul against the Free State. His view was that the series of atrocities outlined by Casement were carried out fifteen or twenty years ago before the government stepped in to establish law and order. He put the responsibility\n\nquestion: What did the Stokes Affair lead to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1078}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He believed it \u201cimpossible\u201d that the hands were cut off by Europeans. Landbeck further argued that ill-treatment of the natives was severely punished in the CFS, and that there was no exploitation of the natives to collect rubber. There reigns in the Congo, according to the interviewee, \u201cun ordre parfait.\u201d His view was that \u201cl\u2019Etat remplit sa mission.\u201d The Belgian press continued to establish links between the Casement Report and English covetousness of the Congo. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge believed that the English started their anti-Congo campaigns at the time when the Free State was becoming an extremely prosperous state. The paper held the view that the English blamed the atrocities on the Congo administration with an ulterior motive, that of getting their hands on the Free State: A partir de 1895, le commerce de l\u2019Etat du Congo prend un essor marqu\u00e9, et le chiffre des exportations monte progressivement de 10 millions en 1895 \u00e0 50 millions en 1902. C\u2019est aussi \u00e0 partir d\u2019alors que le mouvement contre l\u2019Etat du Congo se dessine. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que l\u2019Etat affirmera davantage sa vitalit\u00e9 et ses progr\u00e8s, la campagne ira en s\u2019accentuant, s\u2019appuyant sur quelques cas particuliers et isol\u00e9s pour invoquer des pr\u00e9textes d\u2019humanit\u00e9 et dissimuler le v\u00e9ritable objectif des convoitises qui, dans leur impatience, se sont cependant trahies sous la plume des pamphl\u00e9taires et par la voix de membres de la Chambre des communes, mettant nettement en avant la disparition et le partage de l\u2019Etat du Congo. Le Peuple, however, faithful to its belief in a better treatment for all, continued to fight to expose the atrocities. It disagreed with the response by the Congo Free State and sided with Casement and English views on the issue. In June 1904, Le Peuple, to show its support to Casement, quoted at length three other sources in Sir Charles Dilke, English liberal politician, Sir John Garot, and Count Earl Percy, the British Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Dilke claimed that the Congo Free State was \u201cun enfer sur terre.\u201d Sir John Garot followed suit and argued that the country was \u201cune immense cuve dans laquelle fermentent les atrocit\u00e9s, les oppressions et les cruaut\u00e9s.\u201d The positions established in 1903-1904 continued in the same line of thought. Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle supported the response by the Congo Free State, relieving Belgium from blame in these allegations. The argument of British covetousness gathered momentum as the anti-Congo campaigns continued. Emile Vandervelde and Le Peuple, on the other hand, siding with the Casement Report, were still fighting for the defense of the native population in the Free State. Their campaign to expose the atrocities in the Congo Free State took its full measure in the next phase, in the response to the report of the inquiry commission. 3.March 1905 - November 1905: The Commission Report The inquiry commission came back in March 1905 from the Free State and its report was published in November 1905. Because it was published in the Bulletin Officiel, the official journal of the Congo Free State, this report was not accessible to the masses, but rather to a small minority of learned and interested people invested in the Congo question. In addition to the report\u2019s relative lack of visibility, the celebrations for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Belgian independence stirred up dormant patriotic feelings in Belgium. The two major political parties\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014touted the King\u2019s genius. The politicians were aware that an impressive program of embellishment and aggrandizement of Belgium had been made possible thanks to the Congo. The socialist leader, again bravely challenged the government about the atrocities against the native population but, just like in 1903, his concerns fell on deaf ears. The Congo question was compared by Lorand to the Dreyfus case in France. It had become impossible, according to the Liberal deputy, to treat the Congo question without being accused of treason towards Belgium or of collusion with the merchants of Liverpool. It was therefore of no surprise that these\n\nquestion: What did the Stokes Affair lead to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1061}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle corroborated the commission report, and, in their respective newspapers, primarily printed those findings of the commission that could speak for themselves. One newspaper, however, stood out. Le Peuple showed the full measure of its opposition to the Congo system. While Vandervelde\u2019s voice was not heard in the parliamentary debates, he expressed his views in his socialist newspaper. The socialist leader and his newspaper summarized and quoted the Casement Report in the hope of exposing the cruel system of oppression. They called for a \u201ccampagne de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de piti\u00e9.\u201d The paper focused largely on Abir. The argument against the atrocities was all the more striking since Casement\u2019s findings relating to those concessionaries like Abir were confirmed in the commission report. Le Peuple made a point at presenting in detail the atrocities inflicted on the population to collect the rubber. Le Peuple printed the testimony of victims who came to testify in front of the international commission. They heard the stories of families being taken hostage by Abir because the men did not fill their quota of rubber; they were told about the armed sentries threatening the rubber carriers; they heard the stories of horrific corporal punishment, including floggings and lashes with a chicotte against those that did not fulfill their quotas. The paper described \u201cles civilisateurs Congolais\u201d as follows: On tuait sans distinction les femmes inoffensives et les enfants  Tout cela apparemment pour frapper de terreur ce malheureux peuple et le forcer \u00e0 apporter du caoutchouc  Les t\u00e9moins racont\u00e8rent qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient constamment battus avec la chicotte et que leurs femmes et leurs enfants \u00e9taient continuellement emprisonn\u00e9s, beaucoup de gens mourant soit en prison, soit imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9s. Pendant que les hommes dans la for\u00eat r\u00e9coltaient le caoutchouc, leurs femmes \u00e9taient outrag\u00e9es, maltrait\u00e9es ou enlev\u00e9es par les sentinelles  L\u2019histoire de l\u2019ABIR dans ces r\u00e9gions-ci est une histoire d\u2019oppression, de sang vers\u00e9 et d\u2019iniquit\u00e9. Il lui sera bien difficile d\u2019expier ses torts envers la population. This work of vulgarization and spreading of the Casement Report continued until 1906 when two major works vulgarized the commission report and thereby made it available to a much wider audience. The first of these major works was by liberal F\u00e9licien Cattier, Professor at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles; the other was by Father Vermeersch, a Jesuit. Interestingly, the vulgarization of the report came from two political strands\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014that were at the time staunch supporters of the Congo Free State. Father Vermeersch\u2019s book introduced catholic opinion to the possibility that the anti-Congo campaigns were not simply an attack against the Free State by Protestant missionaries. The annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium soon became a most viable solution. The proposal of annexation was taken so seriously that, led by Vandervelde, the debates were reopened on the Congo question in February 1906. Cattier\u2019s book and the commission report became the touchstones to start reforming the regime of the Congo Free State. During the discussion on the annexation of the Congo, references to Casement were rare, just as were those to Morel. A few days before the annexation in October 1908, Vandervelde once again emphasized the importance of the consul in this thorny issue. b.1910-1914: The Casement Report and the Putumayo Atrocities After his report on the CFS, Casement served as consul in various parts of the world, including Lisbon, the Brazilian port of Santos, followed by S\u00e3o Paulo, at the mouth of the Amazon. In July 1910, Edward Grey insisted that Casement be attached to a commission going to investigate reports of atrocities on the Putumayo River of the upper Amazon. What Casement found there was another oppressive regime. Agents of this regime, reported Casement, administrated inhumane treatment on the native population. Back in Britain, in January 1911, Casement submitted his detailed and damning report to the Foreign Secretary. The British government decided in July 1912 to publish Casement\u2019s report. It was subsequently published in the Belgian\n\nquestion: What did the Stokes Affair lead to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1043}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Through the lens of the Putumayo Report, new light is shed on a number of interesting remarks on the Casement Report. When the Putumayo Report was commented on in Belgium in July 1912, the status of the CFS had evolved. The annexation of the Congo in 1908 as a colony of Belgium, known as the Belgian Congo, along with the King\u2019s death in 1909, had changed the situation completely. Belgium put L\u00e9opold II on a pedestal and the episode of the red rubber was erased from people\u2019s memory. A striking example of this change in perception is the case of Emile Vandervelde: the man who exposed and condemned the atrocities of the Congo during the Parliamentary debates and in heated and passionate articles in Le Peuple became, after his trip to the Congo, a fervent supporter of the colony. His policies now connected socialism and colonialism by arguing that both these movements had the moral obligation of guardianship towards the less developed people. The socialist leader then distanced himself from Morel\u2019s campaign. From the Belgian perspective, however, the Putumayo Report fell at a bad time. In 1910-12, when the Congo Free State became the Belgian Congo, its new colonial administration reacted rather poorly to the allegations about the inability of the Belgians to rule the Congo. For the authorities of the newly-created Belgian Congo, England froze interference by pursuing its consular inquiries into the Congo. Through a fear either imagined or real, the Congo remained for the Belgian authorities a coveted colony. Important discussions were taking place between Lalaing and Grey regarding the recognition by the English of the annexation of the Congo Free State to Belgium. When Casement returned from Putumayo, Count Lalaing highlighted the similar attitude that London adopted towards the Congo Free State and the Peruvian government.  Upon publication of the Putumayo Report, the British press made allusions to the Congo case and stirred up ancient feuds between the two countries. The ambassador very much regretted that the press made \u201callusions aussi blessantes qu\u2019exag\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ancien r\u00e9gime Congolais.\u201d  If The Times mentioned that the situation was worse in Peru, Morel insisted in The Economist that nothing could be compared to the CFS. The annexation was finally recognized the following year, and Grey\u2019s speech on that occasion was welcomed by L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the clearing of reckless attacks. In contrast, the Belgian government deemed that England was much too slow in her recognition of the Belgian Congo. If Lalaing highlighted similar reactions on the part of London towards both of Casement reports, the press adopted a totally different stance to Casement\u2019s Putumayo Report. There were no connections established in the papers about the fact that both reports were from the same pen. The press treated these two reports as totally distinct. Another striking difference was that, while the Casement Report was passionately debated and condemned as false (apart from a few) between 1903 and 1906, the Putumayo Report was presented in a detached manner, very matter-of-factly. The reports in Le Soir and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle took the form of factual lists of atrocities committed by the Peruvian Amazon Company on the indigenous population to collect rubber in all their excruciating details. The comparison of the treatment established two important facts: the first one was that there was indeed a complete amnesia in Belgium about the Congo atrocities. Not one reference was made to Casement, the damned and criticized author of the report on the CFS. And secondly, the difference in treatments highlighted the fact that, between 1903 and 1906, there was a passionate debate about the Congo question. The Casement Report, contrary to what Jules Marchal argues, did trigger interest and passionate debate among the Belgian population. c.1914-1918: The Casement Report and the Great War At the time of the outbreak of the Great War, Casement was retired. This retirement, however, was rather short lived. He turned his interest to Ireland\u2019s political turmoil. In 1914 Ireland, different political factions opposed each other on the issue of Home Rule, which would grant a Dublin government for the whole of Ireland. Unionists opposed the bill because they feared a loss of power; constitutional nationalists and John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, supported the Home Rule bill. To put actions into words, he urged Irishmen to enlist in the British army. Within the nationalists, there was a more radical Republican wing that included well-known names such as Patrick Pearse, Thomas Clarke, Sean McDermott, and\u2026Roger Casement. The former British consul had decided to fight alongside the republicans in the hope of the birth of an independent Ireland, free and not part of any Empire. Casement sought to obtain German support for a rebellion against English rule\u2014the Easter Rising. Shortly before\n\nquestion: What did the Stokes Affair lead to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1107}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was convicted and executed for treason. Casement\u2019s involvement in these republican activities ultimately had a profound effect on the perspective of the Casement Report within Belgium. There were very few official responses to Casement\u2019s fate. Casement\u2019s involvement in the Easter Rising and his subsequent arrest were barely mentioned by the Belgian embassy in London. The Belgian Congo\u2019s mother country was deemed at this time \u201cpoor little Belgium,\u201d a country that the British needed to rescue after the German invasion of its territory. Despite the laudatory speeches and gestures of support, King Albert and the Belgian government were deeply concerned by the German occupation of Belgium and by the possible damage to the integrity of the national territory both of Belgium and of the Belgian Congo after the conflict. In this time of great crisis for Belgium, Casement\u2019s trial was not an object of interest for Belgian officials. Instead of going back to ancient feuds, the ambassador, Paul Hymans, worked towards the organization of two Anglo-Belgian events that would demonstrate the intimate friendship between the two countries. Success was complete, and Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, in his speeches, glorified the Belgian attitude. By coincidence, the two events took place shortly before and after Casement\u2019s execution on August 3, 1916. Then, too, the execution of the former consul was not exploited by Belgian officials. Hymans\u2019 personality played a big role in that fact. Following the publication of Morel\u2019s Truth and the War at the end of August, part of the public opinion\u2014including British\u2014was struck by the coincidence between Morel\u2019s statements in 1911, in which he advocated for an Anglo-German rapprochement on the basis of the sharing of the Congo, and the revelations at Casement\u2019s trial. From there emerged the idea that Morel and Casement were agents in the service of Germany, whose aim it was to create tensions between Belgium and Great Britain on the Congo question. This development, however, was rejected by the ambassador, who trusted history to decide on the issue. However, three important elements reversed the situation completely: first, the creation of a propaganda division at the ministry of the colonies in 1916; second, Morel\u2019s condemnation in 1917; and third, the need to look victimized at the peace conference. Now Minister of Foreign affairs, Hymans signed a note for the diplomats, prepared by Octave Louwers. If Louwers, as a young magistrate in the Congo Free State, denounced L\u00e9opold II as a scoundrel, the minister\u2019s adviser suggested not to be intimidated by the memory of the \u201catrocities,\u201d because if L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime had not been faultless, its benefits were too long overshadowed by the accusations orchestrated by questionable characters. Sir Herbert Samuel, author of the motion in May 1903, bowed a quarter of a century later in front of the Belgian work that was now at the forefront of progressive and enlightened colonial administrations. The myth that Morel and Casement were agents of Germany resurged throughout the whole period of the Belgian Congo. While there were very few references to Casement\u2019s fate in the official spheres, the press, on the other hand, turned the Casement\u2019s trial and his hanging into its main headlines. Casement was, in the Belgian press, a \u201ctra\u00eetre.\u201d Le Soir, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge reported Casement\u2019s arrest in every detail, branding him as \u201cIrlando-Boche,\u201d \u201cun agent de l\u2019Allemagne\u201d, and \u201cinventeur et le colporteur de l\u2019abominable l\u00e9gende des \u2018mains coup\u00e9es\u2019.\u201d With an ironic twist, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle asked \u201co\u00f9 sont ces belles d\u00e9clamations sur les atrocit\u00e9s congolaise, sur le \u2018caoutchouc rouge,\u2019 les vibrantes tirades humanitaires?\u201d The journalist compared Casement to a character in a Charles Dickens novel: Il y a dans un roman de Dickens une brave dame qui passe son temps \u00e0 s\u2019occuper des indig\u00e8nes de Borrisbola-Ghaa sur la c\u00f4te d\u2019Afrique\u2014mais qui oublie totalement l\u2019existence de son mari et de ses enfants. Le sieur Casement rappelle cette bonne femme, avec l\u2019infamie en plus. Casement\u2019s friendship with Germany was outlined in every article.

The latter was in favor of Casement\u2019s suggestion to build an army from Irish prisoners of war to fight for the Irish cause. Casement\u2019s treason threw into doubt all the allegations that he made in 1903 on the Belgian administration of the CFS. In light of these events, the Casement Report was completely nullified by the Belgian society of the Great War. Casement\u2019s alignment with Germany was, to the papers, further proof that this man was not to be trusted and that his report was just a pack of lies. In Le Soir, for instance, dating back to April 1916, Casement\u2019s report was fully discredited: \u201cLa plupart des horribles \u00e9pisodes racont\u00e9s par cet \u00e9trange consul \u00e9taient exag\u00e9r\u00e9s et en partie invent\u00e9s  Il \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 ma\u00eetre dans l\u2019art de truquer les photographies et de falsifier les documents.\u201d British attitudes completely changed with regards to the Casement Report. The British that had proclaimed for all the world to hear the atrocities that were taking place in the Belgian Congo now apologized for being \u201cduped\u201d by the traitor Casement. Le Soir reported that the British press expressed \u201cun vif regret d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 entrain\u00e9e par ce tra\u00eetre.\u201d Casement\u2019s report was now being perceived a tool to create a gap between Belgium and England for the benefit of Germany. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle wrote passionately about this particular issue: Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de brouiller la Belgique et l\u2019Angleterre, et, par surcroit la France et l\u2019Angleterre? Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats politiques de l\u2019Allemagne, int\u00e9r\u00eats continentaux et int\u00e9r\u00eats coloniaux compris? Il est grand temps que la r\u00e9putation de la Belgique \u2018calomni\u00e9e\u2019 dans cette affaire, soit enfin r\u00e9habilit\u00e9e. In the light of these events, Belgian papers presented the Belgian Congo colony as being coveted by Germany. Le Soir, for one, wrote that \u201cMorel et Casement  travaillaient \u00e0 d\u00e9pouiller la Belgique de sa colonie, au profit de l\u2019Allemagne.\u201d All in all Casement\u2019s treason was, for Belgium and the Belgian Congo, holy bread. L\u00e9opold II and his humanitarian work in the Congo was now restored to good faith. L\u00e9opold II got his revenge, and the Belgian Congo, former Congo Free State, was reestablished among the model colonies in Africa. L\u00e9opold\u2019s \u0153uvre was \u201cveng\u00e9e des accusations du tra\u00eetre Casement,\u201d  wrote Le Soir. For those living in 1905 and 1906, when L\u00e9opold II was \u201cl\u2019objet d\u2019inf\u00e2mes outrages dans la presse \u00e9trang\u00e8re,\u201d these revelations were \u201cune \u00e9clatante revanche et une grande consolation.\u201d \u201cQuelle revanche,\u201d wrote Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, \u201cpour L\u00e9opold II et nos h\u00e9ros africains que les campagnes des complices de la barbarie allemande avaient r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire passer, m\u00eame aux yeux de certains de leurs compatriotes, pour de monstrueux criminels.\u201d III. Conclusion Roger Casement\u2019s report and the end of the CFS are considered today to be intrinsically connected to one another, the former leading to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo. This connection, however, as this paper hopes to have shown, is much more in the realm of myth than it is of actual historical reality. The direct link that exists in popular imagination between the report and the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo is a simplification of the role and impact of Casement\u2019s denunciatory report. Casement\u2019s report is first and foremost the work of an emphatic man who wished to denounce the suffering of the Congolese population. In Great Britain and the Anglophone world as a whole, the report had a great impact upon both the political and popular spheres of the country. Such an impact can be understood within the recurrent charges of maladministration that took place on L\u00e9opold\u2019s territory since 1895. Casement\u2019s report kindled the spark to this fire of\n\nquestion: What did the Stokes Affair lead to?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1020}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In Belgium, however, the role and impact of the Casement Report was of a totally different nature. Political opinions oscillated between rejection of the report and support for its humanitarian concerns. Belgian socialists and liberals never hesitated in condemning the abuse taking place in the CFS, while the catholics cast a great shadow over the truth and veracity of Casement\u2019s statements. The use of a foreign report, however, was not acceptable within Belgian politics and an enquiry commission was established. The debate, therefore, was not on the basis of Casement\u2019s report, but rather on that of the enquiry commission. The Casement Report was but a piece in the domino effect that led to the annexation of the Congo to Belgium. Even after the annexation, the relentless attack upon L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo awakened Belgium\u2019s national pride. As a reaction there was a phenomenon of collective amnesia concerning the abuse, and L\u00e9opold II was put on a pedestal. The outbreak of the First World War resuscitated the figure of Roger Casement in yet another perspective. The Great War was a time of propaganda where partial truths are turned into patriotic dogmas. With the growing feeling of Belgian national pride, the country framed itself sympathetically with the hanging of Roger Casement by the British authorities for treason. The papers once again insisted on Casement\u2019s report as a pack of lies intended to steal the Congo away from Belgium. Today still, former Belgian colonials look upon Casement\u2019s report as exaggerated and his campaign as mainly anti-Belgian. In the end, the anti-Congo campaign created a dualistic representation of the CFS, one that has been taken up in literature by Adam Hochschild and Mario Vargas Llosa, both of whom represent Casement as the martyr of the humanitarian cause. This image of Casement as a martyr cannot be applied to Roger Casement, who was, and will always remain, a privileged witness of L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo.

As the State asserted more and more its vitality and progress, the campaign will keep on growing, relying on some specific and isolated cases to invoke humanity as a pretext to conceal the true objective of their envy.

This report was instrumental in Leopold finally relinquishing his private holdings in Africa. Leopold had held ownership of the Congolese state since 1885, granted to him by the Berlin Conference, in which he exploited its natural resources (mostly rubber) for his own private wealth. Through intercepted letters, Captain Hubert-Joseph Lothaire, the commander of the Congo Free State forces in the Ituri-campaign, learned that Charles Stokes (born in Dublin) was on his way from German East Africa to sell weapons to the Zanzibari slavers in the eastern Congo region. Stokes was arrested and taken to Captain Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a Drumhead court-martial. Stokes was found guilty of selling guns, gunpowder and detonators to the Congo Free State's Afro-Arab enemies. On 14 January 1895 he was sentenced to death and was hanged the next day (hoisted on a tree). To Lothaire, Charles Stokes was no more than a criminal whose hanging was fully justified. Lord Salisbury, the British Prime Minister at the time, commented that if Stokes was in league with Arab slave-trading, then 'he deserved hanging'. Sir John Kirk, for years the British Consul in Zanzibar, remarked that \"he was no loss to us, although he was an honest man.\" The news of Stokes' execution was received with indifference by the British Foreign Office. When the German ambassador asked Sir Thomas H. Sanderson, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether the British government planned to take any steps regarding the execution of this \"well-known character\", Sanderson wrote: \"I do not quite understand why the Germans are pressing us.\" In August 1895, the attention of the British press was drawn to this case by Lionel Decle, a journalist for the Pall Mall Gazette. The press began to report on these events in great detail, The Daily News emphasized 'bloodthirsty precipitation', The Times a 'painful and disgraceful death', The Liverpool Daily Post 'horrified amazement through the British race', The Daily Telegraph 'death like a dog', adding, \"Have we all been wrong in believing that the most audacious foreigner \u2013 not to speak of any savage chief \u2013 would think once, twice and even trice, before he laid hands on a subject of Queen Victoria?\". As a result, the case became an international incident, better known as the Stokes Affair. Together, Britain and Germany pressured the Congo Free State to put Lothaire on trial, which they eventually did, a first trial was held in the city of Boma. The Free State paid compensation to the British (150,000 francs) and Germans (100,000 francs) and made it impossible by decree to impose martial law or death sentences on European citizens. Stokes's body was returned to his family. Lothaire was acquitted twice, first in April 1896 by a tribunal in Boma. In August 1896, the appeal was confirmed in Brussels by the Supreme Court of Congo, paving the way for the rehabilitation of Lothaire. The Stokes Affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State. It also damaged the reputation of King Leopold II of Belgium as a benevolent despot, which he had cultivated with so much effort. The case helped encourage the foundation of the Congo Reform Association \u2013 by Roger Casement and E. D. Morel \u2013 which in its turn put pressure on the Belgian government, which helped lead to the annexation of the Congo Free State by the Belgian state in 1908. For many years prior to the Casement Report there were reports from the Congo alleging widespread abuses and exploitation of the native population. In 1895, the situation was reported to Dr Henry Grattan Guinness (1861\u20131915), a missionary doctor. He had established the Congo-Balolo Mission in 1889, and was promised action by King Leopold later in 1895, but nothing changed. H. R. Fox-Bourne of the Aborigines' Protection Society had published Civilisation in Congoland in 1903, and the journalist E. D. Morel also wrote several articles about the Leopoldian government's behaviour in the Congo Free State. On 20 May 1903 a motion by the Liberal Herbert Samuel was debated in the British House of Commons, resulting in this resolution:... That the Government of the Congo Free State having, at its inception, guaranteed to the Powers that its Native subjects should be governed with humanity, and that no trading monopoly or privilege should be permitted within its dominions, this House requests His Majesty's Government to confer with the other Powers, signatories of the Berlin General Act by virtue of which the Congo\n\nquestion: Why did the Casement Report create an international furor?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Stokes Affair formed an international incident.", "usage": 1148}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Subsequently, the British consul at Boma in the Congo, the Irishman Roger Casement was instructed by Balfour's government to investigate. His report was published in 1904, confirmed Morel's accusations, and had a considerable impact on public opinion. Casement met and became friends with Morel just before the publication of his report in 1904 and realized that he had found the ally he had sought. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organization for dealing specifically with the Congo question. With Casement's and Dr. Guinness's assistance, he set up and ran the Congo Reform Association, which worked to end Leopold's control of the Congo Free State. Branches of the association were established as far away as the United States. The Casement Report comprises forty pages of the Parliamentary Papers, to which is appended another twenty pages of individual statements gathered by Casement as Consul, including several detailing grim tales of killings, mutilations, kidnappings and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo Administration of King Leopold. Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1885, under which much of Africa had been partitioned. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. While the Report was issued as a Command paper in 1904, and was laid before the Houses of Parliament, the original was not published in full until 1985, in an annotated book by two Belgian professors of the history of colonialism. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist political leader and statesman Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold II to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives). Despite these findings, Leopold managed to retain personal control of the Congo until 1908, when the Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration as the Belgian Congo. However the final push came from Leopold's successor King Albert I, and in 1912 the Congo Reform Association had the satisfaction of dissolving itself.\n\nquestion: Why did the Casement Report create an international furor?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "It confirmed accusations of atrocities in the Congo Free State.", "usage": 635}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

R. Fox-Bourne of the Aborigines' Protection Society had published Civilisation in Congoland in 1902, and the journalist E. D. Morel also wrote several articles about the Leopoldian government's behaviour in the Congo Free State. In 1903, two years after the death of King Leopold's cousin Queen Victoria, the British House of Commons passed a critical resolution on the Congo. Subsequently, the British consul at Boma in the Congo, the Irishman Roger Casement, was instructed to investigate. His report published in 1904, which confirmed Morel's accusations, had a considerable impact on public opinion. Casement met and became friends with Morel just before the publication of his report in 1904 and realized that he had found the ally he had sought. Casement convinced Morel to establish an organization for dealing specifically with the Congo question. With Casement's assistance, he set up and ran the Congo Reform Association, which worked to end Leopold's control of the Congo Free State. Branches of the association were established as far away as the United States. Emile Vandervelde The Casement Report comprises forty pages of the Parliamentary Papers, to which is appended another twenty pages of individual statements gathered by Casement as Consul, including several detailing grim tales of killings, mutilations, kidnappings and cruel beatings of the native population by soldiers of the Congo Administration of King Leopold. Copies of the Report were sent by the British government to the Belgian government as well as to nations who were signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1885, under which much of Africa had been partitioned. The British Parliament demanded a meeting of the fourteen signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by socialist leader Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the King's Congolese policy, forced a reluctant Leopold to set up an independent commission of enquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement's report in every detail. This led to the arrest and punishment of officials who had been responsible for murders during a rubber-collection expedition in 1903 (including one Belgian national who was given a five-year sentence for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives). Despite these findings, Leopold managed to retain personal control of the Congo until 1908, when the Parliament of Belgium annexed the Congo Free State and took over its administration as the Belgian Congo. However the final push came from Leopold's successor King Albert I, and in 1912 the Congo Reform Association had the satisfaction of dissolving itself.\n\nquestion: Why did the Casement Report create an international furor?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Casement Report confirmed accusations of human rights abuses and exploitation in the Congo Free State, leading to international outrage.", "usage": 846}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

The report publicly denounced the atrocious systems of the rubber terror which forced Africans to extract the rubber from lianas to the profit of the State or concessionaries. Published in Great Britain in 1904, the report caused great outrage. The impact of the report in Belgium, however, has been so far underexplored. William Roger Louis mentions the importance of this report to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime and to Belgium\u2019s takeover of the Congo. This position, however, is contested by Jules Marchal, who has stated in his work that \u201cthe king had not to fear a reaction from the Belgian public who showed little interest in the Congo.\u201d None of these studies, however, have looked in depth at the impact of the publication of the Casement Report on the official reactions and on popular opinion in Belgium. This paper seeks to do just that. Keywords Roger Casement, King L\u00e9opold II, Congo Free State, Casement Report, Belgian Congo, Belgium, Commission of Inquiry, anti-Congo campaigns Introduction In July 1903, Roger Casement, as part of his duties as British consul, set out on a journey to the rubber regions of the Congo Free State (henceforth \u201cCFS\u201d). In February 1904, the publication of his report on the harsh living conditions of the indigenous population aroused much indignation within official and popular spheres in Great Britain. Very quickly, Casement and Edmund Morel founded the Congo Reform Association (henceforth \u201cC.R.A\u201d) and proclaimed their goal of putting an end to King L\u00e9opold II\u2019s Congo. And thus started one of the first humanitarian campaigns, one which, in spite of the end of the Congo Free State and its annexation to Belgium in 1908, continued its efforts until 1913. In the wake of the publication of the report in Great Britain, two very different courses of action were put in place. The first was official: the governmental spheres aimed at keeping the balance among European nations and expressing courtesy towards allied countries. The second course of action concerned public opinion: the C.R.A stepped up their propaganda against the CFS in order to stir the hearts of the British people into action. The role of the Casement Report was very different in each case. Officially, Great Britain used it in the hopes of reopening the Congo question with the signatories of the Berlin Conference. For the British people, the Report was certainly the trigger for the creation of the C.R.A but was also quickly replaced both by testimonies, primarily of Protestant missionaries, and by Morel\u2019s multiple books and pamphlets on the ill-treatment of the indigenous population. If studies on Casement\u2019s life and actions are manifold, the analysis of the reception of Casement\u2019s report and its impact in Belgium are important and, yet, relatively neglected research areas. In addition, the passing remarks on the subject are largely contradictory. William Roger Louis argues that the report was a major factor in the end of the CFS: \u201cCasement\u2019s report and his establishment of the C.R.A.,\u201d writes Louis, \u201cwere two feats that contributed greatly to the eventual downfall of the Leopoldian system, and the annexation of the Congo by Belgium.\u201d Jules Marchal, however, expresses the opinion that, because the Belgian population showed \u201clittle interest in the Congo,\u201d its impact was de-facto insignificant. In his contribution, he nevertheless recognizes that the real impact of the Casement Report and its role in the end of the CFS can only be really understood and evaluated by looking at the official and popular spheres within Belgium itself. It is true that the Congolese question was, first and foremost, an issue within Belgian domestic political affairs. Since 1890, Belgium was heir to L\u00e9opold II; and, since 1901, the Belgian Parliament could have started the annexation procedure of the Congo Free State to Belgium, had it wished to do so. Internationally, too, this right was never questioned either by England or by the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference. If the anti-Congo campaign led by the C.R.A. is still remembered elsewhere today, in Belgium itself, it had very little impact, and this is for two main reasons: first, while Casement and Morel\u2019s campaign was a pressurizing factor in Great Britain, it was much less so in Belgium. And second, in a very practical sense, the working language of the report was English, which was at that time not particularly well-known in Belgium. And yet, by criticizing the CFS, Casement and Morel were attacking the King, something that did not leave the\n\nquestion: Why did the Casement Report create an international furor?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Casement Report created an international furor because it exposed the brutal treatment of the indigenous population in the Congo Free State.", "usage": 1108}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Since its independence in 1830, Belgium has had a constitutional monarchy. The country has a rather liberal constitution, affording many freedoms to its citizens. One of its articles guarantees the freedom of press and stipulates that censorship can never be established, thereby engendering a quasi-absolute freedom of the press. Belgian society at the time of L\u00e9opold II was organized into different segments, each with their own ideology. There were three pillars at that time: catholic, liberal, and socialist. Each pillar had its own social institutions, including distinct political parties and newspapers. For each of these pillars, the chosen mouthpiece was the press. Political parties and newspapers were so tied up together that it was not uncommon to find parliamentarians, party leaders, and ministers as writers or newspaper editors. For example, the leader of the socialist party, Emile Vandervelde, was one of the columnists for Le Peuple; and the leader of the catholic party, Charles Woeste, was the editor-in-chief of La Revue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Circulation was good, given that about 68% of the population was literate in 1900. For these reasons, we believe that the press is an excellent indicator of the popular opinions of each of the different pillars towards the Casement Report, the anti-Congo campaigns, and the annexation of Congo to Belgium. For this article, we have chosen Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle as the representative of the catholic pillar, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the liberal mouthpiece, and Le Peuple as the expression of the socialist viewpoint. We have also included in the corpus Le Soir which defines itself as a neutral paper. Those press publications subsidized by the CFS such as La Belgique coloniale, L\u2019Etoile belge, and Le Petit Bleu have not been included in this study because their influence was not great on Belgian popular opinion. The debate on the CFS is not limited to popular reactions, and therefore we also consider the official reactions. At the time of the debate Brussels was the capital of two distinct states: Belgium and the CFS, which were only linked together by the figure of King L\u00e9opold II. Thus we scrutinize and discuss at length the reactions of both the Belgian officials and the Congolese administration. The Casement Report as a whole can be read as a travelogue. Casement wrote down his experiences and the personal testimonies of the people he met on his journey. And contrary to popular belief, the Casement Report is not a passionate denunciation of the CFS but rather a well-balanced one. Casement was not, in other words, denouncing at all costs. As Louis explains, the report is \u201cnot a verbally scathing denunciation of the Congo administration,\u201d but rather, it is \u201cunderstated.\u201d Finesse and nuance characterize Casement\u2019s approach. He recognizes the benefits of the Belgian presence on Congolese soil\u2014for instance, in the field of infrastructure\u2014and shares his concerns about the treatment of the indigenous population. The consul was horrified at the drastic depopulation of some areas, which he interpreted either as the outbreak of sleeping sickness, frequent in an African context, or the result of heavy migration to the French Congo. Casement describes the forced labor at the different concessionaries, including Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anversoise and Anglo-Belgian India Rubber company (hencefore Abir), and gives a precise description of the tax system that enslaved the population. In that particular context, he tells the story of a teenage boy, Epondo, who was missing a left hand. The boy\u2019s explanation was that his hand was cut off by a sentry, a Congolese auxiliary employed by the concessionary. Casement personally investigated his case and sent the sentry before the authorities. Casement had, of course, no way of assessing the accuracy of Epondo\u2019s testimony, an issue that will be used against him in later stages. Nevertheless, the Report remains a mirror to the situation of the CFS in 1903. This paper looks at the role and impact of the Casement Report in Belgium. Its assessment within Belgium will help us to understand the part that it played in the end of the CFS and the development of the Belgian Congo. Ultimately, we wish to complicate the connection between Casement\u2019s report and the end of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo, which up to this point has been overly simplified. The analysis is divided into three parts. The first part looks at those reactions immediately following the publication of the report, which range from outright hostility to passionate support for the humanitarian cause. This first part also looks at the official responses from the CFS and the inquiry commission set up by the King, which together constitute the official documents of the debate. Casement\u2019s report then comes back in 1912 when the consul wrote another damning condemnation on his\n\nquestion: Why did the Casement Report create an international furor?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The shocking details of forced labor and atrocities described in the report led to international furor.", "usage": 1121}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Of particular interest are the widely differing reactions to it. The last part of the analysis looks at the reception of the Casement Report at the time of the First World War, a time of propaganda and mythical representations. At this time, Belgians had yet another take on the Casement Report. The anti-Congo campaigns were relentless at this point, pushing Belgian citizens to support the King and to deny the atrocities that had taken place. In addition Casement had been hanged for treason by the British. These two factors combined led to a complete disavowal of the Report. I. Edmund Morel\u2019s Campaign and the Casement Report (1903-1904) The name of Roger Casement and the anti-Congo campaigns are inextricably linked. While being a document among many others condemning King L\u00e9opold\u2019s kingdom, Casement\u2019s report remains a touchstone in anti-Congo campaigns. The intensity of the reactions to the report can only be understood by looking at the context of the creation of the CFS and what it stood for. In his burning ambitions of expanding abroad, L\u00e9opold II did not have the support of the financial and political elites of the country. The different parliamentary majorities saw in this expansion project the endangerment of Belgium\u2019s neutrality, and/or a real danger for Belgium\u2019s neutrality. For the liberals, the immediate priority was to keep good relations with neighboring countries, mainly for the development of the economy. In opposition, the socialists denounced the exploitation of the masses both in the industries and in the colonies. And Belgium\u2019s catholic government of the time, while it did not want to get involved in the Congo question, welcomed the idea of establishing catholic missions abroad. Faced with such opposition, L\u00e9opold II decided to act as an individual. In 1870, the King took up the argument of the civilizing mission. His reputation as a philanthropist had been consistently growing both in Belgium and abroad. The King\u2019s humanitarian interest found echo in the Anglophone world that was thoroughly involved with the abolitionist cause. In other words, the civilizing mission had truly become the leitmotiv of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. For this reason, among others, the CFS would be under the gaze of international public opinion. At the outset, L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan was to operate without imposing customs or import duties. While this option proved to be positive for the creation of the CFS, financially it was untenable\u2014so untenable, in fact, that the King was forced to invest his own finances into the CFS. Debts kept growing and, on the verge of bankruptcy, the King decided to drastically change the economic policy of the CFS. Gone were the days of barter with the local population. Emphasis was now on the harvesting of goods, more specifically rubber and ivory. But this new system also led to the use of violence: the military force now came into play to make sure that the demands of harvesting were met. And with the use of the military force came a plethora of violent acts and atrocities, including rape, murder, and mutilation. The atrocities linked to the rubber trade were then not a sought-out politic of L\u00e9opold II, but rather an indirect consequence of his economic position. In 1895, a campaign\u2014in The Times, among others\u2014denounced the abuse in the CFS. Hearing of these allegations, the Belgian King promised changes and reforms and, in that way, managed to keep the reputation of the CFS intact\u2014that is, until the arrival on the scene of Edmund Morel. Hired by Sir Alfred Jones, business partner of L\u00e9opold II, Morel used his pen to defend the cause of ship-owners in Liverpool. As a clerk for the company Morel noticed that the ships leaving Belgium for the Congo carried guns, chains, and explosives but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the CFS came back full of valuable products such as rubber and ivory. This discovery led him to understand the exploitative nature of the regime. To defend the welfare of Africans, Morel launched his own newspaper\u2014The West African Mail\u2014to denounce the brutal exploitation of the natives. This new publication immediately drew the attention of the CFS. The association of Jones and Morel later fuelled the Belgian fantasy that claimed the merchants of Liverpool were plotting against the country. Morel played an important role in the adoption\u2014by the House of Commons on May 20, 1903\u2014of a motion suggested by British Liberal M.P. Herbert Samuel on the Congo question. Samuel\u2019s motion, based on humanitarian and economic arguments, hoped to reconvene the signatory powers of the Berlin Conference\u2014including Belgium\u2014to discuss once again the Congolese question. In Belgium, the\n\nquestion: Why did the Casement Report create an international furor?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1100}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  motion created a form of awkwardness and embarrassment, but not much more. Only Emile Vandervelde, emblematic figure of the socialist movement, and Georges Lorand, a liberal progressive politician, made a stand against the scandal that erupted in the CFS. The socialist deputy suggested to Paul de Favereau, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to intervene in order to shed light on the alleged atrocities. This proposal, however, was rejected on the grounds that Belgium cannot intervene in the affairs of another sovereign State. The very few reactions to this British motion reflected the disengagement that Belgium felt towards the Congo question. L\u00e9opold II did not wish to see the Congolese question placed on the agenda of European governments. The King, in a state of denial about the atrocities, considered these allegations as lies to serve a campaign of covetousness of the CFS by the \u201ccorsaire\u201d Morel, part of an attempt of the British to get their hands on the Congo Free State. The King then launched his own counter-propaganda. One of his first initiatives was to encourage the creation of the FEDIBE (La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration pour la Defense des Inter\u00eats Belges \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tranger) and that of its official organ, La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur le Congo. The drafting of these texts were naturally provided by the Congolese administration. Blamed for mistreatment towards the Congolese people, the King planned another initiative: the enactment of a law in October 1903 limiting the mandatory services of the indigenous people to around forty hours of work per month. Finally, the CFS answered the British motion in contemptuous terms suggesting that it was a plot organized by the merchants of Liverpool. The Congolese government did not suspect at this stage that Casement was authorized in September 1902 to make a journey to the Upper Congo. Early in 1903, Casement already gave a report on the inequalities of the system in place within the CFS. In May, he was appointed official investigator, and the Foreign Office, aware of the parliamentary debates on the Congo question, encouraged him to leave on his journey as soon as possible. On June 5, the Consul left Matadi. He followed the river and passed through L\u00e9opoldville (Kinshasa) and Coquilhatville (Mbandaka), two major cities in the CFS, but he also abandoned his river path to penetrate deeper into the African country. He spent three weeks at Lake Matumba (la Ntomba) that is located in the Domaine de la Couronne, personal property of King L\u00e9opold II. He also stayed for five days in Bongandanga, the ABIR station, on the Lopori River. This last week was crucial to Casement, as he thought he had collected enough material for his report. On September 11, he began his journey back to the Lower Congo and left the African continent to return to Europe on November 7th to begin his report. II. Belgian Reactions to the Casement Report a.1903-1906: The Casement Report and its Responses 1.December 1903\u2014Mid-March 1904: The Casement Report The British consul finalized Casement\u2019s report in December 1903, and it was published in February of the following year. The first official reactions were dated two months prior to the publication of the report. They were full of worry, fear, and suspicion. Pending the publication of the report, L\u00e9opold II threatened to reorient his policy to be closer to Germany. The King desperately wanted his hands on the report, and he sent Sir Alfred Jones, his associate in maritime affairs and consul of the CFS in Liverpool, twice to the Foreign Office to get an exclusive copy of it. In this atmosphere of great suspicion about England\u2019s ulterior motives in this report, the Count of Lalaing, who was Belgian ambassador in London, tried his best to reassure the governmental spheres that the English posed no threat to the Congo. To that end, Lalaing repeated the words of Lord Lansdowne that Britain did not wish to own any part of the CFS. And, upon sending the Casement Report to Brussels, Lalaing shared a confidence qualifying the Report\u2019s tone as fairly moderate. Of course, great was the ambassador\u2019s disappointment when the British press blatantly attacked the Congo and presented it on its front page news as hell on earth. In spite of these setbacks, the Belgian ambassador continued to work towards some form of appeasement between the various parties. During a dinner at Buckingham, for instance, he had a discussion with the Duke of Argyll, Edward VII\u2019s brother-in-law, who ultimately listened attentively to his claims. However, the relationship between the two ruling houses had, according to Edward VII, deteriorated, and it was not part of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s plan to improve\n\nquestion: Why did the Casement Report create an international furor?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1108}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

If the evidence is irrelevant to the question, response ONLY with \"NOANS\".\n\ntitle: \"The Casement Report: Exposing Atrocities in the Congo Free State\"\n\nevidence:  it. The King had become, as his close collaborators reveal, rather bitter in his later years, and it had become impossible for him to bear any contradiction. King L\u00e9opold\u2019s response to the Casement Report was vindictive. He warned the signatory members that the response of the CFS to the Casement Report would shed light on these allegations and establish the very circumstances reported by the British consul. His personal conviction was that \u201cles attaques exag\u00e9r\u00e9es de M. Casement contre les agents Congolais\u201d justified the word \u201clibel\u201d used by the Belgian consul in Liverpool, Edouard S\u00e8ve. Reprimanded by Foreign Affairs, S\u00e8ve\u2019s attitude was illustrative of the zeal of certain diplomats who wanted to get noticed by the Royal Palace, diplomats such as Charles Sarol\u00e9a, who directly opposed Morel. By contrast, Sir Alfred Jones adopted a rather different attitude towards the problem and strongly recommended avoiding controversy in relation to the Casement Report. Jones nevertheless remained extremely active in the Congo question and hired a number of people who, under the safe umbrella of neutrality, started conducting a number of counter-investigations. One of these people is Lord Mountmorres, an Irish peer who officially worked for the London journal, The Globe. The Irishman sent a report to the Foreign Office that he later published in book form. In his conclusion, Mountmorres made a case in favor of the Congolese administration. The CFS, he argued, was governed humanely. The blame of these atrocities, he continued in his report, fell on the greedy concessionaries. The CFS did not bear, therefore, more responsibility than any other colonial regime. The Belgian press\u2014except for the socialists\u2014mirrored these official concerns. Except for Le Peuple, most press organizations were highly critical of the Casement Report. Most of their reports were filled with downright hostility. The papers emphasized the only positive point in the report: that of the very much-improved state of the infrastructure and the abolishment of the slave trade. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle stressed \u201cl\u2019\u00e9nergie montr\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s belges\u201d to improve what they called, one of the wildest regions in Africa. The rest of their reports discredited both the man himself and his report. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge saw the report as having \u201cun caract\u00e8re tendencieux,\u201d mainly because Casement\u2019s trip lasted two months only, instead of the six that were officially planned. For the liberal paper, L\u00e9opold II accomplished \u201cune \u0153uvre de civilisation et de progr\u00e8s \u00e0 laquelle nulle autre n\u2019est comparable dans l\u2019ordre colonial.\u201d Le Soir, in an article dating back to December 1903, stated that Casement\u2019s work just amounted to \u201cune campagne de d\u00e9nigrement vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019Etat ind\u00e9pendant.\u201d Casement\u2019s findings relating to cruelty and oppression were directly discredited by referring to the counter-investigation carried out in the immediate aftermath of the publication by Marquis Bosco, judge in the CFS. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, compared Casement\u2019s and Bosco\u2019s findings, arguing in favor of the latter. According to the paper, while the English accused the Europeans of cruelty on the Congolese, Bosco demonstrated that these alleged cases of mutilation dated back more than ten years and therefore could not be the responsibility of Europeans. The discourse around British covetousness of the Congo imbued the newspaper articles. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, for instance, spoke of \u201cparti pris dans les affaires du Congo.\u201d Le Peuple was the only newspaper of those we examined that had another perspective on the Casement Report. The socialist paper presented the findings as facts \u201cdont l\u2019horreur fait fr\u00e9mir\u201d and wrote of \u201ccaoutchouc rouge.\u201d Le Peuple showed its true opposition to the system in the CFS after the publication of the inquiry commission. Reactions to the Casement Report were diverse in 1903. Except for Le Peuple, which stood for equal chances for all, the rest of these reactions\u2014both official and popular\u2014were shown to be quite distrustful of the report, often deeming it an exaggeration or a ploy to reconvene the Berlin Conference and discuss the Congo case. Words like \u201cexaggeration,\u201d \u201csuspicion,\u201d \u201cmistrust,\u201d \u201cBritish covetousness\u201d and \u201chorror\u201d were used to decry what Casement witnessed in and\n\nquestion: Why did the Casement Report create an international furor?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "It contained allegations of atrocities committed by the agents of the Congo Free State.", "usage": 1056}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

It definitely led to passionate reactions among the Belgians, some feeling outrage at what they saw as an attack, and others feeling consternation at the treatment of the native population whom, according to the Berlin Conference, the Europeans were supposed to protect. 2.Mid-March 1904\u2014March 1905: Congo Free State Response The CFS gave its official response to the Casement Report on March 12, 1904. The suggestion made by the Congo Free State to conduct a private investigation into Casement\u2019s allegations\u2014just as Joseph Chamberlain had promised for the Fiji Islands\u2014caught the attention of the Foreign Office. This response, and its idea to launch a private investigation, was well-received by the Foreign Office. Francis Villiers, future British ambassador in Brussels, strongly recommended that this inquiry be led by an international commission. Bound by its statement, the Congo Free State sent three commissioners\u2014a Belgian, an Italian, and a Swiss\u2014to assess the situation in the country between October 1904 and February 1905. Neither Casement nor Morel believed in the efficiency of this commission, whose members were, in some form or other, connected to the King. The findings of the international commission were rather more nuanced than Casement\u2019s report. On the whole, it confirmed that atrocities were being committed on Congolese soil but presented the facts with their grey areas. They clearly established that the Epondo case was an exaggeration, a testimony that Casement failed to verify. The findings also suggested possible explanations for the type of behavior exhibited in the Congo (for example, climate, lack of morals, abuse of power, pressure for results). In general, their findings could be considered as more rational and nuanced than those of the Casement Report. In this period immediately following the Congo Free State response, each paper kept the stance that they had established towards the Casement Report. The Catholic and Liberal press emphasized the arguments that offered a more favorable vision of L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo. Both Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge published the report and were hoping that the response by the CFS would clear up \u201cun malentendu\u201d created by \u201cdes \u00e9l\u00e9ments anglais.\u201d Commenting upon the atrocities, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge wrote that these, which were at first considered as \u201cincontestables,\u201d had now been shown to be refutable. The paper illustrated its claims by means of two examples. First it discussed at length the well-known Epondo case, once the symbol of the oppression of the system and now simply the victim of a hunting accident. And second, in a later article, the paper discussed another mistake made by Casement. Casement had seen a dozen Congolese men travelling in a train carriage from L\u00e9opoldville to Matadi. They were tied up and controlled under the watchful eye of a soldier, leading the consul to believe they were involved in the rubber scandal. In point of fact, these people were a group of men condemned by the Court in Basoko who had come to Matadi to serve their sentence. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge confirmed its full support to the regime in the CFS and expressed its strong disagreement with the idea that the Congo administration led to \u201cun r\u00e9gime syst\u00e9matique de cruaut\u00e9s ou d\u2019oppression.\u201d The paper, nevertheless, acknowledged that some wrongdoings happened in the country, just as they had in any other colony. But then the paper immediately suggested a number of possible suggestions for these acts of cruelty. It argued that when such deeds had been committed, the perpetrators had been severely punished. It then advised its readers to bear in mind the difficulties Belgians had to face in the heart of Africa, a country with more than two hundred languages and where roads had yet to be built. According to L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, the English should have thought \u201caux difficult\u00e9s qui assaillent les officiers au Congo.\u201d It would be easy to condemn, wrote the paper, when \u201con est assis chez soi \u00e0 l\u2019abri du besoin.\u201d The English, therefore, should give some thought \u201c\u00e0 la mentalit\u00e9 de ces hommes bris\u00e9s de corps et d\u2019esprit dans une lutte perp\u00e9tuelle.\u201d Le Soir wrote a number of articles that defended the country against the Casement Report. In its issue of June 30, 1904, the newspaper interviewed Paul Landbeck, an official working in the CFS. Landbeck strongly contested all the allegations of the British consul against the Free State. His view was that the series of atrocities outlined by Casement were carried out fifteen or twenty years ago before the government stepped in to establish law and order. He put the responsibility\n\nquestion: Why did the Casement Report create an international furor?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Casement Report created an international furor due to the reports of atrocities in L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo.", "usage": 1102}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He believed it \u201cimpossible\u201d that the hands were cut off by Europeans. Landbeck further argued that ill-treatment of the natives was severely punished in the CFS, and that there was no exploitation of the natives to collect rubber. There reigns in the Congo, according to the interviewee, \u201cun ordre parfait.\u201d His view was that \u201cl\u2019Etat remplit sa mission.\u201d The Belgian press continued to establish links between the Casement Report and English covetousness of the Congo. L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge believed that the English started their anti-Congo campaigns at the time when the Free State was becoming an extremely prosperous state. The paper held the view that the English blamed the atrocities on the Congo administration with an ulterior motive, that of getting their hands on the Free State: A partir de 1895, le commerce de l\u2019Etat du Congo prend un essor marqu\u00e9, et le chiffre des exportations monte progressivement de 10 millions en 1895 \u00e0 50 millions en 1902. C\u2019est aussi \u00e0 partir d\u2019alors que le mouvement contre l\u2019Etat du Congo se dessine. Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que l\u2019Etat affirmera davantage sa vitalit\u00e9 et ses progr\u00e8s, la campagne ira en s\u2019accentuant, s\u2019appuyant sur quelques cas particuliers et isol\u00e9s pour invoquer des pr\u00e9textes d\u2019humanit\u00e9 et dissimuler le v\u00e9ritable objectif des convoitises qui, dans leur impatience, se sont cependant trahies sous la plume des pamphl\u00e9taires et par la voix de membres de la Chambre des communes, mettant nettement en avant la disparition et le partage de l\u2019Etat du Congo. Le Peuple, however, faithful to its belief in a better treatment for all, continued to fight to expose the atrocities. It disagreed with the response by the Congo Free State and sided with Casement and English views on the issue. In June 1904, Le Peuple, to show its support to Casement, quoted at length three other sources in Sir Charles Dilke, English liberal politician, Sir John Garot, and Count Earl Percy, the British Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Dilke claimed that the Congo Free State was \u201cun enfer sur terre.\u201d Sir John Garot followed suit and argued that the country was \u201cune immense cuve dans laquelle fermentent les atrocit\u00e9s, les oppressions et les cruaut\u00e9s.\u201d The positions established in 1903-1904 continued in the same line of thought. Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle supported the response by the Congo Free State, relieving Belgium from blame in these allegations. The argument of British covetousness gathered momentum as the anti-Congo campaigns continued. Emile Vandervelde and Le Peuple, on the other hand, siding with the Casement Report, were still fighting for the defense of the native population in the Free State. Their campaign to expose the atrocities in the Congo Free State took its full measure in the next phase, in the response to the report of the inquiry commission. 3.March 1905 - November 1905: The Commission Report The inquiry commission came back in March 1905 from the Free State and its report was published in November 1905. Because it was published in the Bulletin Officiel, the official journal of the Congo Free State, this report was not accessible to the masses, but rather to a small minority of learned and interested people invested in the Congo question. In addition to the report\u2019s relative lack of visibility, the celebrations for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Belgian independence stirred up dormant patriotic feelings in Belgium. The two major political parties\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014touted the King\u2019s genius. The politicians were aware that an impressive program of embellishment and aggrandizement of Belgium had been made possible thanks to the Congo. The socialist leader, again bravely challenged the government about the atrocities against the native population but, just like in 1903, his concerns fell on deaf ears. The Congo question was compared by Lorand to the Dreyfus case in France. It had become impossible, according to the Liberal deputy, to treat the Congo question without being accused of treason towards Belgium or of collusion with the merchants of Liverpool. It was therefore of no surprise that these\n\nquestion: Why did the Casement Report create an international furor?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Casement Report created an international furor because it exposed atrocities in the Congo Free State.", "usage": 1081}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Le Soir, L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle corroborated the commission report, and, in their respective newspapers, primarily printed those findings of the commission that could speak for themselves. One newspaper, however, stood out. Le Peuple showed the full measure of its opposition to the Congo system. While Vandervelde\u2019s voice was not heard in the parliamentary debates, he expressed his views in his socialist newspaper. The socialist leader and his newspaper summarized and quoted the Casement Report in the hope of exposing the cruel system of oppression. They called for a \u201ccampagne de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de piti\u00e9.\u201d The paper focused largely on Abir. The argument against the atrocities was all the more striking since Casement\u2019s findings relating to those concessionaries like Abir were confirmed in the commission report. Le Peuple made a point at presenting in detail the atrocities inflicted on the population to collect the rubber. Le Peuple printed the testimony of victims who came to testify in front of the international commission. They heard the stories of families being taken hostage by Abir because the men did not fill their quota of rubber; they were told about the armed sentries threatening the rubber carriers; they heard the stories of horrific corporal punishment, including floggings and lashes with a chicotte against those that did not fulfill their quotas. The paper described \u201cles civilisateurs Congolais\u201d as follows: On tuait sans distinction les femmes inoffensives et les enfants  Tout cela apparemment pour frapper de terreur ce malheureux peuple et le forcer \u00e0 apporter du caoutchouc  Les t\u00e9moins racont\u00e8rent qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient constamment battus avec la chicotte et que leurs femmes et leurs enfants \u00e9taient continuellement emprisonn\u00e9s, beaucoup de gens mourant soit en prison, soit imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9s. Pendant que les hommes dans la for\u00eat r\u00e9coltaient le caoutchouc, leurs femmes \u00e9taient outrag\u00e9es, maltrait\u00e9es ou enlev\u00e9es par les sentinelles  L\u2019histoire de l\u2019ABIR dans ces r\u00e9gions-ci est une histoire d\u2019oppression, de sang vers\u00e9 et d\u2019iniquit\u00e9. Il lui sera bien difficile d\u2019expier ses torts envers la population. This work of vulgarization and spreading of the Casement Report continued until 1906 when two major works vulgarized the commission report and thereby made it available to a much wider audience. The first of these major works was by liberal F\u00e9licien Cattier, Professor at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles; the other was by Father Vermeersch, a Jesuit. Interestingly, the vulgarization of the report came from two political strands\u2014Catholic and Liberal\u2014that were at the time staunch supporters of the Congo Free State. Father Vermeersch\u2019s book introduced catholic opinion to the possibility that the anti-Congo campaigns were not simply an attack against the Free State by Protestant missionaries. The annexation of the Congo as a colony of Belgium soon became a most viable solution. The proposal of annexation was taken so seriously that, led by Vandervelde, the debates were reopened on the Congo question in February 1906. Cattier\u2019s book and the commission report became the touchstones to start reforming the regime of the Congo Free State. During the discussion on the annexation of the Congo, references to Casement were rare, just as were those to Morel. A few days before the annexation in October 1908, Vandervelde once again emphasized the importance of the consul in this thorny issue. b.1910-1914: The Casement Report and the Putumayo Atrocities After his report on the CFS, Casement served as consul in various parts of the world, including Lisbon, the Brazilian port of Santos, followed by S\u00e3o Paulo, at the mouth of the Amazon. In July 1910, Edward Grey insisted that Casement be attached to a commission going to investigate reports of atrocities on the Putumayo River of the upper Amazon. What Casement found there was another oppressive regime. Agents of this regime, reported Casement, administrated inhumane treatment on the native population. Back in Britain, in January 1911, Casement submitted his detailed and damning report to the Foreign Secretary. The British government decided in July 1912 to publish Casement\u2019s report. It was subsequently published in the Belgian\n\nquestion: Why did the Casement Report create an international furor?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "The Casement Report created an international furor due to the detailed and damning account of the atrocities committed in the Congo Free State and on the Putumayo River of the upper Amazon.", "usage": 1081}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Through the lens of the Putumayo Report, new light is shed on a number of interesting remarks on the Casement Report. When the Putumayo Report was commented on in Belgium in July 1912, the status of the CFS had evolved. The annexation of the Congo in 1908 as a colony of Belgium, known as the Belgian Congo, along with the King\u2019s death in 1909, had changed the situation completely. Belgium put L\u00e9opold II on a pedestal and the episode of the red rubber was erased from people\u2019s memory. A striking example of this change in perception is the case of Emile Vandervelde: the man who exposed and condemned the atrocities of the Congo during the Parliamentary debates and in heated and passionate articles in Le Peuple became, after his trip to the Congo, a fervent supporter of the colony. His policies now connected socialism and colonialism by arguing that both these movements had the moral obligation of guardianship towards the less developed people. The socialist leader then distanced himself from Morel\u2019s campaign. From the Belgian perspective, however, the Putumayo Report fell at a bad time. In 1910-12, when the Congo Free State became the Belgian Congo, its new colonial administration reacted rather poorly to the allegations about the inability of the Belgians to rule the Congo. For the authorities of the newly-created Belgian Congo, England froze interference by pursuing its consular inquiries into the Congo. Through a fear either imagined or real, the Congo remained for the Belgian authorities a coveted colony. Important discussions were taking place between Lalaing and Grey regarding the recognition by the English of the annexation of the Congo Free State to Belgium. When Casement returned from Putumayo, Count Lalaing highlighted the similar attitude that London adopted towards the Congo Free State and the Peruvian government.  Upon publication of the Putumayo Report, the British press made allusions to the Congo case and stirred up ancient feuds between the two countries. The ambassador very much regretted that the press made \u201callusions aussi blessantes qu\u2019exag\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ancien r\u00e9gime Congolais.\u201d  If The Times mentioned that the situation was worse in Peru, Morel insisted in The Economist that nothing could be compared to the CFS. The annexation was finally recognized the following year, and Grey\u2019s speech on that occasion was welcomed by L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge as the clearing of reckless attacks. In contrast, the Belgian government deemed that England was much too slow in her recognition of the Belgian Congo. If Lalaing highlighted similar reactions on the part of London towards both of Casement reports, the press adopted a totally different stance to Casement\u2019s Putumayo Report. There were no connections established in the papers about the fact that both reports were from the same pen. The press treated these two reports as totally distinct. Another striking difference was that, while the Casement Report was passionately debated and condemned as false (apart from a few) between 1903 and 1906, the Putumayo Report was presented in a detached manner, very matter-of-factly. The reports in Le Soir and Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle took the form of factual lists of atrocities committed by the Peruvian Amazon Company on the indigenous population to collect rubber in all their excruciating details. The comparison of the treatment established two important facts: the first one was that there was indeed a complete amnesia in Belgium about the Congo atrocities. Not one reference was made to Casement, the damned and criticized author of the report on the CFS. And secondly, the difference in treatments highlighted the fact that, between 1903 and 1906, there was a passionate debate about the Congo question. The Casement Report, contrary to what Jules Marchal argues, did trigger interest and passionate debate among the Belgian population. c.1914-1918: The Casement Report and the Great War At the time of the outbreak of the Great War, Casement was retired. This retirement, however, was rather short lived. He turned his interest to Ireland\u2019s political turmoil. In 1914 Ireland, different political factions opposed each other on the issue of Home Rule, which would grant a Dublin government for the whole of Ireland. Unionists opposed the bill because they feared a loss of power; constitutional nationalists and John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, supported the Home Rule bill. To put actions into words, he urged Irishmen to enlist in the British army. Within the nationalists, there was a more radical Republican wing that included well-known names such as Patrick Pearse, Thomas Clarke, Sean McDermott, and\u2026Roger Casement. The former British consul had decided to fight alongside the republicans in the hope of the birth of an independent Ireland, free and not part of any Empire. Casement sought to obtain German support for a rebellion against English rule\u2014the Easter Rising. Shortly before\n\nquestion: Why did the Casement Report create an international furor?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1110}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He was convicted and executed for treason. Casement\u2019s involvement in these republican activities ultimately had a profound effect on the perspective of the Casement Report within Belgium. There were very few official responses to Casement\u2019s fate. Casement\u2019s involvement in the Easter Rising and his subsequent arrest were barely mentioned by the Belgian embassy in London. The Belgian Congo\u2019s mother country was deemed at this time \u201cpoor little Belgium,\u201d a country that the British needed to rescue after the German invasion of its territory. Despite the laudatory speeches and gestures of support, King Albert and the Belgian government were deeply concerned by the German occupation of Belgium and by the possible damage to the integrity of the national territory both of Belgium and of the Belgian Congo after the conflict. In this time of great crisis for Belgium, Casement\u2019s trial was not an object of interest for Belgian officials. Instead of going back to ancient feuds, the ambassador, Paul Hymans, worked towards the organization of two Anglo-Belgian events that would demonstrate the intimate friendship between the two countries. Success was complete, and Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, in his speeches, glorified the Belgian attitude. By coincidence, the two events took place shortly before and after Casement\u2019s execution on August 3, 1916. Then, too, the execution of the former consul was not exploited by Belgian officials. Hymans\u2019 personality played a big role in that fact. Following the publication of Morel\u2019s Truth and the War at the end of August, part of the public opinion\u2014including British\u2014was struck by the coincidence between Morel\u2019s statements in 1911, in which he advocated for an Anglo-German rapprochement on the basis of the sharing of the Congo, and the revelations at Casement\u2019s trial. From there emerged the idea that Morel and Casement were agents in the service of Germany, whose aim it was to create tensions between Belgium and Great Britain on the Congo question. This development, however, was rejected by the ambassador, who trusted history to decide on the issue. However, three important elements reversed the situation completely: first, the creation of a propaganda division at the ministry of the colonies in 1916; second, Morel\u2019s condemnation in 1917; and third, the need to look victimized at the peace conference. Now Minister of Foreign affairs, Hymans signed a note for the diplomats, prepared by Octave Louwers. If Louwers, as a young magistrate in the Congo Free State, denounced L\u00e9opold II as a scoundrel, the minister\u2019s adviser suggested not to be intimidated by the memory of the \u201catrocities,\u201d because if L\u00e9opold\u2019s regime had not been faultless, its benefits were too long overshadowed by the accusations orchestrated by questionable characters. Sir Herbert Samuel, author of the motion in May 1903, bowed a quarter of a century later in front of the Belgian work that was now at the forefront of progressive and enlightened colonial administrations. The myth that Morel and Casement were agents of Germany resurged throughout the whole period of the Belgian Congo. While there were very few references to Casement\u2019s fate in the official spheres, the press, on the other hand, turned the Casement\u2019s trial and his hanging into its main headlines. Casement was, in the Belgian press, a \u201ctra\u00eetre.\u201d Le Soir, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and L\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance Belge reported Casement\u2019s arrest in every detail, branding him as \u201cIrlando-Boche,\u201d \u201cun agent de l\u2019Allemagne\u201d, and \u201cinventeur et le colporteur de l\u2019abominable l\u00e9gende des \u2018mains coup\u00e9es\u2019.\u201d With an ironic twist, Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle asked \u201co\u00f9 sont ces belles d\u00e9clamations sur les atrocit\u00e9s congolaise, sur le \u2018caoutchouc rouge,\u2019 les vibrantes tirades humanitaires?\u201d The journalist compared Casement to a character in a Charles Dickens novel: Il y a dans un roman de Dickens une brave dame qui passe son temps \u00e0 s\u2019occuper des indig\u00e8nes de Borrisbola-Ghaa sur la c\u00f4te d\u2019Afrique\u2014mais qui oublie totalement l\u2019existence de son mari et de ses enfants. Le sieur Casement rappelle cette bonne femme, avec l\u2019infamie en plus. Casement\u2019s friendship with Germany was outlined in every article.

The latter was in favor of Casement\u2019s suggestion to build an army from Irish prisoners of war to fight for the Irish cause. Casement\u2019s treason threw into doubt all the allegations that he made in 1903 on the Belgian administration of the CFS. In light of these events, the Casement Report was completely nullified by the Belgian society of the Great War. Casement\u2019s alignment with Germany was, to the papers, further proof that this man was not to be trusted and that his report was just a pack of lies. In Le Soir, for instance, dating back to April 1916, Casement\u2019s report was fully discredited: \u201cLa plupart des horribles \u00e9pisodes racont\u00e9s par cet \u00e9trange consul \u00e9taient exag\u00e9r\u00e9s et en partie invent\u00e9s  Il \u00e9tait pass\u00e9 ma\u00eetre dans l\u2019art de truquer les photographies et de falsifier les documents.\u201d British attitudes completely changed with regards to the Casement Report. The British that had proclaimed for all the world to hear the atrocities that were taking place in the Belgian Congo now apologized for being \u201cduped\u201d by the traitor Casement. Le Soir reported that the British press expressed \u201cun vif regret d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 entrain\u00e9e par ce tra\u00eetre.\u201d Casement\u2019s report was now being perceived a tool to create a gap between Belgium and England for the benefit of Germany. Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle wrote passionately about this particular issue: Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de brouiller la Belgique et l\u2019Angleterre, et, par surcroit la France et l\u2019Angleterre? Ne s\u2019agissait-il pas de servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats politiques de l\u2019Allemagne, int\u00e9r\u00eats continentaux et int\u00e9r\u00eats coloniaux compris? Il est grand temps que la r\u00e9putation de la Belgique \u2018calomni\u00e9e\u2019 dans cette affaire, soit enfin r\u00e9habilit\u00e9e. In the light of these events, Belgian papers presented the Belgian Congo colony as being coveted by Germany. Le Soir, for one, wrote that \u201cMorel et Casement  travaillaient \u00e0 d\u00e9pouiller la Belgique de sa colonie, au profit de l\u2019Allemagne.\u201d All in all Casement\u2019s treason was, for Belgium and the Belgian Congo, holy bread. L\u00e9opold II and his humanitarian work in the Congo was now restored to good faith. L\u00e9opold II got his revenge, and the Belgian Congo, former Congo Free State, was reestablished among the model colonies in Africa. L\u00e9opold\u2019s \u0153uvre was \u201cveng\u00e9e des accusations du tra\u00eetre Casement,\u201d  wrote Le Soir.

Conclusion Roger Casement\u2019s report and the end of the CFS are considered today to be intrinsically connected to one another, the former leading to the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo. This connection, however, as this paper hopes to have shown, is much more in the realm of myth than it is of actual historical reality. The direct link that exists in popular imagination between the report and the end of King L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo is a simplification of the role and impact of Casement\u2019s denunciatory report. Casement\u2019s report is first and foremost the work of an emphatic man who wished to denounce the suffering of the Congolese population. In Great Britain and the Anglophone world as a whole, the report had a great impact upon both the political and popular spheres of the country. Such an impact can be understood within the recurrent charges of maladministration that took place on L\u00e9opold\u2019s territory since 1895. Casement\u2019s report kindled the spark to this fire of\n\nquestion: Why did the Casement Report create an international furor?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Casement's alignment with Germany led to the belief that his report was a pack of lies and made the British apologize for being \"duped\" by him.

In Belgium, however, the role and impact of the Casement Report was of a totally different nature. Political opinions oscillated between rejection of the report and support for its humanitarian concerns. Belgian socialists and liberals never hesitated in condemning the abuse taking place in the CFS, while the catholics cast a great shadow over the truth and veracity of Casement\u2019s statements. The use of a foreign report, however, was not acceptable within Belgian politics and an enquiry commission was established. The debate, therefore, was not on the basis of Casement\u2019s report, but rather on that of the enquiry commission. The Casement Report was but a piece in the domino effect that led to the annexation of the Congo to Belgium. Even after the annexation, the relentless attack upon L\u00e9opold\u2019s Congo awakened Belgium\u2019s national pride. As a reaction there was a phenomenon of collective amnesia concerning the abuse, and L\u00e9opold II was put on a pedestal. The outbreak of the First World War resuscitated the figure of Roger Casement in yet another perspective. The Great War was a time of propaganda where partial truths are turned into patriotic dogmas. With the growing feeling of Belgian national pride, the country framed itself sympathetically with the hanging of Roger Casement by the British authorities for treason. The papers once again insisted on Casement\u2019s report as a pack of lies intended to steal the Congo away from Belgium. Today still, former Belgian colonials look upon Casement\u2019s report as exaggerated and his campaign as mainly anti-Belgian. In the end, the anti-Congo campaign created a dualistic representation of the CFS, one that has been taken up in literature by Adam Hochschild and Mario Vargas Llosa, both of whom represent Casement as the martyr of the humanitarian cause. This image of Casement as a martyr cannot be applied to Roger Casement, who was, and will always remain, a privileged witness of L\u00e9opold\u2019s rule in the Congo.

This is when the movement against the Congo Free State started to emerge. As the State asserted more and more its vitality and progress, the campaign will keep on growing, relying on some specific and isolated cases to invoke humanity as a pretext to conceal the true objective of their envy.
