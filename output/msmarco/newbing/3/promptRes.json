As newcomers came to the American West to farm, established cattlemen began to fence off their larger tracts of land with barbed wire in order to protect them from the farmers' claims. The settlers viewed this as a closing of the open range, and began to cut fences to attempt to reclaim lands in the public domain. The ensuing, widespread series of conflicts was known as the Fence Cutting Wars. Under the Homestead Act of 1862, the United States government offered 160 acres (65 ha) of lands in the west to those willing to reside on and improve their land. Farmers who were seeking cheap, plentiful land on which to raise herds of cattle flocked west. Some of these men accumulated more cattle than others, and companies or syndicates began to invest in the big cattle operations. Those with larger holdings of cattle were known as \"cattle kings,\" \"cattlemen,\" or \"cattle barons.\" Barbed wire, which was patented in 1874, was revolutionary in allowing farmers to protect their claims, crops, and livestock, particularly as the land started to fill up and competition for rights to and use of the land intensified. Barbed wire was a farmer's product at first, but cattlemen eventually adopted it to fence off their larger tracts of land. Barbed wire became an important factor in changing the cattle industry, as the free, open range became parceled off by barbed wire. Because of this development, the West saw the rise of big-pasture companies. By the 1880s, newcomers' livestock were beginning to overcrowd the herds of the larger cattlemen. The cattle kings began to fence off their lands to protect access to the rangelands and water, which infuriated many homesteaders. There were many cases when large ranch owners not only fenced the property over which they claimed ownership, but also property considered public land. Some homesteaders retaliated by cutting the barbed wire of the fenced areas to give their livestock access to these lands, prompting the fence-cutting wars. Fence cutters were usually small-scale stockmen or farmers who used the free range and resented its appropriation, but also resented the fact that their stock could get tangled in the fences, injuring or killing the animals. The resulting Fence Cutting Wars were not confined to a particular area in the West, although some areas saw more intense clashes than others. According to historian Walter Prescott Webb, \"Fence-cutter wars broke out in Texas, Wyoming, New Mexico \u2013 wherever men began to fence.\" Struggles had erupted in Texas as early as 1881, but spread to Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana in the later 1880s. For example, in Wyoming in 1883, a court ordered a big cattle company to stop fencing public lands and to remove the fences it had built around certain sections. Yet, by 1885, barbed wire had basically overrun the eastern parts of the Wyoming Territory, which meant that legal efforts to stop the fencing of the West were a losing battle. In other parts of the country, however, the Fence Cutting Wars raged on until the late 1880s and early 1890s. In Texas, the Fence Cutting Wars were especially fierce. In 1883, a drought early in the year caused non-land owning cattlemen to become desperate, since fenced properties made it difficult to find the water and grass necessary to support their herds. The conflict was worse in Texas because the state entered the union in possession of its own lands, so people felt that their right to public access was assured \u2013 the land was for everyone to share. Fence cutting soon erupted as a result of the cattlemen with vast lands using barbed wire to fence their land, cutting off roads and access to public lands. The cuttings were well organized, with armed guards posted to protect the men while they worked. In 1883, fence cutting was reported in more than half the counties in Texas. To stop the fence-cutters, the state and local authorities tried many different methods. Counties offering rewards, shootouts between landowners and fence cutters, and legal trials were all different ways in which people tried to stop the fence cutters, but the conflict persisted. The fence cutters had substantial local support, and on occasion, found powerful outside allies. For instance, the New York and Texas Land Company was making profits by selling their land to homesteaders, and hence supported fence-cutting campaigns against the cattlemen. Local newspapers lined up either for or against the fence cutters. During 1883, groups of cowboys calling themselves names such as the Owls, Javelinas, or Blue Devils, were cutting fences. By the middle of that year, ranchers were employing armed bands to battle the anti-fence cowboys, and the Texas Rangers were dispatched to the area. By the fall of 1883, more\n\nquestion: Why did settlers use fences to contain their livestock?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "For protection from cattlemen and livestock claims, and to prevent overcrowding.", "usage": 1147}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In January 1884, Governor John Ireland called for a special assembly of the state legislature, which passed a bill mandating prison sentences for those caught fence cutting. Property owners were ordered to remove fences placed across property they did not own, provide gates every three miles, and keep the gates in good repair. By the mid 1880s, large-scale fence cutting in Texas had essentially ended. Another notable case occurred in San Miguel County, New Mexico. In the American Southwest, there were tensions between two ethnic groups, the mexicanos and Anglos, and particularly between the former and the large Anglo land companies and cattlemen taking control of public lands in the 1880s. The fence cutting movement that broke out was primarily led by smaller-scale Mexicano farmers. The conflict was sparked when Philip Millhiser purchased land from owners who possessed it under the earlier Las Vegas Land Grant. The plaintiff claimed he not only had ownership of the fields he had bought, but also to the common land of the grant. The defendants argued that it would take community assent to grant the common land to one particular owner. In the two years following 1887, during which the court case Millhiser v. Padilla was under consideration to determine the outcome of Millhiser's suit, Anglo owners continued to build new fences to enclose large portions of grant land in amounts that ranged from 1,000 to more than 10,000 acres (40 km2). In effect, the precedent of taking common lands had already been set even before the court made a ruling. These conflicts turned violent, with fence-cuttings, shootings, and the burning of a farm. In response, 21 fence cutters were indicted on 26 counts on May 3, 1889. The district attorney, the probate judge, and the assessor were opposed to the fence cutters and argued for the strongest measures possible to stop them. The presiding Judge Long was also a successful businessman who wanted to encourage economic growth in the region, and encouraged the jury to bring a stern verdict. However, vigilantes surrounded the courthouse and the jail to show their support for the indicted men, and the jury soon delivered a verdict of not guilty for one man, whereupon the charges for the other 20 were then dismissed. The Las Vegas Daily Optic, which was the leading newspaper in the county (and Republican-leaning), warned that the surge in fence cutting \"show with what jealousy the people watch the fencing of large tracts of lands, which they, with some color of reason, regard as public.\" The outbreak of fence cutting, which resulted when the legal system did not adequately address the fencing off of public lands, continued in other areas of the country as well. Farmers who filed land-use petitions grew increasingly desperate when local authorities did not respond quickly or effectively to their claims, and then resorted to more violent tactics. But in the end, these techniques were not effective in stopping the fencing of public lands, such as when organized violence died down and was replaced by political gridlock in New Mexico. The implications of the Fence Cutting Wars were numerous. They represented the last attempts toward keeping the open range alive. After the Fence Cutting Wars, Western settlement continued to grow denser and barbed wire crossed more and more of the formerly open range. Illegal fence building would become more common than fence cutting, as barbed wire continued to make its way across the region. As scholar Susanne Bentley puts it, barbed wire \"closed off land, closed people in, and enabled some people to acquire land illegally.\" The damages caused by fence-cutting was estimated to be $20 million by the fall of 1883. At least three people, as well as a Texas Ranger named Ben Warren, had died in the conflict. The spokesmen for the rich ranchers, who were abusing barb-wires to fence huge spaces to themselves, held a meeting with the fence-cutters. They settled the conflict by agreeing to remove fences from across public roads and land not owned or leased by the former, and to allow the fence-cutters passage through the gates, in return for an end to the wire-cutting. However, the effects it caused in Western economy was so problematic that it prompted Governor John Ireland to conduct a special session of the legislature to meet on January 8, 1884. The legislature made fence-cutting and pasture-burning felonies punishable by up to five years in prison. They also made fencing of public land a misdemeanor and required the removal of any such fences within six months. The conflicts of the Fence Cutting Wars, however, showed the resistance to this way of life, an unease that would be reflected in ensuing range wars throughout the late 19th century West.\n\nquestion: Why did settlers use fences to contain their livestock?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "To prevent fence cutting, illegal fence building, and to control their livestock.", "usage": 1090}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He rounded up some of the toughest, wildest longhorns in all of the state, or that\u2019s how he described them. Others say that the cattle were docile. And there are those who wonder whether this story is true at all. But never mind. John Warne Gates \u2014 a man who later won the nickname \u201cBet\u2010A\u2010Million Gates\u201d \u2014 began to take bets as to whether these powerful, ornery longhorns could break through the fragile-\u200b\u00adseeming wire. They couldn\u2019t. Even when Gates\u2019s sidekick, a Mexican cowboy, charged at the cattle, howling curses and waving burning brands, the wire held. Bet\u2010A\u2010Million Gates wasn\u2019t so worried about winning his wagers. He was selling a new kind of fence, and the orders soon came rolling in. An advertisement from 1875 touted this fence as \u201cThe Greatest Discovery of the Age,\u201d patented by J. F. Glidden of DeKalb, Illinois. John Warne Gates described it more poetically: \u201cLighter than air, stronger than whiskey, cheaper than dust.\u201d We simply call it barbed wire. Compared to the telephone, barbed wire wreaked huge changes on the American West and much more quickly. To call barbed wire the greatest discovery of the age might seem hyperbolic, even making allowances for the fact that Alexander Graham Bell was about to be awarded a patent for the telephone. But while we think of the telephone as transformative, barbed wire wreaked huge changes on the American West and much more quickly. Joseph Glidden\u2019s design for barbed wire wasn\u2019t the first, but it was the best. Glidden\u2019s design is the same as the barbed wire you can see today. The wicked barb is twisted around a strand of smooth wire; then a second strand of smooth wire is twisted together with the first to stop the barbs from sliding around. Farmers snapped it up. Why? In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Homestead Act. It specified that any citizen \u2014 including women and freed slaves \u2014 could lay claim to up to 160 acres of land in America\u2019s western territories. All they had to do was build a home there and work the land for five years. The idea was that the Homestead Act would improve the land and improve the citizenry, creating free and virtuous hardworking landowners with a strong stake in the future of the nation. It sounds simple. But the prairie was a vast, uncharted expanse. It had long been the territory of Native Americans. After Europeans arrived and pushed west, cowboys roamed free, herding cattle over the boundless plains. So settlers needed fences, not least to keep those free-\u200b\u00adroaming cattle from trampling their crops. There wasn\u2019t much wood and certainly not enough to fence what was often called the \u201cGreat American Desert.\u201d Farmers tried growing thornbush hedges, but these were slow-\u200b\u00adgrowing and inflexible. Smooth-wire fences didn\u2019t work either \u2014 the cattle pushed through them. Barbed wire solved one of the biggest problems settlers faced, but it also sparked the ferocious \u201cfence-cutting wars.\u201d The US Department of Agriculture conducted a study in 1870 and concluded that until farmers could find fencing that worked, it would be impossible to settle the American West. The West, in turn, seethed with potential solutions: at the time, it was the source of more proposals for new fencing technologies than the rest of the world put together. The idea that emerged from this intellectual ferment was barbed wire. It changed what the Homestead Act could not. Until it was developed, private ownership of prairie land wasn\u2019t common because it wasn\u2019t feasible. While barbed wire spread because it solved one of the biggest problems settlers faced, it also sparked ferocious disagreements. The homesteading farmers were often trying to stake out property on the territory of Native American tribes. And 25 years after the Homestead Act came the Dawes Act, which forcibly assigned land to Native American families and gave the rest to white farmers. Philosopher Olivier Razac comments that the Dawes Act \u201chelped destroy the foundations of Indian society.\u201d No wonder these tribes called barbed wire \u201cthe devil\u2019s rope.\u201d Old-\u200b\u00adtime cowboys also lived by the principle that cattle could graze freely across the plains \u2014 the law of the open range \u2014 and they hated the wire. Cattle got nasty wounds and infections from running into it. When blizzards came, the cows would try to head south; sometimes they got stuck against the wire and died in the thousands.\n\nquestion: Why did settlers use fences to contain their livestock?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Settlers used fences to keep free-\u200b\u00adroaming cattle from trampling their crops.", "usage": 1100}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

When barbed-\u200b\u00adwire fences went up across the West, fights broke out. In the \u201cfence-\u200b\u00adcutting wars,\u201d masked gangs with names like the Blue Devils and the Javelinas cut the wires and left death threats warning fence owners not to rebuild. There were shoot-\u200b\u00adouts, even a few deaths. Eventually, authorities clamped down. The fence-\u200b\u00adcutting wars ended, and the barbed wire remained. \u201cIt makes me sick,\u201d said one trail driver in 1883, \u201cwhen I think of onions and Irish potatoes growing where mustang ponies should be exercising and where four-\u200b\u00adyear-\u200b\u00adold steers should be getting ripe for market.\u201d And if the cowboys were outraged, the Native Americans suffered far worse. Before barbed wire, Western settlers had legal rights over their land but no way of exerting practical control. These ferocious arguments reflected an old philosophical debate. The 17th-\u200b\u00adcentury English philosopher John Locke \u2014 a great influence on America\u2019s Founding Fathers \u2014 puzzled over the problem of how anybody might legally own land. Once upon a time, nobody owned anything; land was a gift of nature or of God. But Locke\u2019s world was full of privately owned land, whether the owner was the King or a simple yeoman. How had it become privately owned? Was it the result of a guy with a bunch of goons grabbing what he could? If so, all civilization was built on violent theft. That wasn\u2019t a welcome conclusion to Locke or his wealthy patrons. He argued that we all own our own labor. So if you mix your labor with the land that nature provides \u2014 for instance, by plowing the soil \u2014 then you\u2019ve blended something you own with something that nobody owns. By working the land, he said, you\u2019ve come to own it. This wasn\u2019t a purely theoretical argument. Locke was actively engaged in the debate over Europe\u2019s colonization of America. Political scientist Barbara Arneil, an expert on Locke, writes, \u201cThe question, \u2018How was private property created by the first men?\u2019 is for \u2026 Locke the same question as, \u2018Who has just title to appropriate the lands of America now?\u2019\u201d Locke also made the claim that the land in the new world was unclaimed \u2014 that is, because the indigenous tribes hadn\u2019t \u201cimproved\u201d the land, they had no right to it. Not every European philosopher agreed. Jean-\u200b\u00adJacques Rousseau, an 18th-\u200b\u00adcentury French philosopher, protested the evils of enclosure. In his \u201cDiscourse on Inequality\u201d he lamented, \u201cthe first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying \u2018This is mine\u2019 and found people simple enough to believe him.\u201d This man, said Rousseau, \u201cwas the real founder of civil society.\u201d Rousseau did not intend that as a compliment. But it\u2019s true that modern economies are built on private property \u2014 on the legal fact that most things have an owner, usually a person or a corporation. Modern economies are also built on the idea that private property is good, because it gives people an incentive to invest in what they own, whether that\u2019s a patch of land in the American Midwest, an apartment in India, or even a piece of intellectual property such as the rights to Mickey Mouse. It\u2019s a powerful argument, and it was ruthlessly deployed by those who wanted to claim that Native Americans didn\u2019t have a right to their territory because they weren\u2019t actively developing it. Nobody has invented virtual barbed wire that can fence off songs as well as physical barbed wire fenced off land, but it hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying. However, legal facts are abstract. To get the benefits of owning something, you have to be able to assert control over it. Until barbed wire was developed, Western settlers had legal rights over their land but no way of exerting practical control. Barbed wire is still used to fence off land across the world. And in other spheres of the economy, the battle to own in practice what you own in theory continues to rage. One example is digital rights management, or DRM. DRM systems are attempts to erect a virtual barbed wire around digital property, like a movie or a song, to prevent people from copying it illegally. Even though musicians may have copyright on their music, copyright is a weak defense against file-\u200bsharing software. Nobody has invented virtual barbed wire that can fence off songs as effectively as physical barbed wire fenced off land, but it hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying.

The settlers viewed this as a closing of the open range, and began to cut fences to attempt to reclaim lands in the public domain. The ensuing, widespread series of conflicts was known as the Fence Cutting Wars. Under the Homestead Act of 1862, the United States government offered 160 acres (65 ha) of lands in the west to those willing to reside on and improve their land. Farmers who were seeking cheap, plentiful land on which to raise herds of cattle flocked west. Some of these men accumulated more cattle than others, and companies or syndicates began to invest in the big cattle operations. Those with larger holdings of cattle were known as \"cattle kings,\" \"cattlemen,\" or \"cattle barons.\" Barbed wire, which was patented in 1874, was revolutionary in allowing farmers to protect their claims, crops, and livestock, particularly as the land started to fill up and competition for rights to and use of the land intensified. Barbed wire was a farmer's product at first, but cattlemen eventually adopted it to fence off their larger tracts of land. Barbed wire became an important factor in changing the cattle industry, as the free, open range became parceled off by barbed wire. Because of this development, the West saw the rise of big-pasture companies. By the 1880s, newcomers' livestock were beginning to overcrowd the herds of the larger cattlemen. The cattle kings began to fence off their lands to protect access to the rangelands and water, which infuriated many homesteaders. There were many cases when large ranch owners not only fenced the property over which they claimed ownership, but also property considered public land. Some homesteaders retaliated by cutting the barbed wire of the fenced areas to give their livestock access to these lands, prompting the fence-cutting wars. Fence cutters were usually small-scale stockmen or farmers who used the free range and resented its appropriation, but also resented the fact that their stock could get tangled in the fences, injuring or killing the animals. The resulting Fence Cutting Wars were not confined to a particular area in the West, although some areas saw more intense clashes than others. According to historian Walter Prescott Webb, \"Fence-cutter wars broke out in Texas, Wyoming, New Mexico \u2013 wherever men began to fence.\" Struggles had erupted in Texas as early as 1881, but spread to Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana in the later 1880s. For example, in Wyoming in 1883, a court ordered a big cattle company to stop fencing public lands and to remove the fences it had built around certain sections. Yet, by 1885, barbed wire had basically overrun the eastern parts of the Wyoming Territory, which meant that legal efforts to stop the fencing of the West were a losing battle. In other parts of the country, however, the Fence Cutting Wars raged on until the late 1880s and early 1890s. In Texas, the Fence Cutting Wars were especially fierce. In 1883, a drought early in the year caused non-land owning cattlemen to become desperate, since fenced properties made it difficult to find the water and grass necessary to support their herds. The conflict was worse in Texas because the state entered the union in possession of its own lands, so people felt that their right to public access was assured \u2013 the land was for everyone to share. Fence cutting soon erupted as a result of the cattlemen with vast lands using barbed wire to fence their land, cutting off roads and access to public lands. The cuttings were well organized, with armed guards posted to protect the men while they worked. In 1883, fence cutting was reported in more than half the counties in Texas. To stop the fence-cutters, the state and local authorities tried many different methods. Counties offering rewards, shootouts between landowners and fence cutters, and legal trials were all different ways in which people tried to stop the fence cutters, but the conflict persisted. The fence cutters had substantial local support, and on occasion, found powerful outside allies. For instance, the New York and Texas Land Company was making profits by selling their land to homesteaders, and hence supported fence-cutting campaigns against the cattlemen. Local newspapers lined up either for or against the fence cutters. During 1883, groups of cowboys calling themselves names such as the Owls, Javelinas, or Blue Devils, were cutting fences. By the middle of that year, ranchers were employing armed bands to battle the anti-fence cowboys, and the Texas Rangers were dispatched to the area.

In January 1884, Governor John Ireland called for a special assembly of the state legislature, which passed a bill mandating prison sentences for those caught fence cutting. Property owners were ordered to remove fences placed across property they did not own, provide gates every three miles, and keep the gates in good repair. By the mid 1880s, large-scale fence cutting in Texas had essentially ended. Another notable case occurred in San Miguel County, New Mexico. In the American Southwest, there were tensions between two ethnic groups, the mexicanos and Anglos, and particularly between the former and the large Anglo land companies and cattlemen taking control of public lands in the 1880s. The fence cutting movement that broke out was primarily led by smaller-scale Mexicano farmers. The conflict was sparked when Philip Millhiser purchased land from owners who possessed it under the earlier Las Vegas Land Grant. The plaintiff claimed he not only had ownership of the fields he had bought, but also to the common land of the grant. The defendants argued that it would take community assent to grant the common land to one particular owner. In the two years following 1887, during which the court case Millhiser v. Padilla was under consideration to determine the outcome of Millhiser's suit, Anglo owners continued to build new fences to enclose large portions of grant land in amounts that ranged from 1,000 to more than 10,000 acres (40 km2). In effect, the precedent of taking common lands had already been set even before the court made a ruling. These conflicts turned violent, with fence-cuttings, shootings, and the burning of a farm. In response, 21 fence cutters were indicted on 26 counts on May 3, 1889. The district attorney, the probate judge, and the assessor were opposed to the fence cutters and argued for the strongest measures possible to stop them. The presiding Judge Long was also a successful businessman who wanted to encourage economic growth in the region, and encouraged the jury to bring a stern verdict. However, vigilantes surrounded the courthouse and the jail to show their support for the indicted men, and the jury soon delivered a verdict of not guilty for one man, whereupon the charges for the other 20 were then dismissed. The Las Vegas Daily Optic, which was the leading newspaper in the county (and Republican-leaning), warned that the surge in fence cutting \"show with what jealousy the people watch the fencing of large tracts of lands, which they, with some color of reason, regard as public.\" The outbreak of fence cutting, which resulted when the legal system did not adequately address the fencing off of public lands, continued in other areas of the country as well. Farmers who filed land-use petitions grew increasingly desperate when local authorities did not respond quickly or effectively to their claims, and then resorted to more violent tactics. But in the end, these techniques were not effective in stopping the fencing of public lands, such as when organized violence died down and was replaced by political gridlock in New Mexico. The implications of the Fence Cutting Wars were numerous. They represented the last attempts toward keeping the open range alive. After the Fence Cutting Wars, Western settlement continued to grow denser and barbed wire crossed more and more of the formerly open range. Illegal fence building would become more common than fence cutting, as barbed wire continued to make its way across the region. As scholar Susanne Bentley puts it, barbed wire \"closed off land, closed people in, and enabled some people to acquire land illegally.\" The damages caused by fence-cutting was estimated to be $20 million by the fall of 1883. At least three people, as well as a Texas Ranger named Ben Warren, had died in the conflict. The spokesmen for the rich ranchers, who were abusing barb-wires to fence huge spaces to themselves, held a meeting with the fence-cutters. They settled the conflict by agreeing to remove fences from across public roads and land not owned or leased by the former, and to allow the fence-cutters passage through the gates, in return for an end to the wire-cutting. However, the effects it caused in Western economy was so problematic that it prompted Governor John Ireland to conduct a special session of the legislature to meet on January 8, 1884. The legislature made fence-cutting and pasture-burning felonies punishable by up to five years in prison. They also made fencing of public land a misdemeanor and required the removal of any such fences within six months. The conflicts of the Fence Cutting Wars, however, showed the resistance to this way of life, an unease that would be reflected in ensuing range wars throughout the late 19th century West.\n\nquestion: Why were fences used to protect crops?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1075}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He rounded up some of the toughest, wildest longhorns in all of the state, or that\u2019s how he described them. Others say that the cattle were docile. And there are those who wonder whether this story is true at all. But never mind. John Warne Gates \u2014 a man who later won the nickname \u201cBet\u2010A\u2010Million Gates\u201d \u2014 began to take bets as to whether these powerful, ornery longhorns could break through the fragile-\u200b\u00adseeming wire. They couldn\u2019t. Even when Gates\u2019s sidekick, a Mexican cowboy, charged at the cattle, howling curses and waving burning brands, the wire held. Bet\u2010A\u2010Million Gates wasn\u2019t so worried about winning his wagers. He was selling a new kind of fence, and the orders soon came rolling in. An advertisement from 1875 touted this fence as \u201cThe Greatest Discovery of the Age,\u201d patented by J. F. Glidden of DeKalb, Illinois. John Warne Gates described it more poetically: \u201cLighter than air, stronger than whiskey, cheaper than dust.\u201d We simply call it barbed wire. Compared to the telephone, barbed wire wreaked huge changes on the American West and much more quickly. To call barbed wire the greatest discovery of the age might seem hyperbolic, even making allowances for the fact that Alexander Graham Bell was about to be awarded a patent for the telephone. But while we think of the telephone as transformative, barbed wire wreaked huge changes on the American West and much more quickly. Joseph Glidden\u2019s design for barbed wire wasn\u2019t the first, but it was the best. Glidden\u2019s design is the same as the barbed wire you can see today. The wicked barb is twisted around a strand of smooth wire; then a second strand of smooth wire is twisted together with the first to stop the barbs from sliding around. Farmers snapped it up. Why? In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Homestead Act. It specified that any citizen \u2014 including women and freed slaves \u2014 could lay claim to up to 160 acres of land in America\u2019s western territories. All they had to do was build a home there and work the land for five years. The idea was that the Homestead Act would improve the land and improve the citizenry, creating free and virtuous hardworking landowners with a strong stake in the future of the nation. It sounds simple. But the prairie was a vast, uncharted expanse. It had long been the territory of Native Americans. After Europeans arrived and pushed west, cowboys roamed free, herding cattle over the boundless plains. So settlers needed fences, not least to keep those free-\u200b\u00adroaming cattle from trampling their crops. There wasn\u2019t much wood and certainly not enough to fence what was often called the \u201cGreat American Desert.\u201d Farmers tried growing thornbush hedges, but these were slow-\u200b\u00adgrowing and inflexible. Smooth-wire fences didn\u2019t work either \u2014 the cattle pushed through them. Barbed wire solved one of the biggest problems settlers faced, but it also sparked the ferocious \u201cfence-cutting wars.\u201d The US Department of Agriculture conducted a study in 1870 and concluded that until farmers could find fencing that worked, it would be impossible to settle the American West. The West, in turn, seethed with potential solutions: at the time, it was the source of more proposals for new fencing technologies than the rest of the world put together. The idea that emerged from this intellectual ferment was barbed wire. It changed what the Homestead Act could not. Until it was developed, private ownership of prairie land wasn\u2019t common because it wasn\u2019t feasible. While barbed wire spread because it solved one of the biggest problems settlers faced, it also sparked ferocious disagreements. The homesteading farmers were often trying to stake out property on the territory of Native American tribes. And 25 years after the Homestead Act came the Dawes Act, which forcibly assigned land to Native American families and gave the rest to white farmers. Philosopher Olivier Razac comments that the Dawes Act \u201chelped destroy the foundations of Indian society.\u201d No wonder these tribes called barbed wire \u201cthe devil\u2019s rope.\u201d Old-\u200b\u00adtime cowboys also lived by the principle that cattle could graze freely across the plains \u2014 the law of the open range \u2014 and they hated the wire. Cattle got nasty wounds and infections from running into it. When blizzards came, the cows would try to head south; sometimes they got stuck against the wire and died in the thousands.\n\nquestion: Why were fences used to protect crops?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "To keep free-roaming cattle from trampling crops.", "usage": 1089}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

When barbed-\u200b\u00adwire fences went up across the West, fights broke out. In the \u201cfence-\u200b\u00adcutting wars,\u201d masked gangs with names like the Blue Devils and the Javelinas cut the wires and left death threats warning fence owners not to rebuild. There were shoot-\u200b\u00adouts, even a few deaths. Eventually, authorities clamped down. The fence-\u200b\u00adcutting wars ended, and the barbed wire remained. \u201cIt makes me sick,\u201d said one trail driver in 1883, \u201cwhen I think of onions and Irish potatoes growing where mustang ponies should be exercising and where four-\u200b\u00adyear-\u200b\u00adold steers should be getting ripe for market.\u201d And if the cowboys were outraged, the Native Americans suffered far worse. Before barbed wire, Western settlers had legal rights over their land but no way of exerting practical control. These ferocious arguments reflected an old philosophical debate. The 17th-\u200b\u00adcentury English philosopher John Locke \u2014 a great influence on America\u2019s Founding Fathers \u2014 puzzled over the problem of how anybody might legally own land. Once upon a time, nobody owned anything; land was a gift of nature or of God. But Locke\u2019s world was full of privately owned land, whether the owner was the King or a simple yeoman. How had it become privately owned? Was it the result of a guy with a bunch of goons grabbing what he could? If so, all civilization was built on violent theft. That wasn\u2019t a welcome conclusion to Locke or his wealthy patrons. He argued that we all own our own labor. So if you mix your labor with the land that nature provides \u2014 for instance, by plowing the soil \u2014 then you\u2019ve blended something you own with something that nobody owns. By working the land, he said, you\u2019ve come to own it. This wasn\u2019t a purely theoretical argument. Locke was actively engaged in the debate over Europe\u2019s colonization of America. Political scientist Barbara Arneil, an expert on Locke, writes, \u201cThe question, \u2018How was private property created by the first men?\u2019 is for \u2026 Locke the same question as, \u2018Who has just title to appropriate the lands of America now?\u2019\u201d Locke also made the claim that the land in the new world was unclaimed \u2014 that is, because the indigenous tribes hadn\u2019t \u201cimproved\u201d the land, they had no right to it. Not every European philosopher agreed. Jean-\u200b\u00adJacques Rousseau, an 18th-\u200b\u00adcentury French philosopher, protested the evils of enclosure. In his \u201cDiscourse on Inequality\u201d he lamented, \u201cthe first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying \u2018This is mine\u2019 and found people simple enough to believe him.\u201d This man, said Rousseau, \u201cwas the real founder of civil society.\u201d Rousseau did not intend that as a compliment. But it\u2019s true that modern economies are built on private property \u2014 on the legal fact that most things have an owner, usually a person or a corporation. Modern economies are also built on the idea that private property is good, because it gives people an incentive to invest in what they own, whether that\u2019s a patch of land in the American Midwest, an apartment in India, or even a piece of intellectual property such as the rights to Mickey Mouse. It\u2019s a powerful argument, and it was ruthlessly deployed by those who wanted to claim that Native Americans didn\u2019t have a right to their territory because they weren\u2019t actively developing it. Nobody has invented virtual barbed wire that can fence off songs as well as physical barbed wire fenced off land, but it hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying. However, legal facts are abstract. To get the benefits of owning something, you have to be able to assert control over it. Until barbed wire was developed, Western settlers had legal rights over their land but no way of exerting practical control. Barbed wire is still used to fence off land across the world. And in other spheres of the economy, the battle to own in practice what you own in theory continues to rage. One example is digital rights management, or DRM. DRM systems are attempts to erect a virtual barbed wire around digital property, like a movie or a song, to prevent people from copying it illegally. Even though musicians may have copyright on their music, copyright is a weak defense against file-\u200bsharing software. Nobody has invented virtual barbed wire that can fence off songs as effectively as physical barbed wire fenced off land, but it hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying.

Six years later, in 1880, the factory in DeKalb turned out 263,000 miles of wire, enough to circle the world ten times over.

He rounded up some of the toughest, wildest longhorns in all of the state, or that\u2019s how he described them. Others say that the cattle were docile. And there are those who wonder whether this story is true at all. But never mind. John Warne Gates \u2014 a man who later won the nickname \u201cBet\u2010A\u2010Million Gates\u201d \u2014 began to take bets as to whether these powerful, ornery longhorns could break through the fragile-\u200b\u00adseeming wire. They couldn\u2019t. Even when Gates\u2019s sidekick, a Mexican cowboy, charged at the cattle, howling curses and waving burning brands, the wire held. Bet\u2010A\u2010Million Gates wasn\u2019t so worried about winning his wagers. He was selling a new kind of fence, and the orders soon came rolling in. An advertisement from 1875 touted this fence as \u201cThe Greatest Discovery of the Age,\u201d patented by J. F. Glidden of DeKalb, Illinois. John Warne Gates described it more poetically: \u201cLighter than air, stronger than whiskey, cheaper than dust.\u201d We simply call it barbed wire. Compared to the telephone, barbed wire wreaked huge changes on the American West and much more quickly. To call barbed wire the greatest discovery of the age might seem hyperbolic, even making allowances for the fact that Alexander Graham Bell was about to be awarded a patent for the telephone. But while we think of the telephone as transformative, barbed wire wreaked huge changes on the American West and much more quickly. Joseph Glidden\u2019s design for barbed wire wasn\u2019t the first, but it was the best. Glidden\u2019s design is the same as the barbed wire you can see today. The wicked barb is twisted around a strand of smooth wire; then a second strand of smooth wire is twisted together with the first to stop the barbs from sliding around. Farmers snapped it up. Why? In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Homestead Act. It specified that any citizen \u2014 including women and freed slaves \u2014 could lay claim to up to 160 acres of land in America\u2019s western territories. All they had to do was build a home there and work the land for five years. The idea was that the Homestead Act would improve the land and improve the citizenry, creating free and virtuous hardworking landowners with a strong stake in the future of the nation. It sounds simple. But the prairie was a vast, uncharted expanse. It had long been the territory of Native Americans. After Europeans arrived and pushed west, cowboys roamed free, herding cattle over the boundless plains. So settlers needed fences, not least to keep those free-\u200b\u00adroaming cattle from trampling their crops. There wasn\u2019t much wood and certainly not enough to fence what was often called the \u201cGreat American Desert.\u201d Farmers tried growing thornbush hedges, but these were slow-\u200b\u00adgrowing and inflexible. Smooth-wire fences didn\u2019t work either \u2014 the cattle pushed through them. Barbed wire solved one of the biggest problems settlers faced, but it also sparked the ferocious \u201cfence-cutting wars.\u201d The US Department of Agriculture conducted a study in 1870 and concluded that until farmers could find fencing that worked, it would be impossible to settle the American West. The West, in turn, seethed with potential solutions: at the time, it was the source of more proposals for new fencing technologies than the rest of the world put together. The idea that emerged from this intellectual ferment was barbed wire. It changed what the Homestead Act could not. Until it was developed, private ownership of prairie land wasn\u2019t common because it wasn\u2019t feasible. While barbed wire spread because it solved one of the biggest problems settlers faced, it also sparked ferocious disagreements. The homesteading farmers were often trying to stake out property on the territory of Native American tribes.

Before barbed wire, Western settlers had legal rights over their land but no way of exerting practical control. These ferocious arguments reflected an old philosophical debate. The 17th-\u200b\u00adcentury English philosopher John Locke \u2014 a great influence on America\u2019s Founding Fathers \u2014 puzzled over the problem of how anybody might legally own land. Once upon a time, nobody owned anything; land was a gift of nature or of God. But Locke\u2019s world was full of privately owned land, whether the owner was the King or a simple yeoman. How had it become privately owned? Was it the result of a guy with a bunch of goons grabbing what he could? If so, all civilization was built on violent theft. That wasn\u2019t a welcome conclusion to Locke or his wealthy patrons. He argued that we all own our own labor. So if you mix your labor with the land that nature provides \u2014 for instance, by plowing the soil \u2014 then you\u2019ve blended something you own with something that nobody owns. By working the land, he said, you\u2019ve come to own it. This wasn\u2019t a purely theoretical argument. Locke was actively engaged in the debate over Europe\u2019s colonization of America. Political scientist Barbara Arneil, an expert on Locke, writes, \u201cThe question, \u2018How was private property created by the first men?\u2019 is for \u2026 Locke the same question as, \u2018Who has just title to appropriate the lands of America now?\u2019\u201d Locke also made the claim that the land in the new world was unclaimed \u2014 that is, because the indigenous tribes hadn\u2019t \u201cimproved\u201d the land, they had no right to it. Not every European philosopher agreed. Jean-\u200b\u00adJacques Rousseau, an 18th-\u200b\u00adcentury French philosopher, protested the evils of enclosure. In his \u201cDiscourse on Inequality\u201d he lamented, \u201cthe first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying \u2018This is mine\u2019 and found people simple enough to believe him.\u201d This man, said Rousseau, \u201cwas the real founder of civil society.\u201d Rousseau did not intend that as a compliment. But it\u2019s true that modern economies are built on private property \u2014 on the legal fact that most things have an owner, usually a person or a corporation. Modern economies are also built on the idea that private property is good, because it gives people an incentive to invest in what they own, whether that\u2019s a patch of land in the American Midwest, an apartment in India, or even a piece of intellectual property such as the rights to Mickey Mouse. It\u2019s a powerful argument, and it was ruthlessly deployed by those who wanted to claim that Native Americans didn\u2019t have a right to their territory because they weren\u2019t actively developing it. Nobody has invented virtual barbed wire that can fence off songs as well as physical barbed wire fenced off land, but it hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying. However, legal facts are abstract. To get the benefits of owning something, you have to be able to assert control over it. Until barbed wire was developed, Western settlers had legal rights over their land but no way of exerting practical control. Barbed wire is still used to fence off land across the world. And in other spheres of the economy, the battle to own in practice what you own in theory continues to rage. One example is digital rights management, or DRM. DRM systems are attempts to erect a virtual barbed wire around digital property, like a movie or a song, to prevent people from copying it illegally. Even though musicians may have copyright on their music, copyright is a weak defense against file-\u200bsharing software. Nobody has invented virtual barbed wire that can fence off songs as effectively as physical barbed wire fenced off land, but it hasn\u2019t stopped people from trying.

As newcomers came to the American West to farm, established cattlemen began to fence off their larger tracts of land with barbed wire in order to protect them from the farmers' claims. The settlers viewed this as a closing of the open range, and began to cut fences to attempt to reclaim lands in the public domain. The ensuing, widespread series of conflicts was known as the Fence Cutting Wars. Under the Homestead Act of 1862, the United States government offered 160 acres (65 ha) of lands in the west to those willing to reside on and improve their land. Farmers who were seeking cheap, plentiful land on which to raise herds of cattle flocked west. Some of these men accumulated more cattle than others, and companies or syndicates began to invest in the big cattle operations. Those with larger holdings of cattle were known as \"cattle kings,\" \"cattlemen,\" or \"cattle barons.\" Barbed wire, which was patented in 1874, was revolutionary in allowing farmers to protect their claims, crops, and livestock, particularly as the land started to fill up and competition for rights to and use of the land intensified. Barbed wire was a farmer's product at first, but cattlemen eventually adopted it to fence off their larger tracts of land. Barbed wire became an important factor in changing the cattle industry, as the free, open range became parceled off by barbed wire. Because of this development, the West saw the rise of big-pasture companies. By the 1880s, newcomers' livestock were beginning to overcrowd the herds of the larger cattlemen. The cattle kings began to fence off their lands to protect access to the rangelands and water, which infuriated many homesteaders. There were many cases when large ranch owners not only fenced the property over which they claimed ownership, but also property considered public land. Some homesteaders retaliated by cutting the barbed wire of the fenced areas to give their livestock access to these lands, prompting the fence-cutting wars. Fence cutters were usually small-scale stockmen or farmers who used the free range and resented its appropriation, but also resented the fact that their stock could get tangled in the fences, injuring or killing the animals. The resulting Fence Cutting Wars were not confined to a particular area in the West, although some areas saw more intense clashes than others. According to historian Walter Prescott Webb, \"Fence-cutter wars broke out in Texas, Wyoming, New Mexico \u2013 wherever men began to fence.\" Struggles had erupted in Texas as early as 1881, but spread to Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana in the later 1880s. For example, in Wyoming in 1883, a court ordered a big cattle company to stop fencing public lands and to remove the fences it had built around certain sections. Yet, by 1885, barbed wire had basically overrun the eastern parts of the Wyoming Territory, which meant that legal efforts to stop the fencing of the West were a losing battle. In other parts of the country, however, the Fence Cutting Wars raged on until the late 1880s and early 1890s. In Texas, the Fence Cutting Wars were especially fierce. In 1883, a drought early in the year caused non-land owning cattlemen to become desperate, since fenced properties made it difficult to find the water and grass necessary to support their herds. The conflict was worse in Texas because the state entered the union in possession of its own lands, so people felt that their right to public access was assured \u2013 the land was for everyone to share. Fence cutting soon erupted as a result of the cattlemen with vast lands using barbed wire to fence their land, cutting off roads and access to public lands. The cuttings were well organized, with armed guards posted to protect the men while they worked. In 1883, fence cutting was reported in more than half the counties in Texas. To stop the fence-cutters, the state and local authorities tried many different methods. Counties offering rewards, shootouts between landowners and fence cutters, and legal trials were all different ways in which people tried to stop the fence cutters, but the conflict persisted. The fence cutters had substantial local support, and on occasion, found powerful outside allies. For instance, the New York and Texas Land Company was making profits by selling their land to homesteaders, and hence supported fence-cutting campaigns against the cattlemen. Local newspapers lined up either for or against the fence cutters. During 1883, groups of cowboys calling themselves names such as the Owls, Javelinas, or Blue Devils, were cutting fences. By the middle of that year, ranchers were employing armed bands to battle the anti-fence cowboys, and the Texas Rangers were dispatched to the area. By the fall of 1883, more\n\nquestion: Why was preventing overgrazing important for settlers?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "To protect rights to rangelands and water.", "usage": 1141}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In January 1884, Governor John Ireland called for a special assembly of the state legislature, which passed a bill mandating prison sentences for those caught fence cutting. Property owners were ordered to remove fences placed across property they did not own, provide gates every three miles, and keep the gates in good repair. By the mid 1880s, large-scale fence cutting in Texas had essentially ended. Another notable case occurred in San Miguel County, New Mexico. In the American Southwest, there were tensions between two ethnic groups, the mexicanos and Anglos, and particularly between the former and the large Anglo land companies and cattlemen taking control of public lands in the 1880s. The fence cutting movement that broke out was primarily led by smaller-scale Mexicano farmers. The conflict was sparked when Philip Millhiser purchased land from owners who possessed it under the earlier Las Vegas Land Grant. The plaintiff claimed he not only had ownership of the fields he had bought, but also to the common land of the grant. The defendants argued that it would take community assent to grant the common land to one particular owner. In the two years following 1887, during which the court case Millhiser v. Padilla was under consideration to determine the outcome of Millhiser's suit, Anglo owners continued to build new fences to enclose large portions of grant land in amounts that ranged from 1,000 to more than 10,000 acres (40 km2). In effect, the precedent of taking common lands had already been set even before the court made a ruling. These conflicts turned violent, with fence-cuttings, shootings, and the burning of a farm. In response, 21 fence cutters were indicted on 26 counts on May 3, 1889. The district attorney, the probate judge, and the assessor were opposed to the fence cutters and argued for the strongest measures possible to stop them. The presiding Judge Long was also a successful businessman who wanted to encourage economic growth in the region, and encouraged the jury to bring a stern verdict. However, vigilantes surrounded the courthouse and the jail to show their support for the indicted men, and the jury soon delivered a verdict of not guilty for one man, whereupon the charges for the other 20 were then dismissed. The Las Vegas Daily Optic, which was the leading newspaper in the county (and Republican-leaning), warned that the surge in fence cutting \"show with what jealousy the people watch the fencing of large tracts of lands, which they, with some color of reason, regard as public.\" The outbreak of fence cutting, which resulted when the legal system did not adequately address the fencing off of public lands, continued in other areas of the country as well. Farmers who filed land-use petitions grew increasingly desperate when local authorities did not respond quickly or effectively to their claims, and then resorted to more violent tactics. But in the end, these techniques were not effective in stopping the fencing of public lands, such as when organized violence died down and was replaced by political gridlock in New Mexico. The implications of the Fence Cutting Wars were numerous. They represented the last attempts toward keeping the open range alive. After the Fence Cutting Wars, Western settlement continued to grow denser and barbed wire crossed more and more of the formerly open range. Illegal fence building would become more common than fence cutting, as barbed wire continued to make its way across the region. As scholar Susanne Bentley puts it, barbed wire \"closed off land, closed people in, and enabled some people to acquire land illegally.\" The damages caused by fence-cutting was estimated to be $20 million by the fall of 1883. At least three people, as well as a Texas Ranger named Ben Warren, had died in the conflict. The spokesmen for the rich ranchers, who were abusing barb-wires to fence huge spaces to themselves, held a meeting with the fence-cutters. They settled the conflict by agreeing to remove fences from across public roads and land not owned or leased by the former, and to allow the fence-cutters passage through the gates, in return for an end to the wire-cutting. However, the effects it caused in Western economy was so problematic that it prompted Governor John Ireland to conduct a special session of the legislature to meet on January 8, 1884. The legislature made fence-cutting and pasture-burning felonies punishable by up to five years in prison. They also made fencing of public land a misdemeanor and required the removal of any such fences within six months. The conflicts of the Fence Cutting Wars, however, showed the resistance to this way of life, an unease that would be reflected in ensuing range wars throughout the late 19th century West.\n\nquestion: Why was preventing overgrazing important for settlers?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "It helped keep the open range alive.", "usage": 1083}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

By working the land, he said, you\u2019ve come to own it. This wasn\u2019t a purely theoretical argument. Locke was actively engaged in the debate over Europe\u2019s colonization of America. Political scientist Barbara Arneil, an expert on Locke, writes, \u201cThe question, \u2018How was private property created by the first men?\u2019 is for \u2026 Locke the same question as, \u2018Who has just title to appropriate the lands of America now?\u2019\u201d Locke also made the claim that the land in the new world was unclaimed \u2014 that is, because the indigenous tribes hadn\u2019t \u201cimproved\u201d the land, they had no right to it.

As newcomers came to the American West to farm, established cattlemen began to fence off their larger tracts of land with barbed wire in order to protect them from the farmers' claims. The settlers viewed this as a closing of the open range, and began to cut fences to attempt to reclaim lands in the public domain. The ensuing, widespread series of conflicts was known as the Fence Cutting Wars. Under the Homestead Act of 1862, the United States government offered 160 acres (65 ha) of lands in the west to those willing to reside on and improve their land. Farmers who were seeking cheap, plentiful land on which to raise herds of cattle flocked west. Some of these men accumulated more cattle than others, and companies or syndicates began to invest in the big cattle operations. Those with larger holdings of cattle were known as \"cattle kings,\" \"cattlemen,\" or \"cattle barons.\" Barbed wire, which was patented in 1874, was revolutionary in allowing farmers to protect their claims, crops, and livestock, particularly as the land started to fill up and competition for rights to and use of the land intensified. Barbed wire was a farmer's product at first, but cattlemen eventually adopted it to fence off their larger tracts of land. Barbed wire became an important factor in changing the cattle industry, as the free, open range became parceled off by barbed wire. Because of this development, the West saw the rise of big-pasture companies. By the 1880s, newcomers' livestock were beginning to overcrowd the herds of the larger cattlemen. The cattle kings began to fence off their lands to protect access to the rangelands and water, which infuriated many homesteaders. There were many cases when large ranch owners not only fenced the property over which they claimed ownership, but also property considered public land. Some homesteaders retaliated by cutting the barbed wire of the fenced areas to give their livestock access to these lands, prompting the fence-cutting wars. Fence cutters were usually small-scale stockmen or farmers who used the free range and resented its appropriation, but also resented the fact that their stock could get tangled in the fences, injuring or killing the animals. The resulting Fence Cutting Wars were not confined to a particular area in the West, although some areas saw more intense clashes than others. According to historian Walter Prescott Webb, \"Fence-cutter wars broke out in Texas, Wyoming, New Mexico \u2013 wherever men began to fence.\" Struggles had erupted in Texas as early as 1881, but spread to Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana in the later 1880s. For example, in Wyoming in 1883, a court ordered a big cattle company to stop fencing public lands and to remove the fences it had built around certain sections. Yet, by 1885, barbed wire had basically overrun the eastern parts of the Wyoming Territory, which meant that legal efforts to stop the fencing of the West were a losing battle. In other parts of the country, however, the Fence Cutting Wars raged on until the late 1880s and early 1890s. In Texas, the Fence Cutting Wars were especially fierce. In 1883, a drought early in the year caused non-land owning cattlemen to become desperate, since fenced properties made it difficult to find the water and grass necessary to support their herds. The conflict was worse in Texas because the state entered the union in possession of its own lands, so people felt that their right to public access was assured \u2013 the land was for everyone to share. Fence cutting soon erupted as a result of the cattlemen with vast lands using barbed wire to fence their land, cutting off roads and access to public lands. The cuttings were well organized, with armed guards posted to protect the men while they worked. In 1883, fence cutting was reported in more than half the counties in Texas. To stop the fence-cutters, the state and local authorities tried many different methods. Counties offering rewards, shootouts between landowners and fence cutters, and legal trials were all different ways in which people tried to stop the fence cutters, but the conflict persisted. The fence cutters had substantial local support, and on occasion, found powerful outside allies. For instance, the New York and Texas Land Company was making profits by selling their land to homesteaders, and hence supported fence-cutting campaigns against the cattlemen. Local newspapers lined up either for or against the fence cutters. During 1883, groups of cowboys calling themselves names such as the Owls, Javelinas, or Blue Devils, were cutting fences. By the middle of that year, ranchers were employing armed bands to battle the anti-fence cowboys, and the Texas Rangers were dispatched to the area. By the fall of 1883, more\n\nquestion: What revolutionized fencing in the West in the late 19th century?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Barbed wire revolutionized fencing in the West in the late 19th century.", "usage": 1153}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

In January 1884, Governor John Ireland called for a special assembly of the state legislature, which passed a bill mandating prison sentences for those caught fence cutting. Property owners were ordered to remove fences placed across property they did not own, provide gates every three miles, and keep the gates in good repair. By the mid 1880s, large-scale fence cutting in Texas had essentially ended. Another notable case occurred in San Miguel County, New Mexico. In the American Southwest, there were tensions between two ethnic groups, the mexicanos and Anglos, and particularly between the former and the large Anglo land companies and cattlemen taking control of public lands in the 1880s. The fence cutting movement that broke out was primarily led by smaller-scale Mexicano farmers. The conflict was sparked when Philip Millhiser purchased land from owners who possessed it under the earlier Las Vegas Land Grant. The plaintiff claimed he not only had ownership of the fields he had bought, but also to the common land of the grant. The defendants argued that it would take community assent to grant the common land to one particular owner. In the two years following 1887, during which the court case Millhiser v. Padilla was under consideration to determine the outcome of Millhiser's suit, Anglo owners continued to build new fences to enclose large portions of grant land in amounts that ranged from 1,000 to more than 10,000 acres (40 km2). In effect, the precedent of taking common lands had already been set even before the court made a ruling. These conflicts turned violent, with fence-cuttings, shootings, and the burning of a farm. In response, 21 fence cutters were indicted on 26 counts on May 3, 1889. The district attorney, the probate judge, and the assessor were opposed to the fence cutters and argued for the strongest measures possible to stop them. The presiding Judge Long was also a successful businessman who wanted to encourage economic growth in the region, and encouraged the jury to bring a stern verdict. However, vigilantes surrounded the courthouse and the jail to show their support for the indicted men, and the jury soon delivered a verdict of not guilty for one man, whereupon the charges for the other 20 were then dismissed. The Las Vegas Daily Optic, which was the leading newspaper in the county (and Republican-leaning), warned that the surge in fence cutting \"show with what jealousy the people watch the fencing of large tracts of lands, which they, with some color of reason, regard as public.\" The outbreak of fence cutting, which resulted when the legal system did not adequately address the fencing off of public lands, continued in other areas of the country as well. Farmers who filed land-use petitions grew increasingly desperate when local authorities did not respond quickly or effectively to their claims, and then resorted to more violent tactics. But in the end, these techniques were not effective in stopping the fencing of public lands, such as when organized violence died down and was replaced by political gridlock in New Mexico. The implications of the Fence Cutting Wars were numerous. They represented the last attempts toward keeping the open range alive. After the Fence Cutting Wars, Western settlement continued to grow denser and barbed wire crossed more and more of the formerly open range. Illegal fence building would become more common than fence cutting, as barbed wire continued to make its way across the region. As scholar Susanne Bentley puts it, barbed wire \"closed off land, closed people in, and enabled some people to acquire land illegally.\" The damages caused by fence-cutting was estimated to be $20 million by the fall of 1883. At least three people, as well as a Texas Ranger named Ben Warren, had died in the conflict. The spokesmen for the rich ranchers, who were abusing barb-wires to fence huge spaces to themselves, held a meeting with the fence-cutters. They settled the conflict by agreeing to remove fences from across public roads and land not owned or leased by the former, and to allow the fence-cutters passage through the gates, in return for an end to the wire-cutting. However, the effects it caused in Western economy was so problematic that it prompted Governor John Ireland to conduct a special session of the legislature to meet on January 8, 1884. The legislature made fence-cutting and pasture-burning felonies punishable by up to five years in prison. They also made fencing of public land a misdemeanor and required the removal of any such fences within six months. The conflicts of the Fence Cutting Wars, however, showed the resistance to this way of life, an unease that would be reflected in ensuing range wars throughout the late 19th century West.\n\nquestion: What revolutionized fencing in the West in the late 19th century?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Barbed wire.", "usage": 1084}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

He rounded up some of the toughest, wildest longhorns in all of the state, or that\u2019s how he described them. Others say that the cattle were docile. And there are those who wonder whether this story is true at all. But never mind. John Warne Gates \u2014 a man who later won the nickname \u201cBet\u2010A\u2010Million Gates\u201d \u2014 began to take bets as to whether these powerful, ornery longhorns could break through the fragile-\u200b\u00adseeming wire. They couldn\u2019t. Even when Gates\u2019s sidekick, a Mexican cowboy, charged at the cattle, howling curses and waving burning brands, the wire held. Bet\u2010A\u2010Million Gates wasn\u2019t so worried about winning his wagers. He was selling a new kind of fence, and the orders soon came rolling in. An advertisement from 1875 touted this fence as \u201cThe Greatest Discovery of the Age,\u201d patented by J. F. Glidden of DeKalb, Illinois. John Warne Gates described it more poetically: \u201cLighter than air, stronger than whiskey, cheaper than dust.\u201d We simply call it barbed wire. Compared to the telephone, barbed wire wreaked huge changes on the American West and much more quickly. To call barbed wire the greatest discovery of the age might seem hyperbolic, even making allowances for the fact that Alexander Graham Bell was about to be awarded a patent for the telephone. But while we think of the telephone as transformative, barbed wire wreaked huge changes on the American West and much more quickly. Joseph Glidden\u2019s design for barbed wire wasn\u2019t the first, but it was the best. Glidden\u2019s design is the same as the barbed wire you can see today. The wicked barb is twisted around a strand of smooth wire; then a second strand of smooth wire is twisted together with the first to stop the barbs from sliding around. Farmers snapped it up. Why? In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Homestead Act. It specified that any citizen \u2014 including women and freed slaves \u2014 could lay claim to up to 160 acres of land in America\u2019s western territories. All they had to do was build a home there and work the land for five years. The idea was that the Homestead Act would improve the land and improve the citizenry, creating free and virtuous hardworking landowners with a strong stake in the future of the nation. It sounds simple. But the prairie was a vast, uncharted expanse. It had long been the territory of Native Americans. After Europeans arrived and pushed west, cowboys roamed free, herding cattle over the boundless plains. So settlers needed fences, not least to keep those free-\u200b\u00adroaming cattle from trampling their crops. There wasn\u2019t much wood and certainly not enough to fence what was often called the \u201cGreat American Desert.\u201d Farmers tried growing thornbush hedges, but these were slow-\u200b\u00adgrowing and inflexible. Smooth-wire fences didn\u2019t work either \u2014 the cattle pushed through them. Barbed wire solved one of the biggest problems settlers faced, but it also sparked the ferocious \u201cfence-cutting wars.\u201d The US Department of Agriculture conducted a study in 1870 and concluded that until farmers could find fencing that worked, it would be impossible to settle the American West. The West, in turn, seethed with potential solutions: at the time, it was the source of more proposals for new fencing technologies than the rest of the world put together. The idea that emerged from this intellectual ferment was barbed wire. It changed what the Homestead Act could not. Until it was developed, private ownership of prairie land wasn\u2019t common because it wasn\u2019t feasible. While barbed wire spread because it solved one of the biggest problems settlers faced, it also sparked ferocious disagreements. The homesteading farmers were often trying to stake out property on the territory of Native American tribes. And 25 years after the Homestead Act came the Dawes Act, which forcibly assigned land to Native American families and gave the rest to white farmers. Philosopher Olivier Razac comments that the Dawes Act \u201chelped destroy the foundations of Indian society.\u201d No wonder these tribes called barbed wire \u201cthe devil\u2019s rope.\u201d Old-\u200b\u00adtime cowboys also lived by the principle that cattle could graze freely across the plains \u2014 the law of the open range \u2014 and they hated the wire. Cattle got nasty wounds and infections from running into it. When blizzards came, the cows would try to head south; sometimes they got stuck against the wire and died in the thousands.\n\nquestion: What revolutionized fencing in the West in the late 19th century?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Barbed wire.", "usage": 1089}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

When barbed-\u200b\u00adwire fences went up across the West, fights broke out. In the \u201cfence-\u200b\u00adcutting wars,\u201d masked gangs with names like the Blue Devils and the Javelinas cut the wires and left death threats warning fence owners not to rebuild. There were shoot-\u200b\u00adouts, even a few deaths. Eventually, authorities clamped down. The fence-\u200b\u00adcutting wars ended, and the barbed wire remained. \u201cIt makes me sick,\u201d said one trail driver in 1883, \u201cwhen I think of onions and Irish potatoes growing where mustang ponies should be exercising and where four-\u200b\u00adyear-\u200b\u00adold steers should be getting ripe for market.\u201d And if the cowboys were outraged, the Native Americans suffered far worse. Before barbed wire, Western settlers had legal rights over their land but no way of exerting practical control. These ferocious arguments reflected an old philosophical debate. The 17th-\u200b\u00adcentury English philosopher John Locke \u2014 a great influence on America\u2019s Founding Fathers \u2014 puzzled over the problem of how anybody might legally own land. Once upon a time, nobody owned anything; land was a gift of nature or of God. But Locke\u2019s world was full of privately owned land, whether the owner was the King or a simple yeoman. How had it become privately owned? Was it the result of a guy with a bunch of goons grabbing what he could? If so, all civilization was built on violent theft. That wasn\u2019t a welcome conclusion to Locke or his wealthy patrons. He argued that we all own our own labor. So if you mix your labor with the land that nature provides \u2014 for instance, by plowing the soil \u2014 then you\u2019ve blended something you own with something that nobody owns.
