Why? Because we may be facing a crisis as meat could disappear in the close future, Goodyear notes. When this happens, it will be a worldwide problem and will most certainly create conflicts among countries. \u201cWorld War Three will be over control of water and food\u201d.\u2026 Rachel Carson helps gather expert opinions on the dangers of the use of pesticides which is prevalent in the modern day American society. Rachel Carson argues that experts focus on the effectiveness of pesticides in killing insects rather than its effects on the environment. Rachel\u2019s work acts as an eye-opener to the world since the book portrays the use of pesticides as vicious. The book is in also informative since it points out the impacts of the rampant and dangerous practice. Rachel uses an interconnected system to bring forth her argument on conservation.\u2026 There has been an unprecedented amount of evidence that our Earth is heating up due to global warming causing hard to repair damage to the world. According to Van Jones, author of The Green Collar Economy we must take action now. The rising temperatures are melting the ice caps at alarming rates they are also allowing there to be a rise in bacterial plant diseases that ruin crops, and disease carrying insects. These insects can ruin more crops, as they are active for a much longer time. We humans add about seven billion tons of carbon to the atmosphere every year.\u2026 In his novel Feed, M. T. Anderson portrays a society so affected by capitalism, consumerism, and environmental damage, that humanity is no longer able to remember what the world was like before major corporations turned the entire human experience into a means of making a profit. As a potential future, this is entirely possible, considering the current economic and environmental climates that are suffering as a direct result of late capitalism and the disaffectedness of the corporations causing the most damage. Feed explores issues perpetuated by these major corporations that have become far more prevalent in today\u2019s world such as the effect climate change has on our planet, the preying on the sick and dying, and the harmful and often dangerous\u2026 Rachel Carson\u2019s \u201cObligation to Endure\u201d is a well informative piece about the hazardous effects implemented by the careless distribution of pesticides in an uneducated society. She exposes the dark side of these chemicals with an overall goal to raise awareness and regulate control of the substances by the government. The first goal of Rachel is to make the citizens, pesticide companies, and government aware of this serious threat. Her second goal is to not ban these insecticides, but to persuade a regulation on what amount is reasonable. Carson uses her own credibility, along with logic, and statistics to create a strong and successful argument.\u2026 Rachel Carson, a scientist and writer of \"Silent Spring\". She was very criticized by Chemical and Agriculture Industries and called as \"hysterical woman who is unqualified as a scientist\". In addition, politicians such as Tom Coburn announced his intention to block a proposed bill to honor Carson, he called her book a junk science and blame Carson for the Malaria Epidemic worldwide. Her suggestion about the indiscriminate uses of pesticides destroying the life and the ecosystem as well, was title as \"Absurd \".\u2026 Rachel Carson in her article \u201cThe Obligation to Endure\u201d argues the impact that pesticides/insecticides had upon the environment and the human health risks that were caused because of the harmful pesticides/insecticides. Carson made some interesting points which led me to think about how man is actually destroying the earth, with the help of science because of the harmful chemicals that are being used in pesticides. Society fails to realize that the pesticides being used are actually killing other animals and human species through the contaminations in it, that\u2019s made by man on earth because we humans and the animals eat those crops. The quote, \u201cThe central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man\u2019s total with substances\u2026 Not only is pollution and environmental destruction harming the wild, but also the humans that are living in ignorance. When the land and air is pumped with unnatural chemicals and animals face extinction, humans are threatening their own safety and health too. Rachel Carson reveals the effects of the food chain in Silent Spring when she describes that \u201cthe few birds seen anywhere were moribund; they trembled violently and could not fly\u201d (Carson 4). Animals are left to die from ecosystem destruction, which ultimately affects the rest of life on earth. As one animal goes into extinction, another struggles to survive in the chain, and yet another, and another; and these effects eventually reach the humans on the food chain.\u2026 During the use of DDT, after World War II, crop yields increased greatly in the United States and overseas. This is because the pesticide killed many of the insects that consumed the essential crops. Author Lillian Forman states, \u201cAfter the war, DDT helped ensure that starving Europeans, not bugs, ate the crops\n\nquestion: Why hasn't natural selection had the chance to develop defenses?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1085}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

When the chemical was made available to the American public, it was welcomed as a means of boosting agricultural production, suppressing pests, and protecting shade trees, orchards, and gardens\u201d (Forman). Due to the increase in crop production, there was a greater abundance of crops available for the citizens of the countries that used DDT as a pesticide.\u2026 How to Keep Pest from Your Land with Air Rifle Overview Pests can prove to be a real nuisance when the attack your farm.

There is a need to ban synthetic chemical pesticides. Chemical pesticides are linked to a wide range of health problems. There are short term health problems like headaches and vomiting, and there are life altering long term effects such as hormonal problems and cancer.\u2026 Cody Mertz Mrs. Bauch 8th Block 16 May 2016 Did you know that using genetically modified organisms decreases the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which decreases the risk of global warming. Not using GMOs will increase the use of pesticides, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and fertilizers. Today, I will try to persuade you why GMOs should be used in everyday farming. GMO is short for Genetically Modified Organism, which means that food and drink are injected with a genetically modified organism to give the food or drink a certain flavor or taste that it cannot make itself. Organisms can also have foreign genes inserted into them, almost the same thing as Genetically Modified Organisms but they come from animals, plants, and sometimes humans, instead of other foods (GMO Education).\u2026 Bees are the world's top pollinators. There are over 20,000 different kinds of bees, and they are unfortunately dying off due to the increase of pesticides. Pollinators transfer pollen and seeds from one flower to another, fertilizing the plant so it can grow and produce food. These insects are responsible for pollinating one third of the world's crops. Bees need to live without these inorganic forms of pesticides, so that they can produce honey and pollinate crops.\u2026 I have always been interested in climate change, in the same line as global warming. I would like to learn more about how the communities and big businesses is causing damage to the climate. I remember one of my friends told me that if you leave your water running outside in your lawn you will be fined, which came as a shock to me. I never thought of getting a fine for watering your own lawn. In our society today, human emission caused more pollution than ever; there must be a solution that we can work together to improve our health and cleaner air.\u2026\n\nquestion: Why hasn't natural selection had the chance to develop defenses?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 774}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This book highlights the human poisoning of the biosphere through chemicals aimed at pests and disease control, particularly dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). DDT pesticides were particularly harmful because as they entered the biosphere, they not only killed the bugs but also entered the food chain. DDT accumulated in the fatty tissues of animals and humans which had potential to cause cancer and genetic damage. This also contaminated world food supply as DDT can enter any animal that we eat. Despite the immense effect of DDT some insects survived and passed on their resistance resulting in tougher descendants, so more toxic insecticides needed to be\u2026 The increase in desire for perfect produce, drives the need for pesticides today. Much debate of the effects of chemicals used on commercial crops and overall long term effects on humans is an increasing concern. With the increase in advertising of organic produce, many standards of farming have been criticized. Many are claiming a large increase in risk to humans for consuming commercially grown produce, because of the chemicals used to manage such a large volume of crops. There have been many debates of the actual risk of pesticide consumption. With advancing technology and farm equipment, many types of chemical sprays and powders have been used. The actual effect of these pesticides and long term exposure can be harmful to human health.\u2026 Another point about the negative effects of pesticides is that they harm animals and have some extreme impacts on their health and the survival of the species. In a journal on how the use of pesticides endangers wildlife and the environment, prominent author, investigative journalist, and science reporter Sonia Shah explains that seemingly benign levels of pesticides impair immune function in wildlife, leading to outbreaks of disease. In recent die-offs, millions of amphibians, bees, and bats died, decimating the populations (Shah, 1). Shah describes how it does not take an exorbitant amount of agrochemicals to harm an animal. When an animal\u2019s immunity is compromised due to pesticide exposure, its body loses the ability to resist diseases,\u2026 Ever since the dawn of industrialization, humans have caused serious, irreversible damage to the biosphere. And as the world progresses and Canadians looks on, they realized the impact of their environmental damage. Sometimes new ecofriendly technology enters the market and replaces the old environment damaging one. But that is not enough, human society as a whole must completely rethink and change themselves individually to so that their actions causes minimal environmental backlash.\u2026 In America today, many people do not realize the impact they have on the environment. We come from a more educated generation, yes, but many people do not realize, that even just recycling can led to less deforestation, and ensuring that the environment of many animals is still there and safe. Much like how deforestation can negatively affect animals, it negatively affects us, less trees means less oxygen, and less oxygen, less to breathe, causing more. In Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson, she attempts to enlighten the reader on how the use of pesticides has an overall negative effect on the environment, animals and humans. Carson draws this conclusion based on her belief that humanity is ignorant, and that we are under the false impression that we are in some way superior. Following this she also suggests that we, as humans, are victimizing nature, and attempting to cure it like a disease.\u2026 Rachel Louise Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. What made Rachel Carson famous was her legacy and contribution to society which was alerting the world about the environmental effect of fertilizers and pesticides through her writings and books. This discovery affected society because after one of her books, \u201cSilent Spring\u201d came out in 1962, it proved her thesis about the harmful effects on certain pesticides and fertilizers. Rachel Carson\u2019s discovery ended up having the pesticide DDT banned which ultimately probably saved many lives. Also, Rachel Carson\u2019s discovery helped shape the growing concern for environmental help.\u2026 Rachel Carson\u2019s Man and the Stream of time possesses enlightening perspectives of nature that have been marinating in her mind for ten years. Her writing reflects upon the effects that man has on nature and the role he plays in the ever changing environment. Her sole observation is that it is man\u2019s nature to want to conquer the world, but nature is not one to be conquered. The writer affirms that nature is an entity that must be dignified, Like English poet Francis Thompson said, \u201cThou canst not stir a flower without troubling of a star.\u201d Most environmentalist would agree that nature is not stationary, we cut the trees now today, its not just the trees that disappear ten years from now. As humanity advances, we create a multitude of technologies and industries, and with these discoveries comes massive amounts of waste and destruction.

To be more specific, the central idea consists of the environmental actions that are backfiring on our population in a negative way. Furthermore, in my opinion, Rachel Carson desires to spread awareness about the harmful deeds that are destroying our environment and our society\u2019s health.\u2026 Pesticides, particularly insecticides, are often blamed for pollinator and bee losses. With packaging usually stating that it so with \u201cDangerous to bees\u201d written on many to be found on the UK market. Before a pesticide or insecticide is permitted for use they go through a rigourous research and approval procedure. This includes the pesticides\u2019 effects on some beneficial insects and the environment. How the chemicals effect the honeybees has to be assessed both inside the hives and outside while bees are foraging for nectar and pollen. However certain concern has been raised about some neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam).\u2026 Rachel Carson was a writer, scientist, and ecologist. She grew up simply in a rural river town of Springdale, Pennsylvania. Rachel Carson\u2019s mother is why she had a long love the of nature and the living world. Rachel Carson, first expressed herself as a writer and then she later became a student of marine biology. In 1929, Rachel Carson graduated from the Pennsylvania College for Women. She studied at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. In 1932, Rachel Carson, also received her MA in zoology from Johns Hopkins University. Rachel Carson was later hired by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. During the depression, Rachel Carson wrote radio scripts and got her income by writing articles on natural history for the Baltimore Sun newspaper. In\u2026 For decades, the metaphorical story of the \u201cBirds and the Bees\u201d has been told to children in order to explain sexual intercourse. Since honey bees are an important part of the fertilization process among plants, also known as pollination, this story is a good way of speaking openly about the subject without using technical terms. When a honey bee lands on a flower, their feet slip into little grooves that hold pollen sacks which they carry with them until they land upon another flower. Once landing on another flower, the pollen falls out of the sac enabling the plants to fertilize and sexually reproduce. For this reason, agriculturalists welcome the presence of honey bees among their crops. National Geographic reported \u201can estimated 14 billion U.S. dollars in agricultural crops in the United States are dependent on bee pollination.\u201d But within the past several years beekeepers have found a high population of weakened and dying honey bees. The last report of a similar issue occurring amongst the honey bees, was due to a parasitic bug called the varroa mite, but this time researchers have not found any such mite or pest and are beginning to suspect that the use of pesticides are the cause of this bee epidemic. The following research here will show how chemical pesticides are harmful to the environment, animals, and humans\u2026 Rachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. She grew up with abig appreciation for nature because her mom liked nature. She got a degree in Biology fromPennsylvania College for Women and a degree in Zoology from Johns Hopkins University. Sheworked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. She was known as a very good nature writer andwrote a lot of books about the living world and the ocean. She died in 1964 after a long fightwith breast cancer.In 1947, Time Magazine said that pesticides were good for farms, people, and homes. DDTwas a chemical that was made by scientists to kill bugs. It was absorbed through the bugs\u2019 feet.DDT paralyzed the bugs then killed them. DDT came in liquid form and powder form. In 1945,city workers\u2026 It is incredible to look at all that is being threatened in Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring. To have synthetic pesticides like DDT enter the biosphere and disrupt the natural world in the manner she describes is bewildering. Despite being so effective the damage they caused was irreversible throughout ecosystems. It was so polarizing she effectively reinvented the environmental movement, and defined who was responsible (NYT nopage). Perhaps the largest contributor to the environmental problem is human activity. Whether that is through industry, overuse of fossil fuels or over consumption, humans have caused a considerable spike in noticeable carbon dioxide emissions and damage to the biosphere. Throughout Carson\u2019s book she mentions various instances\u2026 An incident from the book that made an impact on me was the neglection from the chemist and uneducated society to think that DDT was not influential in their life, and would not\n\nquestion: Why hasn't natural selection had the chance to develop defenses?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1111}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Get a custom sample essay written according to your requirements urgent 3h delivery guaranteed Abstract The following involves the second chapter of Carson\u2019s book, Silent Spring that was written in 1962. In this chapter Carson argues persuasively the adverse impacts of pesticides upon the environment and the risks on human health and the environment associated with these \u201cgenetic invaders\u201d (Carson, 1962). Many of the extremely diverse people from Carson\u2019s audience targeted were under the impression that chemicals like DDT, at that time in history, were safe for their health. Carson reconciles and attempts to persuade the public to consider the idea that DDT, which in the 1950s and 60s was one of the many chemical pesticides being manufactured and sold to individuals for use on their home lawns, were indeed unsafe for applications on lawns and around children. Carson presents the argument suggesting perhaps human beings would not want to spray pesticides such as DDT around homes, children, and offices without ascertaining any adverse dangers and risks associated with these pesticides. Carson addresses these understandable concerns utilizing logical, emotional, and ethical appeal. Carson expresses her concerns in the thesis statement, \u201cTo a large extent, the physical form and the habits of the Earth\u2019s vegetation and its animal life have been molded by the environment,\u201d (Carson, 1962). Analysis \u201cCan anyone believe it is possible to lay down such a barrage of poisons on the surface of the earth without making it unfit for all life?\u201d (Carson, 1962) Rachel Carson\u2019s argumentative essay is written to enlighten humanity on the evil being bestowed upon the Earth\u2019s microscopic worlds and biological systems via the invasions of harmful mutating chemicals that will potentially affect future generations and their health. Carson proposes insecticides initially made to function as bug repellants and aid in protecting valuable crops has become victim to Darwin\u2019s principles. Insects adapt genetically and Carson feared that insects like mosquitos, among others types, may surpass us in their superior ability to overcome genetic challenges by bouncing back in more numerous quantities contributing to the ongoing survival of their species regardless of the genetic chemicals. If insects were suddenly able to adapt to chemicals this would mean they would also adapt to vaccines that protect us. While appealing to \u201clogos, ethos, and pathos\u201d (Paull, 2013) Carson explains how the \u201c\u2026 remaining harmful chemicals pass by underground streams\u2026 until they emerge\u2026 and work unknown harm on those who drink from once pure wells.\u201d (Carson, 1962) Unless a solution can be organized into existence these conditions will persist ultimately threatening future generations and could presumably lead to disastrous events for humanity. Carson says our obligation of endurance is essentially paired with a specific need for a responsible and logical solution to \u201cthe matter-at-hand consisting of a contaminated Earth ingrained with the ongoing contamination of rivers, streams and seas via these dangerous and lethal man-made genetic materials that get into DNA segments and clog up our primal informative circuitry\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson describes the slippery slope when she compares chemicals sprayed on croplands or forests to Strontium 90. Carson appeals to our emotions (pathos) by arousing feelings towards the future generations and safety our children; the hardships they may endure unless a solution is accomplished. Carson explains: \u201cStrontium 90, released through nuclear explosions into the air\u2026 and in time takes up its abode in the bones of a human being, there to remain until his death\u2026 similarly, chemicals sprayed on croplands\u2026 entering into living organisms\u2026 they combine into new forms that kill vegetation, sicken cattle, and work unknown harm on those who drink from once pure wells\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson subtly conveys her writing in just the right writing technique so that it grabs the reader\u2019s interest without biasing the whole article. Rachel criticizes opposing thoughts subtly by keeping it simple yet informative and persuasive; this makes it readable and proves effective in validating her point of view. Carson appeals to anyone that is concerned with the global environment and the future of humanity by focusing on what the world would be like in the absence of mutated creatures, and noticeably since it was written during the 1950s, I felt the subsequent statement made in Carson\u2019s essay was very powerful. Carson states, \u201cIt is ironic to think that man might determine his own future by something as seemingly trivial as the choice of an insect spray\u201d (Carson 1962). An example of the severity of this issue is when Rachel Carson was allowed to address the Supreme Court on this issue. Perhaps this essay also was targeted towards certain companies at the time, such as DuPont. Carson\u2019s essay foreshadows the environmental movement of the 60\u2032s and was considered among scholars to be \u201cone of the most influential\n\nquestion: Why hasn't natural selection had the chance to develop defenses?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "NOANS", "usage": 1095}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Carson appeals to the arousal of the basic emotions such as the arousal of fear in the public, but not in such a way that would overly scare someone and turn them off due to excessiveness. Carson also appeals to pathos, or the emotions, by morally questioning the \u201chighly intelligent\u201d creators of these pesticides. Carson believes illogical reasoning and poor decisions based on \u2018collapsible evidence\u2019 threaten the future existence of mankind (Carson, 1962). In psychology it is said that humans \u201cbehave based on feelings of arousal\u201d (Smith, 1984). Carson appeals to this concept of arousal in humans by stirring up emotions such as fear by suggesting these pesticides led to impure water wells, air pollution, and other negative environmental impacts that could lead to disastrous effects. Carson opens this argumentative essay with an analytical opening. Carson uses support for her thesis through-out the essay which includes one excerpt, \u201cAlong with the possibility of the extinction of mankind by nuclear war, the central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man\u2019s total environment with such substances of incredible potential for harm-substances that accumulate in the tissues of plants and animals and even penetrate the germ cells to shatter or alter the very material of heredity upon which the shape of the future depends\u201d (Carson, 1962). Furthermore, the preceding statement supports Carson\u2019s intention to present an informative, persuasive, and logical point of view without shocking or confusing the reader. Carson presents the problem calmly in the opening paragraph and states her claim as a practical approach to stop or decrease the amount of the spraying of DDT pesticides in combined efforts to stop the super races of insects like mosquitoes for example from becoming immune. Including this support for her thesis Carson argues mosquitoes becoming immune to the man-made vaccines presently available would inarguably have serious, detrimental and adverse negative impacts upon the effectiveness of the survival of our own species by rendering the adverse effects of malaria vaccines available as one negative impact resulting from spraying of DDT. Carson refers to mosquitoes as \u201cunwanted species\u201d and explains how \u201cfuture historians\u201d are presented with certain challenges (Carson, 1962). Some of these challenges will be caused from the inability of mankind to logically think on a wide scale level about the effects of using mass produced pesticides on our environment. Carson suggests genetic level tampering of the codes of insects could render us humans very susceptible to certain types of unwanted diseases. Carson writes: \u201cFuture historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind? Yet this is exactly what we have done,\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson establishes a neutral ground with the opposition upon the concluding paragraphs of her essay explaining that she was not arguing the need for insect control, \u201ccontrol must be geared to realities, not to mythical situations, and that the methods employed must be such that they do not destroy us along with the insects\u201d (Carson 1962). This is a great effort on Carson\u2019s part and portrayed a positive image that represented a valid controversial issue asking for a logical solution. Conclusion In my opinion Rachel Carson wrote a very balanced essay that was easy to read, appealed to everyone such as men, patient readers, humans, and women as well that may have been interested. \u201cThe Obligation of Endurance\u201d was a very influential piece and the world would be very different today without this essay. I especially admire Rachel Carson for her tenacity to speak publically on such a controversial topic at such a time during the 1950s. This showed enormous amounts of bravery and strength on her part as she was experiencing health problems of her own at the time of her speech to the Supreme Court in 1963. I like that Carson kept a calm clean point of view and offered valid questions that were easy to read and understand and rendered these problems capable of being solved with some critical thinking and cooperation. She did not present any \u201clow blows\u201d and did not seek to offend the opposition blindly. Carson was very clear when stating her intentions pertaining to solving this issue and this is what aided her and contributed to her success in influencing the banning of pesticide DDT in the United States and other smaller African regions following this essay; she truly is a gifted writer.

Why? Because we may be facing a crisis as meat could disappear in the close future, Goodyear notes. When this happens, it will be a worldwide problem and will most certainly create conflicts among countries. \u201cWorld War Three will be over control of water and food\u201d.\u2026 Rachel Carson helps gather expert opinions on the dangers of the use of pesticides which is prevalent in the modern day American society. Rachel Carson argues that experts focus on the effectiveness of pesticides in killing insects rather than its effects on the environment. Rachel\u2019s work acts as an eye-opener to the world since the book portrays the use of pesticides as vicious. The book is in also informative since it points out the impacts of the rampant and dangerous practice. Rachel uses an interconnected system to bring forth her argument on conservation.\u2026 There has been an unprecedented amount of evidence that our Earth is heating up due to global warming causing hard to repair damage to the world. According to Van Jones, author of The Green Collar Economy we must take action now. The rising temperatures are melting the ice caps at alarming rates they are also allowing there to be a rise in bacterial plant diseases that ruin crops, and disease carrying insects. These insects can ruin more crops, as they are active for a much longer time. We humans add about seven billion tons of carbon to the atmosphere every year.\u2026 In his novel Feed, M. T. Anderson portrays a society so affected by capitalism, consumerism, and environmental damage, that humanity is no longer able to remember what the world was like before major corporations turned the entire human experience into a means of making a profit. As a potential future, this is entirely possible, considering the current economic and environmental climates that are suffering as a direct result of late capitalism and the disaffectedness of the corporations causing the most damage. Feed explores issues perpetuated by these major corporations that have become far more prevalent in today\u2019s world such as the effect climate change has on our planet, the preying on the sick and dying, and the harmful and often dangerous\u2026 Rachel Carson\u2019s \u201cObligation to Endure\u201d is a well informative piece about the hazardous effects implemented by the careless distribution of pesticides in an uneducated society. She exposes the dark side of these chemicals with an overall goal to raise awareness and regulate control of the substances by the government. The first goal of Rachel is to make the citizens, pesticide companies, and government aware of this serious threat. Her second goal is to not ban these insecticides, but to persuade a regulation on what amount is reasonable. Carson uses her own credibility, along with logic, and statistics to create a strong and successful argument.\u2026 Rachel Carson, a scientist and writer of \"Silent Spring\". She was very criticized by Chemical and Agriculture Industries and called as \"hysterical woman who is unqualified as a scientist\". In addition, politicians such as Tom Coburn announced his intention to block a proposed bill to honor Carson, he called her book a junk science and blame Carson for the Malaria Epidemic worldwide. Her suggestion about the indiscriminate uses of pesticides destroying the life and the ecosystem as well, was title as \"Absurd \".\u2026 Rachel Carson in her article \u201cThe Obligation to Endure\u201d argues the impact that pesticides/insecticides had upon the environment and the human health risks that were caused because of the harmful pesticides/insecticides. Carson made some interesting points which led me to think about how man is actually destroying the earth, with the help of science because of the harmful chemicals that are being used in pesticides. Society fails to realize that the pesticides being used are actually killing other animals and human species through the contaminations in it, that\u2019s made by man on earth because we humans and the animals eat those crops. The quote, \u201cThe central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man\u2019s total with substances\u2026 Not only is pollution and environmental destruction harming the wild, but also the humans that are living in ignorance. When the land and air is pumped with unnatural chemicals and animals face extinction, humans are threatening their own safety and health too. Rachel Carson reveals the effects of the food chain in Silent Spring when she describes that \u201cthe few birds seen anywhere were moribund; they trembled violently and could not fly\u201d (Carson 4). Animals are left to die from ecosystem destruction, which ultimately affects the rest of life on earth. As one animal goes into extinction, another struggles to survive in the chain, and yet another, and another; and these effects eventually reach the humans on the food chain.\u2026 During the use of DDT, after World War II, crop yields increased greatly in the United States and overseas. This is because the pesticide killed many of the insects that consumed the essential crops. Author Lillian Forman states, \u201cAfter the war, DDT helped ensure that starving Europeans, not bugs, ate the crops\n\nquestion: What did Rachel Carson write?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Silent Spring", "usage": 1080}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

When the chemical was made available to the American public, it was welcomed as a means of boosting agricultural production, suppressing pests, and protecting shade trees, orchards, and gardens\u201d (Forman). Due to the increase in crop production, there was a greater abundance of crops available for the citizens of the countries that used DDT as a pesticide.\u2026 How to Keep Pest from Your Land with Air Rifle Overview Pests can prove to be a real nuisance when the attack your farm. They can destroy the crops in your farm leading to huge losses. Pests can also be a safety concern for the family.

You go to the supermarket, get your vegetables, your fruit, your bread, and take them home to eat, but most of you have been unaware that you could have been poisoning yourself all these years. There is a need to ban synthetic chemical pesticides. Chemical pesticides are linked to a wide range of health problems. There are short term health problems like headaches and vomiting, and there are life altering long term effects such as hormonal problems and cancer.\u2026 Cody Mertz Mrs. Bauch 8th Block 16 May 2016 Did you know that using genetically modified organisms decreases the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which decreases the risk of global warming. Not using GMOs will increase the use of pesticides, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and fertilizers. Today, I will try to persuade you why GMOs should be used in everyday farming. GMO is short for Genetically Modified Organism, which means that food and drink are injected with a genetically modified organism to give the food or drink a certain flavor or taste that it cannot make itself. Organisms can also have foreign genes inserted into them, almost the same thing as Genetically Modified Organisms but they come from animals, plants, and sometimes humans, instead of other foods (GMO Education).\u2026 Bees are the world's top pollinators. There are over 20,000 different kinds of bees, and they are unfortunately dying off due to the increase of pesticides. Pollinators transfer pollen and seeds from one flower to another, fertilizing the plant so it can grow and produce food. These insects are responsible for pollinating one third of the world's crops. Bees need to live without these inorganic forms of pesticides, so that they can produce honey and pollinate crops.\u2026 I have always been interested in climate change, in the same line as global warming. I would like to learn more about how the communities and big businesses is causing damage to the climate. I remember one of my friends told me that if you leave your water running outside in your lawn you will be fined, which came as a shock to me. I never thought of getting a fine for watering your own lawn. In our society today, human emission caused more pollution than ever; there must be a solution that we can work together to improve our health and cleaner air.\u2026\n\nquestion: What did Rachel Carson write?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "A desperate plea for an end to pollution and its evil that we are unknowingly releasing.", "usage": 784}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This book highlights the human poisoning of the biosphere through chemicals aimed at pests and disease control, particularly dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). DDT pesticides were particularly harmful because as they entered the biosphere, they not only killed the bugs but also entered the food chain. DDT accumulated in the fatty tissues of animals and humans which had potential to cause cancer and genetic damage. This also contaminated world food supply as DDT can enter any animal that we eat. Despite the immense effect of DDT some insects survived and passed on their resistance resulting in tougher descendants, so more toxic insecticides needed to be\u2026 The increase in desire for perfect produce, drives the need for pesticides today. Much debate of the effects of chemicals used on commercial crops and overall long term effects on humans is an increasing concern. With the increase in advertising of organic produce, many standards of farming have been criticized. Many are claiming a large increase in risk to humans for consuming commercially grown produce, because of the chemicals used to manage such a large volume of crops. There have been many debates of the actual risk of pesticide consumption. With advancing technology and farm equipment, many types of chemical sprays and powders have been used. The actual effect of these pesticides and long term exposure can be harmful to human health.\u2026 Another point about the negative effects of pesticides is that they harm animals and have some extreme impacts on their health and the survival of the species. In a journal on how the use of pesticides endangers wildlife and the environment, prominent author, investigative journalist, and science reporter Sonia Shah explains that seemingly benign levels of pesticides impair immune function in wildlife, leading to outbreaks of disease. In recent die-offs, millions of amphibians, bees, and bats died, decimating the populations (Shah, 1). Shah describes how it does not take an exorbitant amount of agrochemicals to harm an animal. When an animal\u2019s immunity is compromised due to pesticide exposure, its body loses the ability to resist diseases,\u2026 Ever since the dawn of industrialization, humans have caused serious, irreversible damage to the biosphere. And as the world progresses and Canadians looks on, they realized the impact of their environmental damage. Sometimes new ecofriendly technology enters the market and replaces the old environment damaging one. But that is not enough, human society as a whole must completely rethink and change themselves individually to so that their actions causes minimal environmental backlash.\u2026 In America today, many people do not realize the impact they have on the environment. We come from a more educated generation, yes, but many people do not realize, that even just recycling can led to less deforestation, and ensuring that the environment of many animals is still there and safe. Much like how deforestation can negatively affect animals, it negatively affects us, less trees means less oxygen, and less oxygen, less to breathe, causing more. In Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson, she attempts to enlighten the reader on how the use of pesticides has an overall negative effect on the environment, animals and humans. Carson draws this conclusion based on her belief that humanity is ignorant, and that we are under the false impression that we are in some way superior. Following this she also suggests that we, as humans, are victimizing nature, and attempting to cure it like a disease.\u2026 Rachel Louise Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. What made Rachel Carson famous was her legacy and contribution to society which was alerting the world about the environmental effect of fertilizers and pesticides through her writings and books. This discovery affected society because after one of her books, \u201cSilent Spring\u201d came out in 1962, it proved her thesis about the harmful effects on certain pesticides and fertilizers. Rachel Carson\u2019s discovery ended up having the pesticide DDT banned which ultimately probably saved many lives. Also, Rachel Carson\u2019s discovery helped shape the growing concern for environmental help.\u2026 Rachel Carson\u2019s Man and the Stream of time possesses enlightening perspectives of nature that have been marinating in her mind for ten years. Her writing reflects upon the effects that man has on nature and the role he plays in the ever changing environment. Her sole observation is that it is man\u2019s nature to want to conquer the world, but nature is not one to be conquered. The writer affirms that nature is an entity that must be dignified, Like English poet Francis Thompson said, \u201cThou canst not stir a flower without troubling of a star.\u201d Most environmentalist would agree that nature is not stationary, we cut the trees now today, its not just the trees that disappear ten years from now. As humanity advances, we create a multitude of technologies and industries, and with these discoveries comes massive amounts of waste and destruction.

To be more specific, the central idea consists of the environmental actions that are backfiring on our population in a negative way. Furthermore, in my opinion, Rachel Carson desires to spread awareness about the harmful deeds that are destroying our environment and our society\u2019s health.\u2026 Pesticides, particularly insecticides, are often blamed for pollinator and bee losses. With packaging usually stating that it so with \u201cDangerous to bees\u201d written on many to be found on the UK market. Before a pesticide or insecticide is permitted for use they go through a rigourous research and approval procedure. This includes the pesticides\u2019 effects on some beneficial insects and the environment. How the chemicals effect the honeybees has to be assessed both inside the hives and outside while bees are foraging for nectar and pollen. However certain concern has been raised about some neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam).\u2026 Rachel Carson was a writer, scientist, and ecologist. She grew up simply in a rural river town of Springdale, Pennsylvania. Rachel Carson\u2019s mother is why she had a long love the of nature and the living world. Rachel Carson, first expressed herself as a writer and then she later became a student of marine biology. In 1929, Rachel Carson graduated from the Pennsylvania College for Women. She studied at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. In 1932, Rachel Carson, also received her MA in zoology from Johns Hopkins University. Rachel Carson was later hired by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. During the depression, Rachel Carson wrote radio scripts and got her income by writing articles on natural history for the Baltimore Sun newspaper. In\u2026 For decades, the metaphorical story of the \u201cBirds and the Bees\u201d has been told to children in order to explain sexual intercourse. Since honey bees are an important part of the fertilization process among plants, also known as pollination, this story is a good way of speaking openly about the subject without using technical terms. When a honey bee lands on a flower, their feet slip into little grooves that hold pollen sacks which they carry with them until they land upon another flower. Once landing on another flower, the pollen falls out of the sac enabling the plants to fertilize and sexually reproduce. For this reason, agriculturalists welcome the presence of honey bees among their crops. National Geographic reported \u201can estimated 14 billion U.S. dollars in agricultural crops in the United States are dependent on bee pollination.\u201d But within the past several years beekeepers have found a high population of weakened and dying honey bees. The last report of a similar issue occurring amongst the honey bees, was due to a parasitic bug called the varroa mite, but this time researchers have not found any such mite or pest and are beginning to suspect that the use of pesticides are the cause of this bee epidemic. The following research here will show how chemical pesticides are harmful to the environment, animals, and humans\u2026 Rachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. She grew up with abig appreciation for nature because her mom liked nature. She got a degree in Biology fromPennsylvania College for Women and a degree in Zoology from Johns Hopkins University. Sheworked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. She was known as a very good nature writer andwrote a lot of books about the living world and the ocean. She died in 1964 after a long fightwith breast cancer.In 1947, Time Magazine said that pesticides were good for farms, people, and homes. DDTwas a chemical that was made by scientists to kill bugs. It was absorbed through the bugs\u2019 feet.DDT paralyzed the bugs then killed them. DDT came in liquid form and powder form. In 1945,city workers\u2026 It is incredible to look at all that is being threatened in Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring. To have synthetic pesticides like DDT enter the biosphere and disrupt the natural world in the manner she describes is bewildering. Despite being so effective the damage they caused was irreversible throughout ecosystems. It was so polarizing she effectively reinvented the environmental movement, and defined who was responsible (NYT nopage). Perhaps the largest contributor to the environmental problem is human activity. Whether that is through industry, overuse of fossil fuels or over consumption, humans have caused a considerable spike in noticeable carbon dioxide emissions and damage to the biosphere. Throughout Carson\u2019s book she mentions various instances\u2026 An incident from the book that made an impact on me was the neglection from the chemist and uneducated society to think that DDT was not influential in their life, and would not\n\nquestion: What did Rachel Carson write?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Silent Spring", "usage": 1106}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Get a custom sample essay written according to your requirements urgent 3h delivery guaranteed Abstract The following involves the second chapter of Carson\u2019s book, Silent Spring that was written in 1962. In this chapter Carson argues persuasively the adverse impacts of pesticides upon the environment and the risks on human health and the environment associated with these \u201cgenetic invaders\u201d (Carson, 1962). Many of the extremely diverse people from Carson\u2019s audience targeted were under the impression that chemicals like DDT, at that time in history, were safe for their health. Carson reconciles and attempts to persuade the public to consider the idea that DDT, which in the 1950s and 60s was one of the many chemical pesticides being manufactured and sold to individuals for use on their home lawns, were indeed unsafe for applications on lawns and around children. Carson presents the argument suggesting perhaps human beings would not want to spray pesticides such as DDT around homes, children, and offices without ascertaining any adverse dangers and risks associated with these pesticides. Carson addresses these understandable concerns utilizing logical, emotional, and ethical appeal. Carson expresses her concerns in the thesis statement, \u201cTo a large extent, the physical form and the habits of the Earth\u2019s vegetation and its animal life have been molded by the environment,\u201d (Carson, 1962). Analysis \u201cCan anyone believe it is possible to lay down such a barrage of poisons on the surface of the earth without making it unfit for all life?\u201d (Carson, 1962) Rachel Carson\u2019s argumentative essay is written to enlighten humanity on the evil being bestowed upon the Earth\u2019s microscopic worlds and biological systems via the invasions of harmful mutating chemicals that will potentially affect future generations and their health. Carson proposes insecticides initially made to function as bug repellants and aid in protecting valuable crops has become victim to Darwin\u2019s principles. Insects adapt genetically and Carson feared that insects like mosquitos, among others types, may surpass us in their superior ability to overcome genetic challenges by bouncing back in more numerous quantities contributing to the ongoing survival of their species regardless of the genetic chemicals. If insects were suddenly able to adapt to chemicals this would mean they would also adapt to vaccines that protect us. While appealing to \u201clogos, ethos, and pathos\u201d (Paull, 2013) Carson explains how the \u201c\u2026 remaining harmful chemicals pass by underground streams\u2026 until they emerge\u2026 and work unknown harm on those who drink from once pure wells.\u201d (Carson, 1962) Unless a solution can be organized into existence these conditions will persist ultimately threatening future generations and could presumably lead to disastrous events for humanity. Carson says our obligation of endurance is essentially paired with a specific need for a responsible and logical solution to \u201cthe matter-at-hand consisting of a contaminated Earth ingrained with the ongoing contamination of rivers, streams and seas via these dangerous and lethal man-made genetic materials that get into DNA segments and clog up our primal informative circuitry\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson describes the slippery slope when she compares chemicals sprayed on croplands or forests to Strontium 90. Carson appeals to our emotions (pathos) by arousing feelings towards the future generations and safety our children; the hardships they may endure unless a solution is accomplished. Carson explains: \u201cStrontium 90, released through nuclear explosions into the air\u2026 and in time takes up its abode in the bones of a human being, there to remain until his death\u2026 similarly, chemicals sprayed on croplands\u2026 entering into living organisms\u2026 they combine into new forms that kill vegetation, sicken cattle, and work unknown harm on those who drink from once pure wells\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson subtly conveys her writing in just the right writing technique so that it grabs the reader\u2019s interest without biasing the whole article. Rachel criticizes opposing thoughts subtly by keeping it simple yet informative and persuasive; this makes it readable and proves effective in validating her point of view. Carson appeals to anyone that is concerned with the global environment and the future of humanity by focusing on what the world would be like in the absence of mutated creatures, and noticeably since it was written during the 1950s, I felt the subsequent statement made in Carson\u2019s essay was very powerful. Carson states, \u201cIt is ironic to think that man might determine his own future by something as seemingly trivial as the choice of an insect spray\u201d (Carson 1962). An example of the severity of this issue is when Rachel Carson was allowed to address the Supreme Court on this issue. Perhaps this essay also was targeted towards certain companies at the time, such as DuPont. Carson\u2019s essay foreshadows the environmental movement of the 60\u2032s and was considered among scholars to be \u201cone of the most influential\n\nquestion: What did Rachel Carson write?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Silent Spring", "usage": 1090}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Carson appeals to the arousal of the basic emotions such as the arousal of fear in the public, but not in such a way that would overly scare someone and turn them off due to excessiveness. Carson also appeals to pathos, or the emotions, by morally questioning the \u201chighly intelligent\u201d creators of these pesticides. Carson believes illogical reasoning and poor decisions based on \u2018collapsible evidence\u2019 threaten the future existence of mankind (Carson, 1962). In psychology it is said that humans \u201cbehave based on feelings of arousal\u201d (Smith, 1984). Carson appeals to this concept of arousal in humans by stirring up emotions such as fear by suggesting these pesticides led to impure water wells, air pollution, and other negative environmental impacts that could lead to disastrous effects. Carson opens this argumentative essay with an analytical opening. Carson uses support for her thesis through-out the essay which includes one excerpt, \u201cAlong with the possibility of the extinction of mankind by nuclear war, the central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man\u2019s total environment with such substances of incredible potential for harm-substances that accumulate in the tissues of plants and animals and even penetrate the germ cells to shatter or alter the very material of heredity upon which the shape of the future depends\u201d (Carson, 1962). Furthermore, the preceding statement supports Carson\u2019s intention to present an informative, persuasive, and logical point of view without shocking or confusing the reader. Carson presents the problem calmly in the opening paragraph and states her claim as a practical approach to stop or decrease the amount of the spraying of DDT pesticides in combined efforts to stop the super races of insects like mosquitoes for example from becoming immune. Including this support for her thesis Carson argues mosquitoes becoming immune to the man-made vaccines presently available would inarguably have serious, detrimental and adverse negative impacts upon the effectiveness of the survival of our own species by rendering the adverse effects of malaria vaccines available as one negative impact resulting from spraying of DDT. Carson refers to mosquitoes as \u201cunwanted species\u201d and explains how \u201cfuture historians\u201d are presented with certain challenges (Carson, 1962). Some of these challenges will be caused from the inability of mankind to logically think on a wide scale level about the effects of using mass produced pesticides on our environment. Carson suggests genetic level tampering of the codes of insects could render us humans very susceptible to certain types of unwanted diseases. Carson writes: \u201cFuture historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind? Yet this is exactly what we have done,\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson establishes a neutral ground with the opposition upon the concluding paragraphs of her essay explaining that she was not arguing the need for insect control, \u201ccontrol must be geared to realities, not to mythical situations, and that the methods employed must be such that they do not destroy us along with the insects\u201d (Carson 1962). This is a great effort on Carson\u2019s part and portrayed a positive image that represented a valid controversial issue asking for a logical solution. Conclusion In my opinion Rachel Carson wrote a very balanced essay that was easy to read, appealed to everyone such as men, patient readers, humans, and women as well that may have been interested. \u201cThe Obligation of Endurance\u201d was a very influential piece and the world would be very different today without this essay. I especially admire Rachel Carson for her tenacity to speak publically on such a controversial topic at such a time during the 1950s. This showed enormous amounts of bravery and strength on her part as she was experiencing health problems of her own at the time of her speech to the Supreme Court in 1963. I like that Carson kept a calm clean point of view and offered valid questions that were easy to read and understand and rendered these problems capable of being solved with some critical thinking and cooperation. She did not present any \u201clow blows\u201d and did not seek to offend the opposition blindly. Carson was very clear when stating her intentions pertaining to solving this issue and this is what aided her and contributed to her success in influencing the banning of pesticide DDT in the United States and other smaller African regions following this essay; she truly is a gifted writer.

Why? Because we may be facing a crisis as meat could disappear in the close future, Goodyear notes. When this happens, it will be a worldwide problem and will most certainly create conflicts among countries. \u201cWorld War Three will be over control of water and food\u201d.\u2026 Rachel Carson helps gather expert opinions on the dangers of the use of pesticides which is prevalent in the modern day American society. Rachel Carson argues that experts focus on the effectiveness of pesticides in killing insects rather than its effects on the environment. Rachel\u2019s work acts as an eye-opener to the world since the book portrays the use of pesticides as vicious. The book is in also informative since it points out the impacts of the rampant and dangerous practice. Rachel uses an interconnected system to bring forth her argument on conservation.\u2026 There has been an unprecedented amount of evidence that our Earth is heating up due to global warming causing hard to repair damage to the world. According to Van Jones, author of The Green Collar Economy we must take action now. The rising temperatures are melting the ice caps at alarming rates they are also allowing there to be a rise in bacterial plant diseases that ruin crops, and disease carrying insects. These insects can ruin more crops, as they are active for a much longer time. We humans add about seven billion tons of carbon to the atmosphere every year.\u2026 In his novel Feed, M. T. Anderson portrays a society so affected by capitalism, consumerism, and environmental damage, that humanity is no longer able to remember what the world was like before major corporations turned the entire human experience into a means of making a profit. As a potential future, this is entirely possible, considering the current economic and environmental climates that are suffering as a direct result of late capitalism and the disaffectedness of the corporations causing the most damage. Feed explores issues perpetuated by these major corporations that have become far more prevalent in today\u2019s world such as the effect climate change has on our planet, the preying on the sick and dying, and the harmful and often dangerous\u2026 Rachel Carson\u2019s \u201cObligation to Endure\u201d is a well informative piece about the hazardous effects implemented by the careless distribution of pesticides in an uneducated society. She exposes the dark side of these chemicals with an overall goal to raise awareness and regulate control of the substances by the government. The first goal of Rachel is to make the citizens, pesticide companies, and government aware of this serious threat. Her second goal is to not ban these insecticides, but to persuade a regulation on what amount is reasonable. Carson uses her own credibility, along with logic, and statistics to create a strong and successful argument.\u2026 Rachel Carson, a scientist and writer of \"Silent Spring\". She was very criticized by Chemical and Agriculture Industries and called as \"hysterical woman who is unqualified as a scientist\". In addition, politicians such as Tom Coburn announced his intention to block a proposed bill to honor Carson, he called her book a junk science and blame Carson for the Malaria Epidemic worldwide. Her suggestion about the indiscriminate uses of pesticides destroying the life and the ecosystem as well, was title as \"Absurd \".\u2026 Rachel Carson in her article \u201cThe Obligation to Endure\u201d argues the impact that pesticides/insecticides had upon the environment and the human health risks that were caused because of the harmful pesticides/insecticides. Carson made some interesting points which led me to think about how man is actually destroying the earth, with the help of science because of the harmful chemicals that are being used in pesticides. Society fails to realize that the pesticides being used are actually killing other animals and human species through the contaminations in it, that\u2019s made by man on earth because we humans and the animals eat those crops. The quote, \u201cThe central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man\u2019s total with substances\u2026 Not only is pollution and environmental destruction harming the wild, but also the humans that are living in ignorance. When the land and air is pumped with unnatural chemicals and animals face extinction, humans are threatening their own safety and health too. Rachel Carson reveals the effects of the food chain in Silent Spring when she describes that \u201cthe few birds seen anywhere were moribund; they trembled violently and could not fly\u201d (Carson 4). Animals are left to die from ecosystem destruction, which ultimately affects the rest of life on earth. As one animal goes into extinction, another struggles to survive in the chain, and yet another, and another; and these effects eventually reach the humans on the food chain.\u2026 During the use of DDT, after World War II, crop yields increased greatly in the United States and overseas. This is because the pesticide killed many of the insects that consumed the essential crops. Author Lillian Forman states, \u201cAfter the war, DDT helped ensure that starving Europeans, not bugs, ate the crops\n\nquestion: What was the purpose of Carson's writing?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "awareness and regulation of the hazardous effects implemented by the careless distribution of pesticides in an uneducated society.

When the chemical was made available to the American public, it was welcomed as a means of boosting agricultural production, suppressing pests, and protecting shade trees, orchards, and gardens\u201d (Forman). Due to the increase in crop production, there was a greater abundance of crops available for the citizens of the countries that used DDT as a pesticide.\u2026 How to Keep Pest from Your Land with Air Rifle Overview Pests can prove to be a real nuisance when the attack your farm. They can destroy the crops in your farm leading to huge losses. Pests can also be a safety concern for the family.

There is a need to ban synthetic chemical pesticides. Chemical pesticides are linked to a wide range of health problems. There are short term health problems like headaches and vomiting, and there are life altering long term effects such as hormonal problems and cancer.\u2026 Cody Mertz Mrs. Bauch 8th Block 16 May 2016 Did you know that using genetically modified organisms decreases the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which decreases the risk of global warming. Not using GMOs will increase the use of pesticides, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and fertilizers. Today, I will try to persuade you why GMOs should be used in everyday farming. GMO is short for Genetically Modified Organism, which means that food and drink are injected with a genetically modified organism to give the food or drink a certain flavor or taste that it cannot make itself. Organisms can also have foreign genes inserted into them, almost the same thing as Genetically Modified Organisms but they come from animals, plants, and sometimes humans, instead of other foods (GMO Education).\u2026 Bees are the world's top pollinators. There are over 20,000 different kinds of bees, and they are unfortunately dying off due to the increase of pesticides. Pollinators transfer pollen and seeds from one flower to another, fertilizing the plant so it can grow and produce food. These insects are responsible for pollinating one third of the world's crops. Bees need to live without these inorganic forms of pesticides, so that they can produce honey and pollinate crops.\u2026 I have always been interested in climate change, in the same line as global warming. I would like to learn more about how the communities and big businesses is causing damage to the climate. I remember one of my friends told me that if you leave your water running outside in your lawn you will be fined, which came as a shock to me. I never thought of getting a fine for watering your own lawn.

This book highlights the human poisoning of the biosphere through chemicals aimed at pests and disease control, particularly dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). DDT pesticides were particularly harmful because as they entered the biosphere, they not only killed the bugs but also entered the food chain. DDT accumulated in the fatty tissues of animals and humans which had potential to cause cancer and genetic damage. This also contaminated world food supply as DDT can enter any animal that we eat. Despite the immense effect of DDT some insects survived and passed on their resistance resulting in tougher descendants, so more toxic insecticides needed to be\u2026 The increase in desire for perfect produce, drives the need for pesticides today. Much debate of the effects of chemicals used on commercial crops and overall long term effects on humans is an increasing concern. With the increase in advertising of organic produce, many standards of farming have been criticized. Many are claiming a large increase in risk to humans for consuming commercially grown produce, because of the chemicals used to manage such a large volume of crops. There have been many debates of the actual risk of pesticide consumption. With advancing technology and farm equipment, many types of chemical sprays and powders have been used. The actual effect of these pesticides and long term exposure can be harmful to human health.\u2026 Another point about the negative effects of pesticides is that they harm animals and have some extreme impacts on their health and the survival of the species. In a journal on how the use of pesticides endangers wildlife and the environment, prominent author, investigative journalist, and science reporter Sonia Shah explains that seemingly benign levels of pesticides impair immune function in wildlife, leading to outbreaks of disease. In recent die-offs, millions of amphibians, bees, and bats died, decimating the populations (Shah, 1). Shah describes how it does not take an exorbitant amount of agrochemicals to harm an animal. When an animal\u2019s immunity is compromised due to pesticide exposure, its body loses the ability to resist diseases,\u2026 Ever since the dawn of industrialization, humans have caused serious, irreversible damage to the biosphere. And as the world progresses and Canadians looks on, they realized the impact of their environmental damage. Sometimes new ecofriendly technology enters the market and replaces the old environment damaging one. But that is not enough, human society as a whole must completely rethink and change themselves individually to so that their actions causes minimal environmental backlash.\u2026 In America today, many people do not realize the impact they have on the environment. We come from a more educated generation, yes, but many people do not realize, that even just recycling can led to less deforestation, and ensuring that the environment of many animals is still there and safe. Much like how deforestation can negatively affect animals, it negatively affects us, less trees means less oxygen, and less oxygen, less to breathe, causing more. In Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson, she attempts to enlighten the reader on how the use of pesticides has an overall negative effect on the environment, animals and humans. Carson draws this conclusion based on her belief that humanity is ignorant, and that we are under the false impression that we are in some way superior. Following this she also suggests that we, as humans, are victimizing nature, and attempting to cure it like a disease.\u2026 Rachel Louise Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. What made Rachel Carson famous was her legacy and contribution to society which was alerting the world about the environmental effect of fertilizers and pesticides through her writings and books. This discovery affected society because after one of her books, \u201cSilent Spring\u201d came out in 1962, it proved her thesis about the harmful effects on certain pesticides and fertilizers. Rachel Carson\u2019s discovery ended up having the pesticide DDT banned which ultimately probably saved many lives. Also, Rachel Carson\u2019s discovery helped shape the growing concern for environmental help.\u2026 Rachel Carson\u2019s Man and the Stream of time possesses enlightening perspectives of nature that have been marinating in her mind for ten years. Her writing reflects upon the effects that man has on nature and the role he plays in the ever changing environment. Her sole observation is that it is man\u2019s nature to want to conquer the world, but nature is not one to be conquered. The writer affirms that nature is an entity that must be dignified, Like English poet Francis Thompson said, \u201cThou canst not stir a flower without troubling of a star.\u201d Most environmentalist would agree that nature is not stationary, we cut the trees now today, its not just the trees that disappear ten years from now. As humanity advances, we create a multitude of technologies and industries, and with these discoveries comes massive amounts of waste and destruction.

To be more specific, the central idea consists of the environmental actions that are backfiring on our population in a negative way. Furthermore, in my opinion, Rachel Carson desires to spread awareness about the harmful deeds that are destroying our environment and our society\u2019s health.\u2026 Pesticides, particularly insecticides, are often blamed for pollinator and bee losses. With packaging usually stating that it so with \u201cDangerous to bees\u201d written on many to be found on the UK market. Before a pesticide or insecticide is permitted for use they go through a rigourous research and approval procedure. This includes the pesticides\u2019 effects on some beneficial insects and the environment. How the chemicals effect the honeybees has to be assessed both inside the hives and outside while bees are foraging for nectar and pollen. However certain concern has been raised about some neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam).\u2026 Rachel Carson was a writer, scientist, and ecologist. She grew up simply in a rural river town of Springdale, Pennsylvania. Rachel Carson\u2019s mother is why she had a long love the of nature and the living world. Rachel Carson, first expressed herself as a writer and then she later became a student of marine biology. In 1929, Rachel Carson graduated from the Pennsylvania College for Women. She studied at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. In 1932, Rachel Carson, also received her MA in zoology from Johns Hopkins University. Rachel Carson was later hired by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. During the depression, Rachel Carson wrote radio scripts and got her income by writing articles on natural history for the Baltimore Sun newspaper. In\u2026 For decades, the metaphorical story of the \u201cBirds and the Bees\u201d has been told to children in order to explain sexual intercourse. Since honey bees are an important part of the fertilization process among plants, also known as pollination, this story is a good way of speaking openly about the subject without using technical terms. When a honey bee lands on a flower, their feet slip into little grooves that hold pollen sacks which they carry with them until they land upon another flower. Once landing on another flower, the pollen falls out of the sac enabling the plants to fertilize and sexually reproduce. For this reason, agriculturalists welcome the presence of honey bees among their crops. National Geographic reported \u201can estimated 14 billion U.S. dollars in agricultural crops in the United States are dependent on bee pollination.\u201d But within the past several years beekeepers have found a high population of weakened and dying honey bees. The last report of a similar issue occurring amongst the honey bees, was due to a parasitic bug called the varroa mite, but this time researchers have not found any such mite or pest and are beginning to suspect that the use of pesticides are the cause of this bee epidemic. The following research here will show how chemical pesticides are harmful to the environment, animals, and humans\u2026 Rachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. She grew up with abig appreciation for nature because her mom liked nature. She got a degree in Biology fromPennsylvania College for Women and a degree in Zoology from Johns Hopkins University. Sheworked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. She was known as a very good nature writer andwrote a lot of books about the living world and the ocean. She died in 1964 after a long fightwith breast cancer.In 1947, Time Magazine said that pesticides were good for farms, people, and homes. DDTwas a chemical that was made by scientists to kill bugs. It was absorbed through the bugs\u2019 feet.DDT paralyzed the bugs then killed them. DDT came in liquid form and powder form. In 1945,city workers\u2026 It is incredible to look at all that is being threatened in Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring. To have synthetic pesticides like DDT enter the biosphere and disrupt the natural world in the manner she describes is bewildering. Despite being so effective the damage they caused was irreversible throughout ecosystems. It was so polarizing she effectively reinvented the environmental movement, and defined who was responsible (NYT nopage). Perhaps the largest contributor to the environmental problem is human activity. Whether that is through industry, overuse of fossil fuels or over consumption, humans have caused a considerable spike in noticeable carbon dioxide emissions and damage to the biosphere.

Get a custom sample essay written according to your requirements urgent 3h delivery guaranteed Abstract The following involves the second chapter of Carson\u2019s book, Silent Spring that was written in 1962. In this chapter Carson argues persuasively the adverse impacts of pesticides upon the environment and the risks on human health and the environment associated with these \u201cgenetic invaders\u201d (Carson, 1962). Many of the extremely diverse people from Carson\u2019s audience targeted were under the impression that chemicals like DDT, at that time in history, were safe for their health. Carson reconciles and attempts to persuade the public to consider the idea that DDT, which in the 1950s and 60s was one of the many chemical pesticides being manufactured and sold to individuals for use on their home lawns, were indeed unsafe for applications on lawns and around children. Carson presents the argument suggesting perhaps human beings would not want to spray pesticides such as DDT around homes, children, and offices without ascertaining any adverse dangers and risks associated with these pesticides. Carson addresses these understandable concerns utilizing logical, emotional, and ethical appeal. Carson expresses her concerns in the thesis statement, \u201cTo a large extent, the physical form and the habits of the Earth\u2019s vegetation and its animal life have been molded by the environment,\u201d (Carson, 1962). Analysis \u201cCan anyone believe it is possible to lay down such a barrage of poisons on the surface of the earth without making it unfit for all life?\u201d (Carson, 1962) Rachel Carson\u2019s argumentative essay is written to enlighten humanity on the evil being bestowed upon the Earth\u2019s microscopic worlds and biological systems via the invasions of harmful mutating chemicals that will potentially affect future generations and their health. Carson proposes insecticides initially made to function as bug repellants and aid in protecting valuable crops has become victim to Darwin\u2019s principles. Insects adapt genetically and Carson feared that insects like mosquitos, among others types, may surpass us in their superior ability to overcome genetic challenges by bouncing back in more numerous quantities contributing to the ongoing survival of their species regardless of the genetic chemicals. If insects were suddenly able to adapt to chemicals this would mean they would also adapt to vaccines that protect us. While appealing to \u201clogos, ethos, and pathos\u201d (Paull, 2013) Carson explains how the \u201c\u2026 remaining harmful chemicals pass by underground streams\u2026 until they emerge\u2026 and work unknown harm on those who drink from once pure wells.\u201d (Carson, 1962) Unless a solution can be organized into existence these conditions will persist ultimately threatening future generations and could presumably lead to disastrous events for humanity. Carson says our obligation of endurance is essentially paired with a specific need for a responsible and logical solution to \u201cthe matter-at-hand consisting of a contaminated Earth ingrained with the ongoing contamination of rivers, streams and seas via these dangerous and lethal man-made genetic materials that get into DNA segments and clog up our primal informative circuitry\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson describes the slippery slope when she compares chemicals sprayed on croplands or forests to Strontium 90. Carson appeals to our emotions (pathos) by arousing feelings towards the future generations and safety our children; the hardships they may endure unless a solution is accomplished. Carson explains: \u201cStrontium 90, released through nuclear explosions into the air\u2026 and in time takes up its abode in the bones of a human being, there to remain until his death\u2026 similarly, chemicals sprayed on croplands\u2026 entering into living organisms\u2026 they combine into new forms that kill vegetation, sicken cattle, and work unknown harm on those who drink from once pure wells\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson subtly conveys her writing in just the right writing technique so that it grabs the reader\u2019s interest without biasing the whole article. Rachel criticizes opposing thoughts subtly by keeping it simple yet informative and persuasive; this makes it readable and proves effective in validating her point of view. Carson appeals to anyone that is concerned with the global environment and the future of humanity by focusing on what the world would be like in the absence of mutated creatures, and noticeably since it was written during the 1950s, I felt the subsequent statement made in Carson\u2019s essay was very powerful. Carson states, \u201cIt is ironic to think that man might determine his own future by something as seemingly trivial as the choice of an insect spray\u201d (Carson 1962). An example of the severity of this issue is when Rachel Carson was allowed to address the Supreme Court on this issue. Perhaps this essay also was targeted towards certain companies at the time, such as DuPont. Carson\u2019s essay foreshadows the environmental movement of the 60\u2032s and was considered among scholars to be \u201cone of the most influential\n\nquestion: What was the purpose of Carson's writing?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "To enlighten humanity on the evil being bestowed upon the Earth\u2019s microscopic worlds and biological systems via the invasions of harmful mutating chemicals.", "usage": 1117}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Carson appeals to the arousal of the basic emotions such as the arousal of fear in the public, but not in such a way that would overly scare someone and turn them off due to excessiveness. Carson also appeals to pathos, or the emotions, by morally questioning the \u201chighly intelligent\u201d creators of these pesticides. Carson believes illogical reasoning and poor decisions based on \u2018collapsible evidence\u2019 threaten the future existence of mankind (Carson, 1962). In psychology it is said that humans \u201cbehave based on feelings of arousal\u201d (Smith, 1984). Carson appeals to this concept of arousal in humans by stirring up emotions such as fear by suggesting these pesticides led to impure water wells, air pollution, and other negative environmental impacts that could lead to disastrous effects. Carson opens this argumentative essay with an analytical opening. Carson uses support for her thesis through-out the essay which includes one excerpt, \u201cAlong with the possibility of the extinction of mankind by nuclear war, the central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man\u2019s total environment with such substances of incredible potential for harm-substances that accumulate in the tissues of plants and animals and even penetrate the germ cells to shatter or alter the very material of heredity upon which the shape of the future depends\u201d (Carson, 1962). Furthermore, the preceding statement supports Carson\u2019s intention to present an informative, persuasive, and logical point of view without shocking or confusing the reader. Carson presents the problem calmly in the opening paragraph and states her claim as a practical approach to stop or decrease the amount of the spraying of DDT pesticides in combined efforts to stop the super races of insects like mosquitoes for example from becoming immune. Including this support for her thesis Carson argues mosquitoes becoming immune to the man-made vaccines presently available would inarguably have serious, detrimental and adverse negative impacts upon the effectiveness of the survival of our own species by rendering the adverse effects of malaria vaccines available as one negative impact resulting from spraying of DDT. Carson refers to mosquitoes as \u201cunwanted species\u201d and explains how \u201cfuture historians\u201d are presented with certain challenges (Carson, 1962). Some of these challenges will be caused from the inability of mankind to logically think on a wide scale level about the effects of using mass produced pesticides on our environment. Carson suggests genetic level tampering of the codes of insects could render us humans very susceptible to certain types of unwanted diseases. Carson writes: \u201cFuture historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind? Yet this is exactly what we have done,\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson establishes a neutral ground with the opposition upon the concluding paragraphs of her essay explaining that she was not arguing the need for insect control, \u201ccontrol must be geared to realities, not to mythical situations, and that the methods employed must be such that they do not destroy us along with the insects\u201d (Carson 1962). This is a great effort on Carson\u2019s part and portrayed a positive image that represented a valid controversial issue asking for a logical solution. Conclusion In my opinion Rachel Carson wrote a very balanced essay that was easy to read, appealed to everyone such as men, patient readers, humans, and women as well that may have been interested. \u201cThe Obligation of Endurance\u201d was a very influential piece and the world would be very different today without this essay. I especially admire Rachel Carson for her tenacity to speak publically on such a controversial topic at such a time during the 1950s. This showed enormous amounts of bravery and strength on her part as she was experiencing health problems of her own at the time of her speech to the Supreme Court in 1963. I like that Carson kept a calm clean point of view and offered valid questions that were easy to read and understand and rendered these problems capable of being solved with some critical thinking and cooperation. She did not present any \u201clow blows\u201d and did not seek to offend the opposition blindly. Carson was very clear when stating her intentions pertaining to solving this issue and this is what aided her and contributed to her success in influencing the banning of pesticide DDT in the United States and other smaller African regions following this essay; she truly is a gifted writer.

Why? Because we may be facing a crisis as meat could disappear in the close future, Goodyear notes. When this happens, it will be a worldwide problem and will most certainly create conflicts among countries. \u201cWorld War Three will be over control of water and food\u201d.\u2026 Rachel Carson helps gather expert opinions on the dangers of the use of pesticides which is prevalent in the modern day American society. Rachel Carson argues that experts focus on the effectiveness of pesticides in killing insects rather than its effects on the environment. Rachel\u2019s work acts as an eye-opener to the world since the book portrays the use of pesticides as vicious. The book is in also informative since it points out the impacts of the rampant and dangerous practice. Rachel uses an interconnected system to bring forth her argument on conservation.\u2026 There has been an unprecedented amount of evidence that our Earth is heating up due to global warming causing hard to repair damage to the world. According to Van Jones, author of The Green Collar Economy we must take action now. The rising temperatures are melting the ice caps at alarming rates they are also allowing there to be a rise in bacterial plant diseases that ruin crops, and disease carrying insects. These insects can ruin more crops, as they are active for a much longer time. We humans add about seven billion tons of carbon to the atmosphere every year.\u2026 In his novel Feed, M. T. Anderson portrays a society so affected by capitalism, consumerism, and environmental damage, that humanity is no longer able to remember what the world was like before major corporations turned the entire human experience into a means of making a profit. As a potential future, this is entirely possible, considering the current economic and environmental climates that are suffering as a direct result of late capitalism and the disaffectedness of the corporations causing the most damage. Feed explores issues perpetuated by these major corporations that have become far more prevalent in today\u2019s world such as the effect climate change has on our planet, the preying on the sick and dying, and the harmful and often dangerous\u2026 Rachel Carson\u2019s \u201cObligation to Endure\u201d is a well informative piece about the hazardous effects implemented by the careless distribution of pesticides in an uneducated society. She exposes the dark side of these chemicals with an overall goal to raise awareness and regulate control of the substances by the government. The first goal of Rachel is to make the citizens, pesticide companies, and government aware of this serious threat. Her second goal is to not ban these insecticides, but to persuade a regulation on what amount is reasonable. Carson uses her own credibility, along with logic, and statistics to create a strong and successful argument.\u2026 Rachel Carson, a scientist and writer of \"Silent Spring\". She was very criticized by Chemical and Agriculture Industries and called as \"hysterical woman who is unqualified as a scientist\". In addition, politicians such as Tom Coburn announced his intention to block a proposed bill to honor Carson, he called her book a junk science and blame Carson for the Malaria Epidemic worldwide. Her suggestion about the indiscriminate uses of pesticides destroying the life and the ecosystem as well, was title as \"Absurd \".\u2026 Rachel Carson in her article \u201cThe Obligation to Endure\u201d argues the impact that pesticides/insecticides had upon the environment and the human health risks that were caused because of the harmful pesticides/insecticides. Carson made some interesting points which led me to think about how man is actually destroying the earth, with the help of science because of the harmful chemicals that are being used in pesticides. Society fails to realize that the pesticides being used are actually killing other animals and human species through the contaminations in it, that\u2019s made by man on earth because we humans and the animals eat those crops. The quote, \u201cThe central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man\u2019s total with substances\u2026 Not only is pollution and environmental destruction harming the wild, but also the humans that are living in ignorance. When the land and air is pumped with unnatural chemicals and animals face extinction, humans are threatening their own safety and health too. Rachel Carson reveals the effects of the food chain in Silent Spring when she describes that \u201cthe few birds seen anywhere were moribund; they trembled violently and could not fly\u201d (Carson 4). Animals are left to die from ecosystem destruction, which ultimately affects the rest of life on earth. As one animal goes into extinction, another struggles to survive in the chain, and yet another, and another; and these effects eventually reach the humans on the food chain.\u2026 During the use of DDT, after World War II, crop yields increased greatly in the United States and overseas. This is because the pesticide killed many of the insects that consumed the essential crops. Author Lillian Forman states, \u201cAfter the war, DDT helped ensure that starving Europeans, not bugs, ate the crops\n\nquestion: What alterations did Carson want to highlight?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "contamination of man\u2019s total with substances", "usage": 1087}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

When the chemical was made available to the American public, it was welcomed as a means of boosting agricultural production, suppressing pests, and protecting shade trees, orchards, and gardens\u201d (Forman). Due to the increase in crop production, there was a greater abundance of crops available for the citizens of the countries that used DDT as a pesticide.\u2026 How to Keep Pest from Your Land with Air Rifle Overview Pests can prove to be a real nuisance when the attack your farm. They can destroy the crops in your farm leading to huge losses. Pests can also be a safety concern for the family. Some can prove to be a real danger even to human beings.\u2026 Her article is not just a warning of the plague we are unleashing on the world. It is a desperate plea for an end to pollution and its evil that we are unknowingly releasing. A world at war with itself cannot stand forever over the course of this deadly strife.

You go to the supermarket, get your vegetables, your fruit, your bread, and take them home to eat, but most of you have been unaware that you could have been poisoning yourself all these years. There is a need to ban synthetic chemical pesticides. Chemical pesticides are linked to a wide range of health problems. There are short term health problems like headaches and vomiting, and there are life altering long term effects such as hormonal problems and cancer.\u2026 Cody Mertz Mrs. Bauch 8th Block 16 May 2016 Did you know that using genetically modified organisms decreases the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which decreases the risk of global warming. Not using GMOs will increase the use of pesticides, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and fertilizers. Today, I will try to persuade you why GMOs should be used in everyday farming. GMO is short for Genetically Modified Organism, which means that food and drink are injected with a genetically modified organism to give the food or drink a certain flavor or taste that it cannot make itself. Organisms can also have foreign genes inserted into them, almost the same thing as Genetically Modified Organisms but they come from animals, plants, and sometimes humans, instead of other foods (GMO Education).\u2026 Bees are the world's top pollinators. There are over 20,000 different kinds of bees, and they are unfortunately dying off due to the increase of pesticides. Pollinators transfer pollen and seeds from one flower to another, fertilizing the plant so it can grow and produce food. These insects are responsible for pollinating one third of the world's crops. Bees need to live without these inorganic forms of pesticides, so that they can produce honey and pollinate crops.\u2026 I have always been interested in climate change, in the same line as global warming. I would like to learn more about how the communities and big businesses is causing damage to the climate. I remember one of my friends told me that if you leave your water running outside in your lawn you will be fined, which came as a shock to me. I never thought of getting a fine for watering your own lawn. In our society today, human emission caused more pollution than ever; there must be a solution that we can work together to improve our health and cleaner air.\u2026\n\nquestion: What alterations did Carson want to highlight?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "a desperate plea for an end to pollution and its evil that we are unknowingly releasing.", "usage": 786}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

This book highlights the human poisoning of the biosphere through chemicals aimed at pests and disease control, particularly dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). DDT pesticides were particularly harmful because as they entered the biosphere, they not only killed the bugs but also entered the food chain. DDT accumulated in the fatty tissues of animals and humans which had potential to cause cancer and genetic damage. This also contaminated world food supply as DDT can enter any animal that we eat. Despite the immense effect of DDT some insects survived and passed on their resistance resulting in tougher descendants, so more toxic insecticides needed to be\u2026 The increase in desire for perfect produce, drives the need for pesticides today. Much debate of the effects of chemicals used on commercial crops and overall long term effects on humans is an increasing concern. With the increase in advertising of organic produce, many standards of farming have been criticized. Many are claiming a large increase in risk to humans for consuming commercially grown produce, because of the chemicals used to manage such a large volume of crops. There have been many debates of the actual risk of pesticide consumption. With advancing technology and farm equipment, many types of chemical sprays and powders have been used. The actual effect of these pesticides and long term exposure can be harmful to human health.\u2026 Another point about the negative effects of pesticides is that they harm animals and have some extreme impacts on their health and the survival of the species. In a journal on how the use of pesticides endangers wildlife and the environment, prominent author, investigative journalist, and science reporter Sonia Shah explains that seemingly benign levels of pesticides impair immune function in wildlife, leading to outbreaks of disease. In recent die-offs, millions of amphibians, bees, and bats died, decimating the populations (Shah, 1). Shah describes how it does not take an exorbitant amount of agrochemicals to harm an animal. When an animal\u2019s immunity is compromised due to pesticide exposure, its body loses the ability to resist diseases,\u2026 Ever since the dawn of industrialization, humans have caused serious, irreversible damage to the biosphere. And as the world progresses and Canadians looks on, they realized the impact of their environmental damage. Sometimes new ecofriendly technology enters the market and replaces the old environment damaging one. But that is not enough, human society as a whole must completely rethink and change themselves individually to so that their actions causes minimal environmental backlash.\u2026 In America today, many people do not realize the impact they have on the environment. We come from a more educated generation, yes, but many people do not realize, that even just recycling can led to less deforestation, and ensuring that the environment of many animals is still there and safe. Much like how deforestation can negatively affect animals, it negatively affects us, less trees means less oxygen, and less oxygen, less to breathe, causing more. In Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson, she attempts to enlighten the reader on how the use of pesticides has an overall negative effect on the environment, animals and humans. Carson draws this conclusion based on her belief that humanity is ignorant, and that we are under the false impression that we are in some way superior. Following this she also suggests that we, as humans, are victimizing nature, and attempting to cure it like a disease.\u2026 Rachel Louise Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. What made Rachel Carson famous was her legacy and contribution to society which was alerting the world about the environmental effect of fertilizers and pesticides through her writings and books. This discovery affected society because after one of her books, \u201cSilent Spring\u201d came out in 1962, it proved her thesis about the harmful effects on certain pesticides and fertilizers. Rachel Carson\u2019s discovery ended up having the pesticide DDT banned which ultimately probably saved many lives. Also, Rachel Carson\u2019s discovery helped shape the growing concern for environmental help.\u2026 Rachel Carson\u2019s Man and the Stream of time possesses enlightening perspectives of nature that have been marinating in her mind for ten years. Her writing reflects upon the effects that man has on nature and the role he plays in the ever changing environment. Her sole observation is that it is man\u2019s nature to want to conquer the world, but nature is not one to be conquered. The writer affirms that nature is an entity that must be dignified, Like English poet Francis Thompson said, \u201cThou canst not stir a flower without troubling of a star.\u201d Most environmentalist would agree that nature is not stationary, we cut the trees now today, its not just the trees that disappear ten years from now. As humanity advances, we create a multitude of technologies and industries, and with these discoveries comes massive amounts of waste and destruction. Rachel Carson\u2019s man point is, man is ignorantly trying tame the beast, but years from\n\nquestion: What alterations did Carson want to highlight?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "alterations in man's attitude towards the environment and nature", "usage": 1103}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

To be more specific, the central idea consists of the environmental actions that are backfiring on our population in a negative way. Furthermore, in my opinion, Rachel Carson desires to spread awareness about the harmful deeds that are destroying our environment and our society\u2019s health.\u2026 Pesticides, particularly insecticides, are often blamed for pollinator and bee losses. With packaging usually stating that it so with \u201cDangerous to bees\u201d written on many to be found on the UK market. Before a pesticide or insecticide is permitted for use they go through a rigourous research and approval procedure. This includes the pesticides\u2019 effects on some beneficial insects and the environment. How the chemicals effect the honeybees has to be assessed both inside the hives and outside while bees are foraging for nectar and pollen. However certain concern has been raised about some neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam).\u2026 Rachel Carson was a writer, scientist, and ecologist. She grew up simply in a rural river town of Springdale, Pennsylvania. Rachel Carson\u2019s mother is why she had a long love the of nature and the living world. Rachel Carson, first expressed herself as a writer and then she later became a student of marine biology. In 1929, Rachel Carson graduated from the Pennsylvania College for Women. She studied at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. In 1932, Rachel Carson, also received her MA in zoology from Johns Hopkins University. Rachel Carson was later hired by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. During the depression, Rachel Carson wrote radio scripts and got her income by writing articles on natural history for the Baltimore Sun newspaper. In\u2026 For decades, the metaphorical story of the \u201cBirds and the Bees\u201d has been told to children in order to explain sexual intercourse. Since honey bees are an important part of the fertilization process among plants, also known as pollination, this story is a good way of speaking openly about the subject without using technical terms. When a honey bee lands on a flower, their feet slip into little grooves that hold pollen sacks which they carry with them until they land upon another flower. Once landing on another flower, the pollen falls out of the sac enabling the plants to fertilize and sexually reproduce. For this reason, agriculturalists welcome the presence of honey bees among their crops. National Geographic reported \u201can estimated 14 billion U.S. dollars in agricultural crops in the United States are dependent on bee pollination.\u201d But within the past several years beekeepers have found a high population of weakened and dying honey bees. The last report of a similar issue occurring amongst the honey bees, was due to a parasitic bug called the varroa mite, but this time researchers have not found any such mite or pest and are beginning to suspect that the use of pesticides are the cause of this bee epidemic. The following research here will show how chemical pesticides are harmful to the environment, animals, and humans\u2026 Rachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. She grew up with abig appreciation for nature because her mom liked nature. She got a degree in Biology fromPennsylvania College for Women and a degree in Zoology from Johns Hopkins University. Sheworked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. She was known as a very good nature writer andwrote a lot of books about the living world and the ocean. She died in 1964 after a long fightwith breast cancer.In 1947, Time Magazine said that pesticides were good for farms, people, and homes. DDTwas a chemical that was made by scientists to kill bugs. It was absorbed through the bugs\u2019 feet.DDT paralyzed the bugs then killed them. DDT came in liquid form and powder form. In 1945,city workers\u2026 It is incredible to look at all that is being threatened in Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring. To have synthetic pesticides like DDT enter the biosphere and disrupt the natural world in the manner she describes is bewildering. Despite being so effective the damage they caused was irreversible throughout ecosystems. It was so polarizing she effectively reinvented the environmental movement, and defined who was responsible (NYT nopage). Perhaps the largest contributor to the environmental problem is human activity. Whether that is through industry, overuse of fossil fuels or over consumption, humans have caused a considerable spike in noticeable carbon dioxide emissions and damage to the biosphere.

Get a custom sample essay written according to your requirements urgent 3h delivery guaranteed Abstract The following involves the second chapter of Carson\u2019s book, Silent Spring that was written in 1962. In this chapter Carson argues persuasively the adverse impacts of pesticides upon the environment and the risks on human health and the environment associated with these \u201cgenetic invaders\u201d (Carson, 1962). Many of the extremely diverse people from Carson\u2019s audience targeted were under the impression that chemicals like DDT, at that time in history, were safe for their health. Carson reconciles and attempts to persuade the public to consider the idea that DDT, which in the 1950s and 60s was one of the many chemical pesticides being manufactured and sold to individuals for use on their home lawns, were indeed unsafe for applications on lawns and around children. Carson presents the argument suggesting perhaps human beings would not want to spray pesticides such as DDT around homes, children, and offices without ascertaining any adverse dangers and risks associated with these pesticides. Carson addresses these understandable concerns utilizing logical, emotional, and ethical appeal. Carson expresses her concerns in the thesis statement, \u201cTo a large extent, the physical form and the habits of the Earth\u2019s vegetation and its animal life have been molded by the environment,\u201d (Carson, 1962). Analysis \u201cCan anyone believe it is possible to lay down such a barrage of poisons on the surface of the earth without making it unfit for all life?\u201d (Carson, 1962) Rachel Carson\u2019s argumentative essay is written to enlighten humanity on the evil being bestowed upon the Earth\u2019s microscopic worlds and biological systems via the invasions of harmful mutating chemicals that will potentially affect future generations and their health. Carson proposes insecticides initially made to function as bug repellants and aid in protecting valuable crops has become victim to Darwin\u2019s principles. Insects adapt genetically and Carson feared that insects like mosquitos, among others types, may surpass us in their superior ability to overcome genetic challenges by bouncing back in more numerous quantities contributing to the ongoing survival of their species regardless of the genetic chemicals. If insects were suddenly able to adapt to chemicals this would mean they would also adapt to vaccines that protect us. While appealing to \u201clogos, ethos, and pathos\u201d (Paull, 2013) Carson explains how the \u201c\u2026 remaining harmful chemicals pass by underground streams\u2026 until they emerge\u2026 and work unknown harm on those who drink from once pure wells.\u201d (Carson, 1962) Unless a solution can be organized into existence these conditions will persist ultimately threatening future generations and could presumably lead to disastrous events for humanity. Carson says our obligation of endurance is essentially paired with a specific need for a responsible and logical solution to \u201cthe matter-at-hand consisting of a contaminated Earth ingrained with the ongoing contamination of rivers, streams and seas via these dangerous and lethal man-made genetic materials that get into DNA segments and clog up our primal informative circuitry\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson describes the slippery slope when she compares chemicals sprayed on croplands or forests to Strontium 90. Carson appeals to our emotions (pathos) by arousing feelings towards the future generations and safety our children; the hardships they may endure unless a solution is accomplished. Carson explains: \u201cStrontium 90, released through nuclear explosions into the air\u2026 and in time takes up its abode in the bones of a human being, there to remain until his death\u2026 similarly, chemicals sprayed on croplands\u2026 entering into living organisms\u2026 they combine into new forms that kill vegetation, sicken cattle, and work unknown harm on those who drink from once pure wells\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson subtly conveys her writing in just the right writing technique so that it grabs the reader\u2019s interest without biasing the whole article. Rachel criticizes opposing thoughts subtly by keeping it simple yet informative and persuasive; this makes it readable and proves effective in validating her point of view. Carson appeals to anyone that is concerned with the global environment and the future of humanity by focusing on what the world would be like in the absence of mutated creatures, and noticeably since it was written during the 1950s, I felt the subsequent statement made in Carson\u2019s essay was very powerful. Carson states, \u201cIt is ironic to think that man might determine his own future by something as seemingly trivial as the choice of an insect spray\u201d (Carson 1962). An example of the severity of this issue is when Rachel Carson was allowed to address the Supreme Court on this issue. Perhaps this essay also was targeted towards certain companies at the time, such as DuPont. Carson\u2019s essay foreshadows the environmental movement of the 60\u2032s and was considered among scholars to be \u201cone of the most influential\n\nquestion: What alterations did Carson want to highlight?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "DDT and other chemical pesticides being unsafe to use on lawns and around children.", "usage": 1106}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Carson appeals to the arousal of the basic emotions such as the arousal of fear in the public, but not in such a way that would overly scare someone and turn them off due to excessiveness. Carson also appeals to pathos, or the emotions, by morally questioning the \u201chighly intelligent\u201d creators of these pesticides. Carson believes illogical reasoning and poor decisions based on \u2018collapsible evidence\u2019 threaten the future existence of mankind (Carson, 1962). In psychology it is said that humans \u201cbehave based on feelings of arousal\u201d (Smith, 1984). Carson appeals to this concept of arousal in humans by stirring up emotions such as fear by suggesting these pesticides led to impure water wells, air pollution, and other negative environmental impacts that could lead to disastrous effects. Carson opens this argumentative essay with an analytical opening. Carson uses support for her thesis through-out the essay which includes one excerpt, \u201cAlong with the possibility of the extinction of mankind by nuclear war, the central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man\u2019s total environment with such substances of incredible potential for harm-substances that accumulate in the tissues of plants and animals and even penetrate the germ cells to shatter or alter the very material of heredity upon which the shape of the future depends\u201d (Carson, 1962). Furthermore, the preceding statement supports Carson\u2019s intention to present an informative, persuasive, and logical point of view without shocking or confusing the reader. Carson presents the problem calmly in the opening paragraph and states her claim as a practical approach to stop or decrease the amount of the spraying of DDT pesticides in combined efforts to stop the super races of insects like mosquitoes for example from becoming immune. Including this support for her thesis Carson argues mosquitoes becoming immune to the man-made vaccines presently available would inarguably have serious, detrimental and adverse negative impacts upon the effectiveness of the survival of our own species by rendering the adverse effects of malaria vaccines available as one negative impact resulting from spraying of DDT. Carson refers to mosquitoes as \u201cunwanted species\u201d and explains how \u201cfuture historians\u201d are presented with certain challenges (Carson, 1962). Some of these challenges will be caused from the inability of mankind to logically think on a wide scale level about the effects of using mass produced pesticides on our environment. Carson suggests genetic level tampering of the codes of insects could render us humans very susceptible to certain types of unwanted diseases. Carson writes: \u201cFuture historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind? Yet this is exactly what we have done,\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson establishes a neutral ground with the opposition upon the concluding paragraphs of her essay explaining that she was not arguing the need for insect control, \u201ccontrol must be geared to realities, not to mythical situations, and that the methods employed must be such that they do not destroy us along with the insects\u201d (Carson 1962). This is a great effort on Carson\u2019s part and portrayed a positive image that represented a valid controversial issue asking for a logical solution. Conclusion In my opinion Rachel Carson wrote a very balanced essay that was easy to read, appealed to everyone such as men, patient readers, humans, and women as well that may have been interested. \u201cThe Obligation of Endurance\u201d was a very influential piece and the world would be very different today without this essay. I especially admire Rachel Carson for her tenacity to speak publically on such a controversial topic at such a time during the 1950s. This showed enormous amounts of bravery and strength on her part as she was experiencing health problems of her own at the time of her speech to the Supreme Court in 1963. I like that Carson kept a calm clean point of view and offered valid questions that were easy to read and understand and rendered these problems capable of being solved with some critical thinking and cooperation. She did not present any \u201clow blows\u201d and did not seek to offend the opposition blindly. Carson was very clear when stating her intentions pertaining to solving this issue and this is what aided her and contributed to her success in influencing the banning of pesticide DDT in the United States and other smaller African regions following this essay; she truly is a gifted writer.

Why? Because we may be facing a crisis as meat could disappear in the close future, Goodyear notes. When this happens, it will be a worldwide problem and will most certainly create conflicts among countries. \u201cWorld War Three will be over control of water and food\u201d.\u2026 Rachel Carson helps gather expert opinions on the dangers of the use of pesticides which is prevalent in the modern day American society. Rachel Carson argues that experts focus on the effectiveness of pesticides in killing insects rather than its effects on the environment. Rachel\u2019s work acts as an eye-opener to the world since the book portrays the use of pesticides as vicious. The book is in also informative since it points out the impacts of the rampant and dangerous practice. Rachel uses an interconnected system to bring forth her argument on conservation.\u2026 There has been an unprecedented amount of evidence that our Earth is heating up due to global warming causing hard to repair damage to the world. According to Van Jones, author of The Green Collar Economy we must take action now. The rising temperatures are melting the ice caps at alarming rates they are also allowing there to be a rise in bacterial plant diseases that ruin crops, and disease carrying insects. These insects can ruin more crops, as they are active for a much longer time. We humans add about seven billion tons of carbon to the atmosphere every year.\u2026 In his novel Feed, M. T. Anderson portrays a society so affected by capitalism, consumerism, and environmental damage, that humanity is no longer able to remember what the world was like before major corporations turned the entire human experience into a means of making a profit. As a potential future, this is entirely possible, considering the current economic and environmental climates that are suffering as a direct result of late capitalism and the disaffectedness of the corporations causing the most damage. Feed explores issues perpetuated by these major corporations that have become far more prevalent in today\u2019s world such as the effect climate change has on our planet, the preying on the sick and dying, and the harmful and often dangerous\u2026 Rachel Carson\u2019s \u201cObligation to Endure\u201d is a well informative piece about the hazardous effects implemented by the careless distribution of pesticides in an uneducated society. She exposes the dark side of these chemicals with an overall goal to raise awareness and regulate control of the substances by the government. The first goal of Rachel is to make the citizens, pesticide companies, and government aware of this serious threat. Her second goal is to not ban these insecticides, but to persuade a regulation on what amount is reasonable. Carson uses her own credibility, along with logic, and statistics to create a strong and successful argument.\u2026 Rachel Carson, a scientist and writer of \"Silent Spring\". She was very criticized by Chemical and Agriculture Industries and called as \"hysterical woman who is unqualified as a scientist\". In addition, politicians such as Tom Coburn announced his intention to block a proposed bill to honor Carson, he called her book a junk science and blame Carson for the Malaria Epidemic worldwide. Her suggestion about the indiscriminate uses of pesticides destroying the life and the ecosystem as well, was title as \"Absurd \".\u2026 Rachel Carson in her article \u201cThe Obligation to Endure\u201d argues the impact that pesticides/insecticides had upon the environment and the human health risks that were caused because of the harmful pesticides/insecticides. Carson made some interesting points which led me to think about how man is actually destroying the earth, with the help of science because of the harmful chemicals that are being used in pesticides. Society fails to realize that the pesticides being used are actually killing other animals and human species through the contaminations in it, that\u2019s made by man on earth because we humans and the animals eat those crops. The quote, \u201cThe central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man\u2019s total with substances\u2026 Not only is pollution and environmental destruction harming the wild, but also the humans that are living in ignorance. When the land and air is pumped with unnatural chemicals and animals face extinction, humans are threatening their own safety and health too. Rachel Carson reveals the effects of the food chain in Silent Spring when she describes that \u201cthe few birds seen anywhere were moribund; they trembled violently and could not fly\u201d (Carson 4). Animals are left to die from ecosystem destruction, which ultimately affects the rest of life on earth. As one animal goes into extinction, another struggles to survive in the chain, and yet another, and another; and these effects eventually reach the humans on the food chain.\u2026 During the use of DDT, after World War II, crop yields increased greatly in the United States and overseas. This is because the pesticide killed many of the insects that consumed the essential crops. Author Lillian Forman states, \u201cAfter the war, DDT helped ensure that starving Europeans, not bugs, ate the crops\n\nquestion: What did Carson find alarming?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "the damaging environmental and human health effects of chemical pesticides, and the concerns about the use of these pesticides in modern society.", "usage": 1101}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

When the chemical was made available to the American public, it was welcomed as a means of boosting agricultural production, suppressing pests, and protecting shade trees, orchards, and gardens\u201d (Forman). Due to the increase in crop production, there was a greater abundance of crops available for the citizens of the countries that used DDT as a pesticide.\u2026 How to Keep Pest from Your Land with Air Rifle Overview Pests can prove to be a real nuisance when the attack your farm.

There is a need to ban synthetic chemical pesticides. Chemical pesticides are linked to a wide range of health problems. There are short term health problems like headaches and vomiting, and there are life altering long term effects such as hormonal problems and cancer.\u2026 Cody Mertz Mrs. Bauch 8th Block 16 May 2016 Did you know that using genetically modified organisms decreases the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which decreases the risk of global warming. Not using GMOs will increase the use of pesticides, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and fertilizers. Today, I will try to persuade you why GMOs should be used in everyday farming. GMO is short for Genetically Modified Organism, which means that food and drink are injected with a genetically modified organism to give the food or drink a certain flavor or taste that it cannot make itself. Organisms can also have foreign genes inserted into them, almost the same thing as Genetically Modified Organisms but they come from animals, plants, and sometimes humans, instead of other foods (GMO Education).\u2026 Bees are the world's top pollinators. There are over 20,000 different kinds of bees, and they are unfortunately dying off due to the increase of pesticides. Pollinators transfer pollen and seeds from one flower to another, fertilizing the plant so it can grow and produce food. These insects are responsible for pollinating one third of the world's crops. Bees need to live without these inorganic forms of pesticides, so that they can produce honey and pollinate crops.\u2026 I have always been interested in climate change, in the same line as global warming. I would like to learn more about how the communities and big businesses is causing damage to the climate. I remember one of my friends told me that if you leave your water running outside in your lawn you will be fined, which came as a shock to me. I never thought of getting a fine for watering your own lawn.

This book highlights the human poisoning of the biosphere through chemicals aimed at pests and disease control, particularly dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). DDT pesticides were particularly harmful because as they entered the biosphere, they not only killed the bugs but also entered the food chain. DDT accumulated in the fatty tissues of animals and humans which had potential to cause cancer and genetic damage. This also contaminated world food supply as DDT can enter any animal that we eat. Despite the immense effect of DDT some insects survived and passed on their resistance resulting in tougher descendants, so more toxic insecticides needed to be\u2026 The increase in desire for perfect produce, drives the need for pesticides today. Much debate of the effects of chemicals used on commercial crops and overall long term effects on humans is an increasing concern. With the increase in advertising of organic produce, many standards of farming have been criticized. Many are claiming a large increase in risk to humans for consuming commercially grown produce, because of the chemicals used to manage such a large volume of crops. There have been many debates of the actual risk of pesticide consumption. With advancing technology and farm equipment, many types of chemical sprays and powders have been used. The actual effect of these pesticides and long term exposure can be harmful to human health.\u2026 Another point about the negative effects of pesticides is that they harm animals and have some extreme impacts on their health and the survival of the species. In a journal on how the use of pesticides endangers wildlife and the environment, prominent author, investigative journalist, and science reporter Sonia Shah explains that seemingly benign levels of pesticides impair immune function in wildlife, leading to outbreaks of disease. In recent die-offs, millions of amphibians, bees, and bats died, decimating the populations (Shah, 1). Shah describes how it does not take an exorbitant amount of agrochemicals to harm an animal. When an animal\u2019s immunity is compromised due to pesticide exposure, its body loses the ability to resist diseases,\u2026 Ever since the dawn of industrialization, humans have caused serious, irreversible damage to the biosphere. And as the world progresses and Canadians looks on, they realized the impact of their environmental damage. Sometimes new ecofriendly technology enters the market and replaces the old environment damaging one. But that is not enough, human society as a whole must completely rethink and change themselves individually to so that their actions causes minimal environmental backlash.\u2026 In America today, many people do not realize the impact they have on the environment. We come from a more educated generation, yes, but many people do not realize, that even just recycling can led to less deforestation, and ensuring that the environment of many animals is still there and safe. Much like how deforestation can negatively affect animals, it negatively affects us, less trees means less oxygen, and less oxygen, less to breathe, causing more. In Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson, she attempts to enlighten the reader on how the use of pesticides has an overall negative effect on the environment, animals and humans. Carson draws this conclusion based on her belief that humanity is ignorant, and that we are under the false impression that we are in some way superior. Following this she also suggests that we, as humans, are victimizing nature, and attempting to cure it like a disease.\u2026 Rachel Louise Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. What made Rachel Carson famous was her legacy and contribution to society which was alerting the world about the environmental effect of fertilizers and pesticides through her writings and books. This discovery affected society because after one of her books, \u201cSilent Spring\u201d came out in 1962, it proved her thesis about the harmful effects on certain pesticides and fertilizers. Rachel Carson\u2019s discovery ended up having the pesticide DDT banned which ultimately probably saved many lives. Also, Rachel Carson\u2019s discovery helped shape the growing concern for environmental help.\u2026 Rachel Carson\u2019s Man and the Stream of time possesses enlightening perspectives of nature that have been marinating in her mind for ten years. Her writing reflects upon the effects that man has on nature and the role he plays in the ever changing environment. Her sole observation is that it is man\u2019s nature to want to conquer the world, but nature is not one to be conquered. The writer affirms that nature is an entity that must be dignified, Like English poet Francis Thompson said, \u201cThou canst not stir a flower without troubling of a star.\u201d Most environmentalist would agree that nature is not stationary, we cut the trees now today, its not just the trees that disappear ten years from now. As humanity advances, we create a multitude of technologies and industries, and with these discoveries comes massive amounts of waste and destruction.

To be more specific, the central idea consists of the environmental actions that are backfiring on our population in a negative way. Furthermore, in my opinion, Rachel Carson desires to spread awareness about the harmful deeds that are destroying our environment and our society\u2019s health.\u2026 Pesticides, particularly insecticides, are often blamed for pollinator and bee losses. With packaging usually stating that it so with \u201cDangerous to bees\u201d written on many to be found on the UK market. Before a pesticide or insecticide is permitted for use they go through a rigourous research and approval procedure. This includes the pesticides\u2019 effects on some beneficial insects and the environment. How the chemicals effect the honeybees has to be assessed both inside the hives and outside while bees are foraging for nectar and pollen. However certain concern has been raised about some neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam).\u2026 Rachel Carson was a writer, scientist, and ecologist. She grew up simply in a rural river town of Springdale, Pennsylvania. Rachel Carson\u2019s mother is why she had a long love the of nature and the living world. Rachel Carson, first expressed herself as a writer and then she later became a student of marine biology. In 1929, Rachel Carson graduated from the Pennsylvania College for Women. She studied at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. In 1932, Rachel Carson, also received her MA in zoology from Johns Hopkins University. Rachel Carson was later hired by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. During the depression, Rachel Carson wrote radio scripts and got her income by writing articles on natural history for the Baltimore Sun newspaper. In\u2026 For decades, the metaphorical story of the \u201cBirds and the Bees\u201d has been told to children in order to explain sexual intercourse. Since honey bees are an important part of the fertilization process among plants, also known as pollination, this story is a good way of speaking openly about the subject without using technical terms. When a honey bee lands on a flower, their feet slip into little grooves that hold pollen sacks which they carry with them until they land upon another flower. Once landing on another flower, the pollen falls out of the sac enabling the plants to fertilize and sexually reproduce. For this reason, agriculturalists welcome the presence of honey bees among their crops. National Geographic reported \u201can estimated 14 billion U.S. dollars in agricultural crops in the United States are dependent on bee pollination.\u201d But within the past several years beekeepers have found a high population of weakened and dying honey bees. The last report of a similar issue occurring amongst the honey bees, was due to a parasitic bug called the varroa mite, but this time researchers have not found any such mite or pest and are beginning to suspect that the use of pesticides are the cause of this bee epidemic. The following research here will show how chemical pesticides are harmful to the environment, animals, and humans\u2026 Rachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. She grew up with abig appreciation for nature because her mom liked nature. She got a degree in Biology fromPennsylvania College for Women and a degree in Zoology from Johns Hopkins University. Sheworked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. She was known as a very good nature writer andwrote a lot of books about the living world and the ocean. She died in 1964 after a long fightwith breast cancer.In 1947, Time Magazine said that pesticides were good for farms, people, and homes. DDTwas a chemical that was made by scientists to kill bugs. It was absorbed through the bugs\u2019 feet.DDT paralyzed the bugs then killed them. DDT came in liquid form and powder form. In 1945,city workers\u2026 It is incredible to look at all that is being threatened in Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring. To have synthetic pesticides like DDT enter the biosphere and disrupt the natural world in the manner she describes is bewildering. Despite being so effective the damage they caused was irreversible throughout ecosystems. It was so polarizing she effectively reinvented the environmental movement, and defined who was responsible (NYT nopage). Perhaps the largest contributor to the environmental problem is human activity. Whether that is through industry, overuse of fossil fuels or over consumption, humans have caused a considerable spike in noticeable carbon dioxide emissions and damage to the biosphere.

Get a custom sample essay written according to your requirements urgent 3h delivery guaranteed Abstract The following involves the second chapter of Carson\u2019s book, Silent Spring that was written in 1962. In this chapter Carson argues persuasively the adverse impacts of pesticides upon the environment and the risks on human health and the environment associated with these \u201cgenetic invaders\u201d (Carson, 1962). Many of the extremely diverse people from Carson\u2019s audience targeted were under the impression that chemicals like DDT, at that time in history, were safe for their health. Carson reconciles and attempts to persuade the public to consider the idea that DDT, which in the 1950s and 60s was one of the many chemical pesticides being manufactured and sold to individuals for use on their home lawns, were indeed unsafe for applications on lawns and around children. Carson presents the argument suggesting perhaps human beings would not want to spray pesticides such as DDT around homes, children, and offices without ascertaining any adverse dangers and risks associated with these pesticides. Carson addresses these understandable concerns utilizing logical, emotional, and ethical appeal. Carson expresses her concerns in the thesis statement, \u201cTo a large extent, the physical form and the habits of the Earth\u2019s vegetation and its animal life have been molded by the environment,\u201d (Carson, 1962). Analysis \u201cCan anyone believe it is possible to lay down such a barrage of poisons on the surface of the earth without making it unfit for all life?\u201d (Carson, 1962) Rachel Carson\u2019s argumentative essay is written to enlighten humanity on the evil being bestowed upon the Earth\u2019s microscopic worlds and biological systems via the invasions of harmful mutating chemicals that will potentially affect future generations and their health. Carson proposes insecticides initially made to function as bug repellants and aid in protecting valuable crops has become victim to Darwin\u2019s principles. Insects adapt genetically and Carson feared that insects like mosquitos, among others types, may surpass us in their superior ability to overcome genetic challenges by bouncing back in more numerous quantities contributing to the ongoing survival of their species regardless of the genetic chemicals. If insects were suddenly able to adapt to chemicals this would mean they would also adapt to vaccines that protect us. While appealing to \u201clogos, ethos, and pathos\u201d (Paull, 2013) Carson explains how the \u201c\u2026 remaining harmful chemicals pass by underground streams\u2026 until they emerge\u2026 and work unknown harm on those who drink from once pure wells.\u201d (Carson, 1962) Unless a solution can be organized into existence these conditions will persist ultimately threatening future generations and could presumably lead to disastrous events for humanity. Carson says our obligation of endurance is essentially paired with a specific need for a responsible and logical solution to \u201cthe matter-at-hand consisting of a contaminated Earth ingrained with the ongoing contamination of rivers, streams and seas via these dangerous and lethal man-made genetic materials that get into DNA segments and clog up our primal informative circuitry\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson describes the slippery slope when she compares chemicals sprayed on croplands or forests to Strontium 90. Carson appeals to our emotions (pathos) by arousing feelings towards the future generations and safety our children; the hardships they may endure unless a solution is accomplished. Carson explains: \u201cStrontium 90, released through nuclear explosions into the air\u2026 and in time takes up its abode in the bones of a human being, there to remain until his death\u2026 similarly, chemicals sprayed on croplands\u2026 entering into living organisms\u2026 they combine into new forms that kill vegetation, sicken cattle, and work unknown harm on those who drink from once pure wells\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson subtly conveys her writing in just the right writing technique so that it grabs the reader\u2019s interest without biasing the whole article. Rachel criticizes opposing thoughts subtly by keeping it simple yet informative and persuasive; this makes it readable and proves effective in validating her point of view. Carson appeals to anyone that is concerned with the global environment and the future of humanity by focusing on what the world would be like in the absence of mutated creatures, and noticeably since it was written during the 1950s, I felt the subsequent statement made in Carson\u2019s essay was very powerful. Carson states, \u201cIt is ironic to think that man might determine his own future by something as seemingly trivial as the choice of an insect spray\u201d (Carson 1962). An example of the severity of this issue is when Rachel Carson was allowed to address the Supreme Court on this issue. Perhaps this essay also was targeted towards certain companies at the time, such as DuPont. Carson\u2019s essay foreshadows the environmental movement of the 60\u2032s and was considered among scholars to be \u201cone of the most influential\n\nquestion: What did Carson find alarming?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Use of harmful mutating chemicals that affect future generations and their health", "usage": 1099}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Carson appeals to the arousal of the basic emotions such as the arousal of fear in the public, but not in such a way that would overly scare someone and turn them off due to excessiveness. Carson also appeals to pathos, or the emotions, by morally questioning the \u201chighly intelligent\u201d creators of these pesticides. Carson believes illogical reasoning and poor decisions based on \u2018collapsible evidence\u2019 threaten the future existence of mankind (Carson, 1962). In psychology it is said that humans \u201cbehave based on feelings of arousal\u201d (Smith, 1984). Carson appeals to this concept of arousal in humans by stirring up emotions such as fear by suggesting these pesticides led to impure water wells, air pollution, and other negative environmental impacts that could lead to disastrous effects. Carson opens this argumentative essay with an analytical opening. Carson uses support for her thesis through-out the essay which includes one excerpt, \u201cAlong with the possibility of the extinction of mankind by nuclear war, the central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man\u2019s total environment with such substances of incredible potential for harm-substances that accumulate in the tissues of plants and animals and even penetrate the germ cells to shatter or alter the very material of heredity upon which the shape of the future depends\u201d (Carson, 1962). Furthermore, the preceding statement supports Carson\u2019s intention to present an informative, persuasive, and logical point of view without shocking or confusing the reader. Carson presents the problem calmly in the opening paragraph and states her claim as a practical approach to stop or decrease the amount of the spraying of DDT pesticides in combined efforts to stop the super races of insects like mosquitoes for example from becoming immune. Including this support for her thesis Carson argues mosquitoes becoming immune to the man-made vaccines presently available would inarguably have serious, detrimental and adverse negative impacts upon the effectiveness of the survival of our own species by rendering the adverse effects of malaria vaccines available as one negative impact resulting from spraying of DDT. Carson refers to mosquitoes as \u201cunwanted species\u201d and explains how \u201cfuture historians\u201d are presented with certain challenges (Carson, 1962). Some of these challenges will be caused from the inability of mankind to logically think on a wide scale level about the effects of using mass produced pesticides on our environment. Carson suggests genetic level tampering of the codes of insects could render us humans very susceptible to certain types of unwanted diseases. Carson writes: \u201cFuture historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind? Yet this is exactly what we have done,\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson establishes a neutral ground with the opposition upon the concluding paragraphs of her essay explaining that she was not arguing the need for insect control, \u201ccontrol must be geared to realities, not to mythical situations, and that the methods employed must be such that they do not destroy us along with the insects\u201d (Carson 1962). This is a great effort on Carson\u2019s part and portrayed a positive image that represented a valid controversial issue asking for a logical solution. Conclusion In my opinion Rachel Carson wrote a very balanced essay that was easy to read, appealed to everyone such as men, patient readers, humans, and women as well that may have been interested. \u201cThe Obligation of Endurance\u201d was a very influential piece and the world would be very different today without this essay. I especially admire Rachel Carson for her tenacity to speak publically on such a controversial topic at such a time during the 1950s. This showed enormous amounts of bravery and strength on her part as she was experiencing health problems of her own at the time of her speech to the Supreme Court in 1963. I like that Carson kept a calm clean point of view and offered valid questions that were easy to read and understand and rendered these problems capable of being solved with some critical thinking and cooperation. She did not present any \u201clow blows\u201d and did not seek to offend the opposition blindly. Carson was very clear when stating her intentions pertaining to solving this issue and this is what aided her and contributed to her success in influencing the banning of pesticide DDT in the United States and other smaller African regions following this essay; she truly is a gifted writer.

Why? Because we may be facing a crisis as meat could disappear in the close future, Goodyear notes. When this happens, it will be a worldwide problem and will most certainly create conflicts among countries. \u201cWorld War Three will be over control of water and food\u201d.\u2026 Rachel Carson helps gather expert opinions on the dangers of the use of pesticides which is prevalent in the modern day American society. Rachel Carson argues that experts focus on the effectiveness of pesticides in killing insects rather than its effects on the environment. Rachel\u2019s work acts as an eye-opener to the world since the book portrays the use of pesticides as vicious. The book is in also informative since it points out the impacts of the rampant and dangerous practice. Rachel uses an interconnected system to bring forth her argument on conservation.\u2026 There has been an unprecedented amount of evidence that our Earth is heating up due to global warming causing hard to repair damage to the world. According to Van Jones, author of The Green Collar Economy we must take action now. The rising temperatures are melting the ice caps at alarming rates they are also allowing there to be a rise in bacterial plant diseases that ruin crops, and disease carrying insects. These insects can ruin more crops, as they are active for a much longer time. We humans add about seven billion tons of carbon to the atmosphere every year.\u2026 In his novel Feed, M. T. Anderson portrays a society so affected by capitalism, consumerism, and environmental damage, that humanity is no longer able to remember what the world was like before major corporations turned the entire human experience into a means of making a profit. As a potential future, this is entirely possible, considering the current economic and environmental climates that are suffering as a direct result of late capitalism and the disaffectedness of the corporations causing the most damage. Feed explores issues perpetuated by these major corporations that have become far more prevalent in today\u2019s world such as the effect climate change has on our planet, the preying on the sick and dying, and the harmful and often dangerous\u2026 Rachel Carson\u2019s \u201cObligation to Endure\u201d is a well informative piece about the hazardous effects implemented by the careless distribution of pesticides in an uneducated society. She exposes the dark side of these chemicals with an overall goal to raise awareness and regulate control of the substances by the government. The first goal of Rachel is to make the citizens, pesticide companies, and government aware of this serious threat. Her second goal is to not ban these insecticides, but to persuade a regulation on what amount is reasonable. Carson uses her own credibility, along with logic, and statistics to create a strong and successful argument.\u2026 Rachel Carson, a scientist and writer of \"Silent Spring\". She was very criticized by Chemical and Agriculture Industries and called as \"hysterical woman who is unqualified as a scientist\". In addition, politicians such as Tom Coburn announced his intention to block a proposed bill to honor Carson, he called her book a junk science and blame Carson for the Malaria Epidemic worldwide. Her suggestion about the indiscriminate uses of pesticides destroying the life and the ecosystem as well, was title as \"Absurd \".\u2026 Rachel Carson in her article \u201cThe Obligation to Endure\u201d argues the impact that pesticides/insecticides had upon the environment and the human health risks that were caused because of the harmful pesticides/insecticides. Carson made some interesting points which led me to think about how man is actually destroying the earth, with the help of science because of the harmful chemicals that are being used in pesticides. Society fails to realize that the pesticides being used are actually killing other animals and human species through the contaminations in it, that\u2019s made by man on earth because we humans and the animals eat those crops. The quote, \u201cThe central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man\u2019s total with substances\u2026 Not only is pollution and environmental destruction harming the wild, but also the humans that are living in ignorance. When the land and air is pumped with unnatural chemicals and animals face extinction, humans are threatening their own safety and health too. Rachel Carson reveals the effects of the food chain in Silent Spring when she describes that \u201cthe few birds seen anywhere were moribund; they trembled violently and could not fly\u201d (Carson 4). Animals are left to die from ecosystem destruction, which ultimately affects the rest of life on earth. As one animal goes into extinction, another struggles to survive in the chain, and yet another, and another; and these effects eventually reach the humans on the food chain.\u2026 During the use of DDT, after World War II, crop yields increased greatly in the United States and overseas. This is because the pesticide killed many of the insects that consumed the essential crops. Author Lillian Forman states, \u201cAfter the war, DDT helped ensure that starving Europeans, not bugs, ate the crops\n\nquestion: What is the aim of 'The Obligation to Endure'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "To raise awareness of the hazardous effects of pesticides on the environment.", "usage": 1098}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

When the chemical was made available to the American public, it was welcomed as a means of boosting agricultural production, suppressing pests, and protecting shade trees, orchards, and gardens\u201d (Forman).

You go to the supermarket, get your vegetables, your fruit, your bread, and take them home to eat, but most of you have been unaware that you could have been poisoning yourself all these years. There is a need to ban synthetic chemical pesticides. Chemical pesticides are linked to a wide range of health problems. There are short term health problems like headaches and vomiting, and there are life altering long term effects such as hormonal problems and cancer.\u2026 Cody Mertz Mrs. Bauch 8th Block 16 May 2016 Did you know that using genetically modified organisms decreases the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which decreases the risk of global warming. Not using GMOs will increase the use of pesticides, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and fertilizers. Today, I will try to persuade you why GMOs should be used in everyday farming. GMO is short for Genetically Modified Organism, which means that food and drink are injected with a genetically modified organism to give the food or drink a certain flavor or taste that it cannot make itself. Organisms can also have foreign genes inserted into them, almost the same thing as Genetically Modified Organisms but they come from animals, plants, and sometimes humans, instead of other foods (GMO Education).\u2026 Bees are the world's top pollinators. There are over 20,000 different kinds of bees, and they are unfortunately dying off due to the increase of pesticides. Pollinators transfer pollen and seeds from one flower to another, fertilizing the plant so it can grow and produce food. These insects are responsible for pollinating one third of the world's crops. Bees need to live without these inorganic forms of pesticides, so that they can produce honey and pollinate crops.\u2026 I have always been interested in climate change, in the same line as global warming. I would like to learn more about how the communities and big businesses is causing damage to the climate. I remember one of my friends told me that if you leave your water running outside in your lawn you will be fined, which came as a shock to me. I never thought of getting a fine for watering your own lawn.

This book highlights the human poisoning of the biosphere through chemicals aimed at pests and disease control, particularly dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). DDT pesticides were particularly harmful because as they entered the biosphere, they not only killed the bugs but also entered the food chain. DDT accumulated in the fatty tissues of animals and humans which had potential to cause cancer and genetic damage. This also contaminated world food supply as DDT can enter any animal that we eat. Despite the immense effect of DDT some insects survived and passed on their resistance resulting in tougher descendants, so more toxic insecticides needed to be\u2026 The increase in desire for perfect produce, drives the need for pesticides today. Much debate of the effects of chemicals used on commercial crops and overall long term effects on humans is an increasing concern. With the increase in advertising of organic produce, many standards of farming have been criticized. Many are claiming a large increase in risk to humans for consuming commercially grown produce, because of the chemicals used to manage such a large volume of crops. There have been many debates of the actual risk of pesticide consumption. With advancing technology and farm equipment, many types of chemical sprays and powders have been used. The actual effect of these pesticides and long term exposure can be harmful to human health.\u2026 Another point about the negative effects of pesticides is that they harm animals and have some extreme impacts on their health and the survival of the species. In a journal on how the use of pesticides endangers wildlife and the environment, prominent author, investigative journalist, and science reporter Sonia Shah explains that seemingly benign levels of pesticides impair immune function in wildlife, leading to outbreaks of disease. In recent die-offs, millions of amphibians, bees, and bats died, decimating the populations (Shah, 1). Shah describes how it does not take an exorbitant amount of agrochemicals to harm an animal. When an animal\u2019s immunity is compromised due to pesticide exposure, its body loses the ability to resist diseases,\u2026 Ever since the dawn of industrialization, humans have caused serious, irreversible damage to the biosphere. And as the world progresses and Canadians looks on, they realized the impact of their environmental damage. Sometimes new ecofriendly technology enters the market and replaces the old environment damaging one. But that is not enough, human society as a whole must completely rethink and change themselves individually to so that their actions causes minimal environmental backlash.\u2026 In America today, many people do not realize the impact they have on the environment. We come from a more educated generation, yes, but many people do not realize, that even just recycling can led to less deforestation, and ensuring that the environment of many animals is still there and safe. Much like how deforestation can negatively affect animals, it negatively affects us, less trees means less oxygen, and less oxygen, less to breathe, causing more. In Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson, she attempts to enlighten the reader on how the use of pesticides has an overall negative effect on the environment, animals and humans. Carson draws this conclusion based on her belief that humanity is ignorant, and that we are under the false impression that we are in some way superior. Following this she also suggests that we, as humans, are victimizing nature, and attempting to cure it like a disease.\u2026 Rachel Louise Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. What made Rachel Carson famous was her legacy and contribution to society which was alerting the world about the environmental effect of fertilizers and pesticides through her writings and books. This discovery affected society because after one of her books, \u201cSilent Spring\u201d came out in 1962, it proved her thesis about the harmful effects on certain pesticides and fertilizers. Rachel Carson\u2019s discovery ended up having the pesticide DDT banned which ultimately probably saved many lives. Also, Rachel Carson\u2019s discovery helped shape the growing concern for environmental help.\u2026 Rachel Carson\u2019s Man and the Stream of time possesses enlightening perspectives of nature that have been marinating in her mind for ten years. Her writing reflects upon the effects that man has on nature and the role he plays in the ever changing environment. Her sole observation is that it is man\u2019s nature to want to conquer the world, but nature is not one to be conquered. The writer affirms that nature is an entity that must be dignified, Like English poet Francis Thompson said, \u201cThou canst not stir a flower without troubling of a star.\u201d Most environmentalist would agree that nature is not stationary, we cut the trees now today, its not just the trees that disappear ten years from now. As humanity advances, we create a multitude of technologies and industries, and with these discoveries comes massive amounts of waste and destruction. Rachel Carson\u2019s man point is, man is ignorantly trying tame the beast, but years from\n\nquestion: What is the aim of 'The Obligation to Endure'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "Human society as a whole must completely rethink and change themselves individually to so that their actions causes minimal environmental backlash.", "usage": 1120}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

To be more specific, the central idea consists of the environmental actions that are backfiring on our population in a negative way. Furthermore, in my opinion, Rachel Carson desires to spread awareness about the harmful deeds that are destroying our environment and our society\u2019s health.\u2026 Pesticides, particularly insecticides, are often blamed for pollinator and bee losses. With packaging usually stating that it so with \u201cDangerous to bees\u201d written on many to be found on the UK market. Before a pesticide or insecticide is permitted for use they go through a rigourous research and approval procedure. This includes the pesticides\u2019 effects on some beneficial insects and the environment. How the chemicals effect the honeybees has to be assessed both inside the hives and outside while bees are foraging for nectar and pollen. However certain concern has been raised about some neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam).\u2026 Rachel Carson was a writer, scientist, and ecologist. She grew up simply in a rural river town of Springdale, Pennsylvania. Rachel Carson\u2019s mother is why she had a long love the of nature and the living world. Rachel Carson, first expressed herself as a writer and then she later became a student of marine biology. In 1929, Rachel Carson graduated from the Pennsylvania College for Women. She studied at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. In 1932, Rachel Carson, also received her MA in zoology from Johns Hopkins University. Rachel Carson was later hired by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. During the depression, Rachel Carson wrote radio scripts and got her income by writing articles on natural history for the Baltimore Sun newspaper. In\u2026 For decades, the metaphorical story of the \u201cBirds and the Bees\u201d has been told to children in order to explain sexual intercourse. Since honey bees are an important part of the fertilization process among plants, also known as pollination, this story is a good way of speaking openly about the subject without using technical terms. When a honey bee lands on a flower, their feet slip into little grooves that hold pollen sacks which they carry with them until they land upon another flower. Once landing on another flower, the pollen falls out of the sac enabling the plants to fertilize and sexually reproduce. For this reason, agriculturalists welcome the presence of honey bees among their crops. National Geographic reported \u201can estimated 14 billion U.S. dollars in agricultural crops in the United States are dependent on bee pollination.\u201d But within the past several years beekeepers have found a high population of weakened and dying honey bees. The last report of a similar issue occurring amongst the honey bees, was due to a parasitic bug called the varroa mite, but this time researchers have not found any such mite or pest and are beginning to suspect that the use of pesticides are the cause of this bee epidemic. The following research here will show how chemical pesticides are harmful to the environment, animals, and humans\u2026 Rachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania. She grew up with abig appreciation for nature because her mom liked nature. She got a degree in Biology fromPennsylvania College for Women and a degree in Zoology from Johns Hopkins University. Sheworked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. She was known as a very good nature writer andwrote a lot of books about the living world and the ocean. She died in 1964 after a long fightwith breast cancer.In 1947, Time Magazine said that pesticides were good for farms, people, and homes. DDTwas a chemical that was made by scientists to kill bugs. It was absorbed through the bugs\u2019 feet.DDT paralyzed the bugs then killed them. DDT came in liquid form and powder form. In 1945,city workers\u2026 It is incredible to look at all that is being threatened in Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring. To have synthetic pesticides like DDT enter the biosphere and disrupt the natural world in the manner she describes is bewildering. Despite being so effective the damage they caused was irreversible throughout ecosystems. It was so polarizing she effectively reinvented the environmental movement, and defined who was responsible (NYT nopage). Perhaps the largest contributor to the environmental problem is human activity. Whether that is through industry, overuse of fossil fuels or over consumption, humans have caused a considerable spike in noticeable carbon dioxide emissions and damage to the biosphere. Throughout Carson\u2019s book she mentions various instances\u2026 An incident from the book that made an impact on me was the neglection from the chemist and uneducated society to think that DDT was not influential in their life, and would not\n\nquestion: What is the aim of 'The Obligation to Endure'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "To spread awareness about the harmful deeds that are destroying our environment and our society\u2019s health.", "usage": 1129}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Get a custom sample essay written according to your requirements urgent 3h delivery guaranteed Abstract The following involves the second chapter of Carson\u2019s book, Silent Spring that was written in 1962. In this chapter Carson argues persuasively the adverse impacts of pesticides upon the environment and the risks on human health and the environment associated with these \u201cgenetic invaders\u201d (Carson, 1962). Many of the extremely diverse people from Carson\u2019s audience targeted were under the impression that chemicals like DDT, at that time in history, were safe for their health. Carson reconciles and attempts to persuade the public to consider the idea that DDT, which in the 1950s and 60s was one of the many chemical pesticides being manufactured and sold to individuals for use on their home lawns, were indeed unsafe for applications on lawns and around children. Carson presents the argument suggesting perhaps human beings would not want to spray pesticides such as DDT around homes, children, and offices without ascertaining any adverse dangers and risks associated with these pesticides. Carson addresses these understandable concerns utilizing logical, emotional, and ethical appeal. Carson expresses her concerns in the thesis statement, \u201cTo a large extent, the physical form and the habits of the Earth\u2019s vegetation and its animal life have been molded by the environment,\u201d (Carson, 1962). Analysis \u201cCan anyone believe it is possible to lay down such a barrage of poisons on the surface of the earth without making it unfit for all life?\u201d (Carson, 1962) Rachel Carson\u2019s argumentative essay is written to enlighten humanity on the evil being bestowed upon the Earth\u2019s microscopic worlds and biological systems via the invasions of harmful mutating chemicals that will potentially affect future generations and their health. Carson proposes insecticides initially made to function as bug repellants and aid in protecting valuable crops has become victim to Darwin\u2019s principles. Insects adapt genetically and Carson feared that insects like mosquitos, among others types, may surpass us in their superior ability to overcome genetic challenges by bouncing back in more numerous quantities contributing to the ongoing survival of their species regardless of the genetic chemicals. If insects were suddenly able to adapt to chemicals this would mean they would also adapt to vaccines that protect us. While appealing to \u201clogos, ethos, and pathos\u201d (Paull, 2013) Carson explains how the \u201c\u2026 remaining harmful chemicals pass by underground streams\u2026 until they emerge\u2026 and work unknown harm on those who drink from once pure wells.\u201d (Carson, 1962) Unless a solution can be organized into existence these conditions will persist ultimately threatening future generations and could presumably lead to disastrous events for humanity. Carson says our obligation of endurance is essentially paired with a specific need for a responsible and logical solution to \u201cthe matter-at-hand consisting of a contaminated Earth ingrained with the ongoing contamination of rivers, streams and seas via these dangerous and lethal man-made genetic materials that get into DNA segments and clog up our primal informative circuitry\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson describes the slippery slope when she compares chemicals sprayed on croplands or forests to Strontium 90. Carson appeals to our emotions (pathos) by arousing feelings towards the future generations and safety our children; the hardships they may endure unless a solution is accomplished. Carson explains: \u201cStrontium 90, released through nuclear explosions into the air\u2026 and in time takes up its abode in the bones of a human being, there to remain until his death\u2026 similarly, chemicals sprayed on croplands\u2026 entering into living organisms\u2026 they combine into new forms that kill vegetation, sicken cattle, and work unknown harm on those who drink from once pure wells\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson subtly conveys her writing in just the right writing technique so that it grabs the reader\u2019s interest without biasing the whole article. Rachel criticizes opposing thoughts subtly by keeping it simple yet informative and persuasive; this makes it readable and proves effective in validating her point of view. Carson appeals to anyone that is concerned with the global environment and the future of humanity by focusing on what the world would be like in the absence of mutated creatures, and noticeably since it was written during the 1950s, I felt the subsequent statement made in Carson\u2019s essay was very powerful. Carson states, \u201cIt is ironic to think that man might determine his own future by something as seemingly trivial as the choice of an insect spray\u201d (Carson 1962). An example of the severity of this issue is when Rachel Carson was allowed to address the Supreme Court on this issue. Perhaps this essay also was targeted towards certain companies at the time, such as DuPont. Carson\u2019s essay foreshadows the environmental movement of the 60\u2032s and was considered among scholars to be \u201cone of the most influential\n\nquestion: What is the aim of 'The Obligation to Endure'?\n\nyour answer:": {"response": "To enlighten humanity on the evil bestowed upon the Earth\u2019s microscopic worlds and biological systems via the invasions of harmful mutating chemicals and the potential risks to future generations and health.", "usage": 1130}, "You are an answer-extraction expert.

Carson appeals to the arousal of the basic emotions such as the arousal of fear in the public, but not in such a way that would overly scare someone and turn them off due to excessiveness. Carson also appeals to pathos, or the emotions, by morally questioning the \u201chighly intelligent\u201d creators of these pesticides. Carson believes illogical reasoning and poor decisions based on \u2018collapsible evidence\u2019 threaten the future existence of mankind (Carson, 1962). In psychology it is said that humans \u201cbehave based on feelings of arousal\u201d (Smith, 1984). Carson appeals to this concept of arousal in humans by stirring up emotions such as fear by suggesting these pesticides led to impure water wells, air pollution, and other negative environmental impacts that could lead to disastrous effects. Carson opens this argumentative essay with an analytical opening. Carson uses support for her thesis through-out the essay which includes one excerpt, \u201cAlong with the possibility of the extinction of mankind by nuclear war, the central problem of our age has therefore become the contamination of man\u2019s total environment with such substances of incredible potential for harm-substances that accumulate in the tissues of plants and animals and even penetrate the germ cells to shatter or alter the very material of heredity upon which the shape of the future depends\u201d (Carson, 1962). Furthermore, the preceding statement supports Carson\u2019s intention to present an informative, persuasive, and logical point of view without shocking or confusing the reader. Carson presents the problem calmly in the opening paragraph and states her claim as a practical approach to stop or decrease the amount of the spraying of DDT pesticides in combined efforts to stop the super races of insects like mosquitoes for example from becoming immune. Including this support for her thesis Carson argues mosquitoes becoming immune to the man-made vaccines presently available would inarguably have serious, detrimental and adverse negative impacts upon the effectiveness of the survival of our own species by rendering the adverse effects of malaria vaccines available as one negative impact resulting from spraying of DDT. Carson refers to mosquitoes as \u201cunwanted species\u201d and explains how \u201cfuture historians\u201d are presented with certain challenges (Carson, 1962). Some of these challenges will be caused from the inability of mankind to logically think on a wide scale level about the effects of using mass produced pesticides on our environment. Carson suggests genetic level tampering of the codes of insects could render us humans very susceptible to certain types of unwanted diseases. Carson writes: \u201cFuture historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind? Yet this is exactly what we have done,\u201d (Carson, 1962). Carson establishes a neutral ground with the opposition upon the concluding paragraphs of her essay explaining that she was not arguing the need for insect control, \u201ccontrol must be geared to realities, not to mythical situations, and that the methods employed must be such that they do not destroy us along with the insects\u201d (Carson 1962). This is a great effort on Carson\u2019s part and portrayed a positive image that represented a valid controversial issue asking for a logical solution. Conclusion In my opinion Rachel Carson wrote a very balanced essay that was easy to read, appealed to everyone such as men, patient readers, humans, and women as well that may have been interested. \u201cThe Obligation of Endurance\u201d was a very influential piece and the world would be very different today without this essay. I especially admire Rachel Carson for her tenacity to speak publically on such a controversial topic at such a time during the 1950s. This showed enormous amounts of bravery and strength on her part as she was experiencing health problems of her own at the time of her speech to the Supreme Court in 1963. I like that Carson kept a calm clean point of view and offered valid questions that were easy to read and understand and rendered these problems capable of being solved with some critical thinking and cooperation. She did not present any \u201clow blows\u201d and did not seek to offend the opposition blindly. Carson was very clear when stating her intentions pertaining to solving this issue and this is what aided her and contributed to her success in influencing the banning of pesticide DDT in the United States and other smaller African regions following this essay; she truly is a gifted writer.
